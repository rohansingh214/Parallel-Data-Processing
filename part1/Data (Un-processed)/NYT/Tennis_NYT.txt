b'ON TENNIS'
b'By Christopher Clarey'
b'Not much head scratching is required when it comes to deciding how to start a wish list for tennis in 2019.'
b'A sport that has long been concerned about punching below its weight spent too much of last year elbowing itself in the ribs as its too-numerous leaders traded blows and crossed purposes.'
b'This is no way to run a niche sport concerned about market and mind share in a ruthlessly competitive global entertainment landscape. Improvement is all the more urgent with tennis\xe2\x80\x99s biggest stars, Roger Federer and Serena Williams, both 37.'
b'And so with a new season about to get serious with the start of the Australian Open on Monday, my No. 1 wish for tennis is unity. In an ideal world, that would mean unified governance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will never happen, but what we need more than anything is a commissioner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brad Gilbert, the longtime player, coach and analyst.'
b'That would require each of tennis\xe2\x80\x99s seven governing bodies to cede some of its authority, a situation that would probably require an existential threat to the game\xe2\x80\x99s viability or profitability.'
b'In an imperfect but still better world, unity could also mean a genuine players\xe2\x80\x99 union \xe2\x80\x94 why not men and women together while we\xe2\x80\x99re wishing? \xe2\x80\x94 that could make for more meaningful progress on tennis\xe2\x80\x99s now-intractable issues through tough negotiations with those who own and operate the tournaments.'
b'In the current system, the players and regular tour events are in partnership, an unusual arrangement in professional sports that can make consensus and change difficult.'
b'Novak Djokovic, back at No. 1 and president of the ATP Player Council, has explored the concept. But for now, a union appears to be wishful thinking: too many legal and logistical hurdles.'
b'But the sport can still do better at finding common ground in 2019.'
b'Start with agreeing on a more coherent schedule that does not include three men\xe2\x80\x99s team events within less than four months: the Laver Cup in September 2019, the revamped Davis Cup in November 2019 and the revived ATP Cup in January 2020.'
b'Continue by creating a meaningful mixed men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s team event that will carry on the legacy of the Hopman Cup. Further embrace tennis\xe2\x80\x99s ability to showcase men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s stars in the same events \xe2\x80\x94 a longtime strength that other sports are interested in replicating.'
b'Reach an agreement on coaching that will apply to all sectors of the pro game. The women\xe2\x80\x99s tour currently allows on-court coaching visits once a set while the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour and main-draw Grand Slam events do not allow any coaching during play.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we have it, we should have it nonstop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simona Halep, the women\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t, we should stop completely.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Halep prefers letting players solve their own tactical and psychological issues under pressure, as do I and plenty of others. But the existing coaching situation is confusing to fans and disorienting to women\xe2\x80\x99s players, who have to change routines in the tournaments that matter most. In light of the difficulty for umpires to fully police player-coach communication, perhaps allowing signals from the box and only the box is the right compromise.'
b'More tennis wishes for 2019:'
b'ELIMINATE LETS ON SERVES A point or a tournament can already end with a net-cord winner during a rally when a groundstroke, volley or overhead hits the tape and trickles over. Why should a serve be treated any differently? This will also speed play, slightly reduce costs (sensors are used to detect lets) and bring pro tennis in line with college tennis.'
b'ELIMINATE PLAYERS\xe2\x80\x99 RIGHT to catch a service toss without penalty. If a player chooses not to hit the ball once tossed, it should count as a missed serve. This will also speed play and, in making the ideal toss more elusive, take away a smidgen of a server\xe2\x80\x99s advantage.'
b'MAKE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT to push tournaments to use balls from the same brands or at least with the same characteristics during the different surface swings: hard court, clay court, grass and indoor. Few things irritate players more than significant disparity between balls week to week, and there is concern that abrupt changes can lead to injury. The ATP is working on this issue. Time to hurry up.'
b'PROVIDE PLAYERS AND COACHES with detailed information about court speed and ball characteristics well in advance of a tournament to allow competitors to better prepare. This might also help reduce injuries.'
b'PERMIT FANS TO ENTER A STADIUM as the players change ends after the first game of a set. The current policy, which typically does not allow fans to enter until the changeover after the third game, leaves too many paying customers waiting for too long.'
b'COOPERATE TO DEVELOP JUST ONE MAJOR RATING SYSTEM for tennis players, be they professional or amateur. The Universal Tennis Rating, with the backing of strong private investors, is making inroads. But the International Tennis Federation is also creating its own rating system and algorithm. Such a system is an important concept that could simplify and improve the transition to the professional game. Why create more tennis confusion with competing systems instead of joining forces to produce one that will be universally accepted?'
b'FAIRER USE OF WILD CARDS The Grand Slam tournaments should no longer allow reciprocal wild card entry to players from other Grand Slam nations. It is elitism. And the new-look Davis Cup should definitely not be granting two wild cards to its 18-team final phase. It is anti-competitive.'
b'MORE CONSISTENCY IN APPLYING THE RULES on coaching violations, the timing of line-call challenges and the eligibility of convicted administrators to serve on the ITF board of directors.'
b'A MEN\xe2\x80\x99S GRAND SLAM SINGLES CHAMPION UNDER AGE 30 (there are none active at the moment) and a new French Open men\xe2\x80\x99s champion. And a first major title for South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Anderson, which would be the first for an African in singles in 38 years.'
b'ONE MORE MAJOR for Petra Kvitova, who has come back so inspirationally from adversity. Another chance in a major final for Madison Keys to conquer her nerves and play to her potential.'
b'MORE VARIETY IN COURT SPEEDS on tour, fewer injury timeouts. More open roofs, less pain for Andy Murray. More drop-shot returns, fewer tweeners. More integrity, fewer conflicts of interest. More conversations, fewer social-media posts. More players, fewer hitters.'

b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Brazilian tennis player Joao Souza has been provisionally suspended again amid a corruption investigation by the Tennis Integrity Unit.'
b'Souza had already been provisionally suspended on March 29 but was reinstated on April 8 following a successful appeal.'
b'The TIU says that the provisional suspension has been put back in place "following consideration of additional evidence submitted by the TIU," adding that no more appeals will be accepted.'
b'No further details were given for the reason of the suspension.'
b'The 30-year old Souza is currently ranked No. 422, having reached a career-high of No. 69 in 2015.'
b'Also in 2015, Souza played in the longest Davis Cup singles match ever, losing to Leonardo Mayer of Argentina 15-13 in the fifth set after 6 hours, 42 minutes.'
b'The TIU is a joint initiative of the Grand Slam Board, the International Tennis Federation and the ATP and the WTA tours.'

b'TORONTO \xe2\x80\x94 In a subterranean food court in downtown Toronto, shoppers bustled past Maria Patrascu without a glance, unaware that the young woman sipping green tea was the leader of a growing rebellion in professional tennis.'
b'A year ago at this time, Patrascu was a little-known left-hander playing obscure tournaments in Egypt as she tried to get her world ranking under 600. But now she is unable to enter tournaments because of controversial new International Tennis Federation rules designed to slash the ranks of pro players.'
b'So instead of playing, Patrascu, 22, remains at home, seeking to upset the I.T.F.\xe2\x80\x99s new World Tennis Tour one signature at a time. But what began as a petition has turned into a surging player revolt that Patrascu, more than any other player, has helped bring to light.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt started out rebellious, but it has definitely evolved,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a movement to pursue justice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'About 10 months ago, Patrascu began reading how the I.T.F., one of four governing bodies in tennis, planned to introduce a complicated string of rules to restructure the lower levels of the sport. Patrascu grew alarmed that she and hundreds of young players like her would find it far more difficult to get into tournaments and pursue a tennis career.'
b'Last March, Patrascu started an online petition to halt the changes. For many months, it gathered only a modest response \xe2\x80\x94 about 2,400 signatures through December. But once the changes took effect in January and thousands of aspiring players felt the full force of the new rules, support for her petition soared.'
b'It added more than 12,000 new signatures in just the last six weeks and now has more than 14,500. With Patrascu leading the way, supporters have already extracted one concession from the I.T.F., with more possibly on the way.'
b'The movement continues to grow, and some players have met with lawyers to discuss a lawsuit against the I.T.F. Dave Miley, a former federation official and coach who has also opposed the new rules, praised Patrascu and the players and coaches who have joined the fight.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she and other players are doing is admirable, and they have cause,\xe2\x80\x9d Miley said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, 14,000 voices out there are not uninformed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Professional tennis has several tiers, much like baseball with its major leagues and several levels of minor leagues below them. The best and most famous tennis players play in ATP or WTA tournaments. The rest, as many as 14,000 of them, toil anonymously around the globe in small events that are supposed to serve as tennis\xe2\x80\x99s talent incubator.'
b'Patrascu is one of those. Born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1997, she moved to Toronto with her parents when she was 5. She showed promise as a junior, winning the Canadian under-14 championship, and turned professional at 18. But her career-high ranking is No. 615 in the I.T.F. and No. 819 in the WTA.'
b'Most players\xe2\x80\x99 chances of making it to stardom are slim, and for many, it is challenging to just break even financially after paying for travel, training and other expenses. That is why the I.T.F., after commissioning an extensive study, declared the old structure unsustainable. Too many marginal players were basically masquerading as professionals.'
b'The I.T.F.\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to promote tennis around the world, and the organization works to ensure that there are tournaments on all continents. But those events have been open to all comers, and they have included players with little hope of breaking into the top tier \xe2\x80\x94 some of them over 50 years old. The I.T.F. study determined that in one year, as many as 6,000 so-called professional players did not earn even $1. A recent independent investigation also found that there was a \xe2\x80\x9ctsunami\xe2\x80\x9d of fixed matches at the lower levels, where players earning little prize money are vulnerable to betting syndicates.'
b'The I.T.F. determined that the best model for professional tennis should include no more than 750 men and 750 women. It recommended new rules to restructure the tour, effectively eliminating almost 13,000 aspirants.'
b'The new system is intended to provide an easier path for the top 100 juniors to matriculate via easier access to bigger tournaments, perhaps at the expense, opponents say, of other players who develop at later ages. (A certain number of spots are reserved at some events for the players in the top 100 junior rankings.) With a smaller pool of truly professional players, the I.T.F. hopes, the meager prize money and ranking points offered at the lower levels could be distributed more efficiently.'
b'But Patrascu, and many others who are taking to various platforms to vent their anger, say that hard-working players with real potential are being caught up in the cull as tournament sizes are reduced and ranking points become more difficult to attain.'
b'Patrascu said she received so many messages every day from frustrated players detailing their own problems with the new tour that she was unable to reply to them all.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re killing the players\xe2\x80\x99 dreams, just to end up with a handful of really, really good players,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of the I.T.F. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the rest are forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In December, the I.T.F. granted Patrascu a one-hour conference call with the federation officials Jackie Nesbitt and Andrew Moss. Patrascu later said she felt she had let her fellow players down on that call, because she could not stop the new plan.'
b'Then, in January, the new tour was introduced and Patrascu\xe2\x80\x99s WTA ranking disappeared, she said. The most jarring change for most players is the limit on entrants for the qualifying rounds, the mini tournaments that allow fringe players to play their way into the main draws, where modest prize money and ranking points were up for grabs. These entries were cut to 24.'
b'In the past, many tournaments had large qualifying draws of 48, 64 or even occasionally 128 players.'
b'Patrascu explained how the changes in the size of qualifying draws have affected her boyfriend, Kevin Portmann of Italy, who went to a tournament in Tunisia last month and was required to play two pre-qualifying matches on the day he arrived. That was just to get into the qualifying rounds. She said she could not afford to travel to Africa or Europe for tournaments with little hope of reaching the main draw.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to win five matches just to be in position to play someone who is totally fresh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Players are fuming because they now require more points to move up in the rankings, but it is harder to get into the tournaments to get those points. Also, doubles specialists are at a greater disadvantage because singles rankings are now used to determine entry into the doubles draws.'
b'As the new reality sinks in, many players and their coaches, families and friends are turning to Patrascu\xe2\x80\x99s petition. Some have followed her initiative with Facebook pages, like the one with a banner headline that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Kill Tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d Rafael Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, who runs the player\xe2\x80\x99s academy, spoke out against the new rules in an Instagram video this month.'
b'The I.T.F. insisted that Patrascu\xe2\x80\x99s petition contained \xe2\x80\x9cinaccuracies\xe2\x80\x9d and said that much of the other criticism had been \xe2\x80\x9cuninformed.\xe2\x80\x9d But, under siege, it made its first amendment to the new rules last month by expanding qualifying draws to 32 players. The federation also promised to continue monitoring the rules and to act accordingly.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we are listening to the players,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kris Dent, the I.T.F.\xe2\x80\x99s senior executive director for pro circuits. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be foolish not to listen to our constituents. Change is never easy, but in this case it is vital.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Patrascu said she was encouraged by the revision but said it should only be the start. Meanwhile, her days are spent training indoors in Toronto and stoking the budding rebellion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this for myself, especially because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where my career is headed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time that I\xe2\x80\x99ve dedicated to it is really from the bottom of my heart. I wish players could have more opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The United States Clay Court Championships, a men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis tournament that ended Sunday in Houston, signaled something beyond the transition from the hardcourt season to clay.'
b'It marked the end of the tennis tours\xe2\x80\x99 two-month American swing, which featured six tournaments, including two of the biggest tournaments outside of the four Grand Slam events \xe2\x80\x94 the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., and the Miami Open.'
b'As the ATP and WTA Tours shift to the red clay and grass courts of Europe, the next major events in the United States won\xe2\x80\x99t come until the hardcourt season in July in the lead-up to the United States Open.'
b'And after the U.S. Open wraps up in early September, the tennis tours depart again, spending much of end of the season in Asia.'
b'American tennis fans used to have more options. In 1990, 24 of 55 WTA events were in the United States. But with the sale of the Connecticut Open in New Haven this year, only seven of 55 WTA events currently on the 2019 calendar are on American soil. Five of those seven are joint events with men, including the U.S. Open, Indian Wells and Miami.'
b'On the men\xe2\x80\x99s side, 16 of 77 worldwide ATP events in 1990 took place in the United States. This year, 11 of 63 will be.'
b'At one time, both the men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s year-end tour finals were played at Madison Square Garden, but now the men\xe2\x80\x99s event takes place in London and the women\xe2\x80\x99s is in Shenzhen, China. Smaller tournaments in the United States have had trouble selling enough tickets and sponsorships to stay financially viable. And there was even some concern that the Miami Open, which was looking for a new stadium site last year, might be lured out of the country.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we will ever become a U.S.-centric tour again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly room for growth for a couple more events, but I think the growth will be in that the events that are here in the States will continue to get bigger. But I do think that we have moved to having a global footprint versus being focused primarily in one country.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Simon said that the WTA planned to introduce two new events in the United States, one beginning this year and another in 2020, both of which will take place the week before the U.S. Open. The location of the 2019 tournament, which would bring the total of WTA events in the country to eight, is expected to be announced in May.'
b'The decline in the number of American tournaments over the last three decades corresponds with the decline in the number of Americans atop the world rankings \xe2\x80\x94 especially on the men\xe2\x80\x99s side \xe2\x80\x94 and the growth of tennis in Europe and Asia.'
b'In December 1990, seven of the top 20 men\xe2\x80\x99s players in the world were Americans, including household names like Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang and John McEnroe.'
b'The current rankings feature only John Isner at No. 10 among the top 20, followed by Frances Tiafoe at No. 29. They are the only American men in the top 50, and no American man has won a Grand Slam event since Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open in 2003. Since then, Europeans, led by Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s Roger Federer, Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Rafael Nadal and Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s Novak Djokovic, have won 59 of the 61 major titles.'
b'Women\xe2\x80\x99s tournaments fled the United States even though Serena and Venus Williams were dominant players over the past 20 years and are the reason many current American players took up tennis.'
b'With more than half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population in Asia, the WTA looked to that continent as a pillar of growth, said Stacey Allaster, the chief executive of professional tennis for the United States Tennis Association and a former leader of the WTA.'
b'In 1990, there were only four WTA tournaments in Asia. This season there are 11 in China alone, part of a tennis boom fueled by the success of Li Na.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s about the quantity of events\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States, Allaster said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need successful events.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And for smaller tournaments, being successful can be tough.'
b'When Anne Worcester, the tournament director of the Connecticut Open, realized the tournament was no longer economically viable, she attempted to find a new title sponsor for the event in New Haven.'
b'She considered offers from various American cities, but ultimately sold the tournament to the highest bidder, APG, a sports and entertainment company with a strong footprint in Asia. This year, the tournament, which used to be held the week before the U.S. Open, will be in Zhengzhou, China, the week after the Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been very emotional to let go of something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve birthed and nurtured for 21 years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Worcester, who was the chief executive of the WTA from 1994 to \xe2\x80\x9998. \xe2\x80\x9cMy kids are 21 and 23, so it was really like having a third child. But the economics were so clear and because I was leading the charge to secure a title sponsor as well as cultivate bidders around the world, I just saw the writing on the wall. As much as our board didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell, there was just no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Worcester said it was hard to sell tickets and sponsorships in part because there were fewer American stars to promote. The Connecticut Open in recent years has featured European stars like Simona Halep, Petra Kvitova and Caroline Wozniacki.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn this global sport of tennis, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to promote non-Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d Worcester said. \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans want to see Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She remembered her time as the director of worldwide operations for the Virginia Slims Tour, which began in 1970, organized by Billie Jean King and backed by the Philip Morris company.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust in the United States of America, Virginia Slims had 17 named tournaments in the major markets of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Worcester said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis was filling arenas, indoor and outdoors. It was a very different era, a very different economy, a different product. There were more American players that were on a first-name basis with the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The bleeding may have stopped on WTA events leaving the United States. Interest was high in the New Haven event, Worcester said, because global bidders knew that a tournament of its caliber would not be sold again for a long time.'
b'When the men\xe2\x80\x99s Memphis Open faced declining profit and failed to secure a title sponsor several years ago, Josh Ripple feared the event might be purchased by a company that would move the tournament outside the United States.'
b'Ripple, a former president of the WTA Tour, is the executive vice president of GF Sports, a New York-based events company that owns and operates several pro sports events.'
b'In 2015, an affiliate of GF Sports purchased the tournaments in Memphis and Atlanta from the U.S.T.A. and committed to not letting them leave the United States, Ripple said.'
b'After speaking with representatives from Nashville; Columbus, Ohio; Seattle; Dallas; and Phoenix, Ripple and his company moved the Memphis event in 2018 to the renovated Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, where it was held in February. (The Racquet Club in Memphis, which hosted the tournament for 40 years, is closing this spring and will be turned into a hotel and apartment complexes.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, it can have a nice long stay in New York,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said, adding that he liked \xe2\x80\x9cplaying in the United States as much as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Patrick McEnroe, an ESPN analyst, said that the major American events like the U.S. Open, Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati are stronger and more popular than ever but that the lower-level events like the New York Open might continue to face difficulties.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, the only way that those can get back to being consistently viable year after year is if at the top we have more American tennis players close to the top that have personality that can sell some tickets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'ORDINO, Andorra \xe2\x80\x94 As a brave whistleblower, Marco Trungelliti should be feeling good about himself. The Argentine player exposed match-fixing crooks in tennis, helped the fight against the criminal gambling syndicates that are corroding his sport from within and testified about dishonest fellow professionals who, in part thanks to his evidence, are now banned.'
b"But instead, the 29-year-old says doing the right thing cost him dearly. Ranked No. 139, he's one of the few players so established in the sport willing to speak frankly about the fixers who pay athletes to lose so they can profit from bets on the crooked results. The price of Trungelliti's honesty has been rejection by other players and stress that hurt his health and his game."
b"Compounding his unhappiness, Trungelliti also feels he's been left out to dry by tennis administrators and their anti-corruption investigators. Having pumped him for evidence, he says they failed to publicly defend him against those in tennis who muddied his name, questioned his motives for giving evidence and labeled him a rat."
b'"They just used me," he says. "They just dropped me in the middle of the sea."'
b'"It was a disaster, disaster. In my opinion, it was one of the worst procedures that I have ever seen," he adds. "I\'m still paying the price."'
b'Trungelliti caused a sensation at the French Open last year when he, his younger brother, mother and 88-year-old grandmother squeezed into a rental car and dashed 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from Spain to Roland Garros so he could fill a "lucky loser" spot at the Grand Slam tournament that opened at the last minute when injured players withdrew.'
b"What few knew at the time was that behind his easy smile, thick curls and feel-good 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 first-round victory against Australian Bernard Tomic, Trungelliti was shouldering a weighty secret: He'd been a key witness in a match-fixing probe that snared three fellow Argentines, testifying even though he knew that, back in Argentina, he'd likely face a backlash for doing so."
b"Best-known of the three was Nicolas Kicker, at No. 84, the highest-ranked player convicted so far of fixing matches. The Tennis Integrity Unit, the sport's anti-corruption body with 17 full-time staffers, an annual budget of nearly $5 million and veteran ex-police investigators, announced Kicker's guilt just three days before the French Open, where he had been preparing to play. Neither the TIU nor Trungelliti gave even the slightest hint at the time of the role he'd played."
b"In the aftermath, however, Trungelliti noticed player attitudes changing toward him. Even some he regarded as friends asked why he didn't keep his mouth shut."
b'"No one was saying \'Hi\' any more. No one was looking at me," he says. "It\'s sad."'
b'Contacted by The Associated Press, the TIU said it couldn\'t comment because of its "long-standing confidentiality policy with regard to disciplinary hearings and witness evidence."'
b'Behind the scenes, Trungelliti has repeatedly contacted the unit, asking without success for it to defend him.'
b'"Due to my participation in the trial, I receive all kinds of insults from players to managers," he emailed the TIU last August. "They are trying soil my honor."'
b"Trungelliti's wife, Nadir, says there were times when the stress reduced him to tears. When he was playing, he just wanted to be home. He smashed rackets. A back injury flared again."
b"But he's not shutting up."
b'Trungelliti says match-fixing is an open secret in the game and getting worse.'
b'"It\'s not just the players\' problem," he says. "There are a lot of coaches involved. A lot. A lot. More than we think."'
b'"If you are weak mentally, then you go in, you are all in, for sure, because it\'s easy money," he says. "If you think about it, this is like one hour working for one hundred thousand dollars."'
b'The evidence bears him out.'
b'An investigation commissioned by tennis administrators concluded last December that betting-related corruption is "particularly acute and pervasive" at lower- and mid-level Futures and Challenger tournaments, below the top-tier ATP tour.'
b"Gambling syndicates often target players who, unlike the sport's multi-millionaire stars, struggle to make a good living. In Belgium, prosecutors say they identified 137 mostly lower-level players , from more than a half-dozen countries, suspected of having worked with an Armenian-led gang rolled up last June that allegedly paid 500 to 3,000 euros ($570 to $3,400) for fixed matches and sets. Police say the syndicate employed mules, people hired for a few dollars to place bets small enough to slip under the radar of gambling watchdogs. Two other match-fixing operations were broken up in Spain , in June and October."
b'Trungelliti says he felt compelled to come forward when he was approached in July 2015 by a fixer who posed as a potential sponsor and was introduced via his coach. He wrote to the TIU, saying the fixer "asked me to keep quiet."'
b'"But I can\'t because I hate this," he wrote. "Can you please tell me what I can do? I have his name, his telephone number and a few things he told me."'
b'Those "things" proved explosive.'
b'In a subsequent hour-long interview with a TIU investigator and in a four-page witness statement, Trungelliti meticulously detailed what he knew. He said the fixer laid out a sliding scale of bribes: $2,000 to $3,000 for fixed Futures matches; $5,000 to $10,000 in mid-level Challenger tournaments; $50,000 to $100,000 on the ATP tour where the biggest stars play.'
b"The fixer said he paid cash and communicated using encrypted, easily deleted text messages. He reeled off players he said he'd fixed matches with. Three leapt out at Trungelliti, all Argentines: Kicker, Patricio Heras and Federico Coria."
b'The fixer was particularly "proud" of a Challenger match fixed in Italy with Kicker, Trungelliti told the TIU. Kicker lost 6-1, 6-2 in 63 minutes to South Korea\'s Duckhee Lee, then ranked 74 spots below Kicker, at No. 278.'
b'Kicker is now serving a three-year ban, with the possibility of an additional three-year suspension hanging over him if he breaches anti-corruption rules again.'
b'Heras, whose career-best ranking was No. 269 in 2013, also is banned for three years, with an additional two years suspended .'
b"Coria was banned for two months, with another six months suspended, for failing to report that he was offered money in July 2015 to lose a set at a Futures tournament in Italy and for not telling the TIU of another approach a month later to lose several matches. The TIU specified that Coria hadn't actually taken money or fixed games. But the TIU investigator who questioned Coria testified there was evidence in his iPhone of contacts with the fixer who also sought to groom Trungelliti."
b"Whether the fixer is still operating is unclear. The TIU hasn't announced any sanctions against the fixer or said whether it shared Trungelliti's testimony about him with police."
b"As painful as the whistleblowing process has been for Trungelliti, he says he'd go through it again if he had to. He says he reported a separate approach by another fixer in 2016."
b'His TIU witness statement neatly summed up his thinking.'
b'"I love tennis," he testified. "I feel very saddened by the state of tennis and the fact that match-fixing is happening so often."'

b'(Reuters) - Brazilian Joao Souza has been provisionally suspended for the second time this year amid a corruption investigation, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) said on Friday.'
b'Souza, ranked 422nd in the world, was initially suspended on March 29 due to alleged breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program but was reinstated this month following a successful appeal.'
b'However, the TIU said the suspension has been reimposed "following consideration of additional evidence", adding that no more appeals will be accepted.'
b'"The effect of the provisional suspension is that Mr Souza is ineligible to compete in or attend any sanctioned event organized or recognized by the governing bodies of the sport," the TIU said in a statement http://www.tennisintegrityunit.com/media-releases/brazilian-tennis-player-joao-souza-provisionally-suspended-independent-anti-corruption-hearing-officer.'
b'Souza, who turned professional in 2006, has never won an ATP Tour title as he has spent the majority of his career on the Challenger circuit. '
b'The 30-year-old reached his career-high singles ranking of number 69 in 2015.'
b'More tennis players were disciplined for violations of anti-corruption rules in 2018 than in any other year since the creation of the TIU 10 years ago.'
b'Eight lifetime bans were imposed last year, most notably to Italian former world number 49 Daniele Bracciali for match-fixing and facilitating betting.'

b'DELRAY BEACH, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Dan Evans finished a practice session last month, grabbed a racket by the strings and marched from the court toward the player locker room.'
b'It was the same path walked by Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro the night before. For del Potro, a flash mob gathered as fans chanted \xe2\x80\x9cOl\xc3\xa9, Ol\xc3\xa9, Ol\xc3\xa9, Delpo, Delpo,\xe2\x80\x9d and implored the popular Argentine to autograph photos, tennis balls, hats, T-shirts and even one man\xe2\x80\x99s bald head.'
b'When Evans walked the route, just hours before he was to take the court against Radu Albot in the final of the Delray Beach Open on Feb. 24, no one stopped him to chat or ask for his autograph. Not a single spectator recognized Evans, a 28-year-old Briton.'
b'He was alone with his thoughts. But he was used to that.'
b'For more than a year, Evans spent most of his time alone after being barred from the ATP Tour for a positive drug test for cocaine. Evans said that while he used cocaine recreationally and out of competition, which is not prohibited in tennis, he tested positive during the Barcelona Open in April 2017 when he left some of the drug in a bag that contaminated other medication.'
b'Evans, who was ranked a career-high No. 41 at the time of his ban, had recently reached his first career ATP final in Sydney. He did not appeal the charge.'
b'The Delray Beach Open was only his fourth ATP Tour tournament since his return in April 2018. He lost the final to Albot in a third-set tiebreaker despite holding three match points, but his ranking is up to No. 100 as he begins the qualifying tournament for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., on Tuesday.'
b'With no ability to play tournaments or train during the ban, Evans retreated to his home in Cheltenham on the outskirts of the picturesque Cotswolds, some 90 miles northwest of London. He was forbidden to even practice at any facilities affiliated with Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Lawn Tennis Association for 10 months.'
b'He filled his days quietly playing golf and watching television, though he refused to tune in to any tennis matches. He said he would not even follow tournament results in the newspaper. Some days, he said, it was too painful to leave the house.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a really tough time in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Evans said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there were a lot of other people around me who had a difficult year as well. I would be selfish to think that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t affect everyone else in my life.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose feelings of anger and hurt at what you did to people don\xe2\x80\x99t go away easily,\xe2\x80\x9d Evans added, referring to the pain and embarrassment he caused his family, his girlfriend and a bevy of coaches and supporters.'
b'This was not the first time he had been penalized. In 2006, Evans was pulled from the Wimbledon junior tournament by the L.T.A., the national governing body the sport, for unacceptable on-court behavior. Two years later, he was suspended by the L.T.A. for four months after he was photographed during Wimbledon at a nightclub in the early morning hours. And in 2010, the L.T.A. stopped financially supporting him for underperformance and a poor attitude.'
b'Evans was unranked when he returned from this latest suspension in April 2018 and was forced to start at the lower levels of professional tennis. With no points to defend, and little compassion from his fellow competitors, Evans began entering Challengers, tennis\xe2\x80\x99s version of the minor leagues. He often had to play three matches just to get into the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s main draw. But in August he won a Challenger in Vancouver, British Columbia, and reached the final of another in France in February.'
b'At the ATP Tour level, he was given a wild card to play the event at Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Club in London in June and lost his first match. He tried to qualify for Wimbledon last year, reaching the second round. He qualified for the main draw of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open and lost to Roger Federer in the second round. His breakthrough at Delray Beach included wins over No. 9 John Isner and No. 35 Frances Tiafoe.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn retrospect, his journey has been incredibly quick for someone with no ranking,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Felgate, Tim Henman\xe2\x80\x99s longtime coach, who began working with Evans just after his return. \xe2\x80\x9cDan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything from anyone; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect sympathy. He knows what he did to himself. But it does give him a different perspective and may prolong his career. When you realized you missed a year, you want to make up for it. You want this career to go on for a long time because you know what not playing felt like.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At 5-foot-9, Evans lacks the serving power of tennis\xe2\x80\x99s taller players like del Potro, who is 6-6. But Evans is scrappy off the ground, particularly with his running forehand pass down the line. He also possesses an effective one-handed slice backhand. And he loves to volley, just as his countryman Henman did.'
b'As far as he has come over the last year, he knows he has still got a long way to go.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cListen, that episode in my life of being banned, it\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x9d Evans said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone forgave me as soon as I held my hands up and accepted the blame. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to be happy with yourself day in and day out when the fact is, I was No. 41 in the world and I threw it all away.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut to say that I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown, that would be justifying it. There\xe2\x80\x99s no sort of philosophical looking back on it. It was the worst thing ever. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m just back trying to win tennis matches.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Novak Djokovic played his first official tennis match in more than a month on Saturday night, defeating the American Bjorn Fratangelo in straight sets at the BNP Paribas Open.'
b'But Djokovic has hardly been taking an extended break from official tennis business.'
b'Back at No. 1 in the world by a hefty margin, he is also wielding his renewed clout off court as president of the ATP player council. As a result of his maneuvering, the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour is in need of a new chief executive along with some collective purpose and peace of mind, which are likely to remain more elusive than Djokovic and his allies might like.'
b'As ever, the tension is between the players, who understandably want to maximize their earnings in a brutally competitive sport, and their paymasters, who own and operate the tournaments and understandably would rather keep prize money under tight rein. But the unusual and inconvenient thing in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis is that the players and paymasters are part of the same internally conflicted organization: the ATP.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are really blocked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilles Simon, the French player and a former council member. \xe2\x80\x9cThe structure works against us and the imbalance being already there between the tournaments and the players, the imbalance endures.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Acrimony is inevitable. Progress is not. Last week, Djokovic and the players appeared to send a strong message when the player representatives on the ATP Tour\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors voted against extending the contract of Chris Kermode, the ATP\xe2\x80\x99s executive chairman and president, who will now be obliged to step down at the end of 2019.'
b'But such a political power play is only intimidating if the players are truly united, which seems far from the case.'
b'The player council, in a nonbinding vote before the board meeting, could not reach agreement on whether to recommend or reject Kermode\xe2\x80\x99s extension.'
b'In an age of constant communication, the biggest stars are somehow struggling to connect. Roger Federer, a former president of the player council, said Sunday that he had reached out to Djokovic before the vote only to be told that Djokovic could not squeeze him in.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said.'
b'Rafael Nadal, a supporter of Kermode and continuity, said his cellphone was primed and ready, but no calls or texts came his way.'
b'This sounds more like high school than a global professional sport.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are representing us, so normally they have to ask, what\xe2\x80\x99s our opinion? Not in every small decision, but in big decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, this one was a big decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The players and the tournaments each have three representatives on the ATP board of directors. The chairman \xe2\x80\x94 Kermode since 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 has the ability to cast a tiebreaking vote but would prefer to avoid it when possible for fear of endangering support from one side of the divide.'
b'It is a difficult dance even in the best of circumstances, and Kermode seems to have stepped on the wrong feet.'
b'Djokovic did not vote him out. That was up to the player representatives that he and the player council have supported or voted into place: David Egdes, a Tennis Channel executive; Alex Inglot, the director of communications at Sportradar; and Justin Gimelstob, the Tennis Channel commentator and former American player, who remains the most polarizing back-room figure in the sport and has remained in place despite facing felony battery charges.'
b'Under the ATP\xe2\x80\x99s voting system, Kermode needed majority support (at least two votes) from each camp to continue. He received all three of the tournament representatives\xe2\x80\x99 votes but apparently failed to get any of the player representatives\xe2\x80\x99 votes.'
b'In a letter to ATP staff last week after his ouster, Kermode said it was \xe2\x80\x9cironic\xe2\x80\x9d that he was leaving after \xe2\x80\x9cthe players have achieved some of the greatest gains in the history of the ATP Tour in the past five years.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kermode, a former low-level pro player and high-level tournament director, is a polished and genial Briton who knows how to work a room but apparently not every boardroom.'
b'Running the ATP Tour is a compromised position to begin with; the real power in tennis lies with the four Grand Slam tournaments, which function independently. Still, he navigated his position of weakness for more than five years, securing sponsorships and a hard-won prize money increase from the top tier of ATP tournaments.'
b'He also led the creation of new events like the Next Gen ATP Finals, designed to promote young players like 19-year-old Canadian Denis Shapovalov, who will eventually have to step out of the ink-black shadow cast by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I know of Chris, he was unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d Shapovalov said.'
b'But clearly not everyone is in the Kermode fan club.'
b'He is seen by some of the players as a \xe2\x80\x9ctournament guy,\xe2\x80\x9d a characterization he rejects. Others grumble about his handling of the ATP Cup, which will be relaunched in the opening week of the 2020 season in Australia.'
b'With the new-look Davis Cup using a similar format, Kermode tried to avoid a team-event glut by working toward a combined event. But he was overruled last year by the players.'
b'There is also criticism that he did not secure more prize money gains, above all from the four Grand Slam events. As council president, Federer once spearheaded a successful push for major increases, but with Grand Slam revenues growing, the concern is that prize money has not kept pace.'
b'Federer and Nadal could re-enter the fray. They talked tennis governance over coffee at Federer\xe2\x80\x99s rented house here last week. But for now, it is the 31-year-old Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s turn to lead on court and off. He is multitasking at a point in his career when family time is ever more important to him and when he is again on the verge of holding all four of the Grand Slam singles titles.'
b'Why bother with tennis politics at this stage?, I asked him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tend to ask that myself, as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I feel that it is my responsibility, in a way, as a top player to contribute to the sport in that way, as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Even if he charts a steadier course in the months to come, putting a more \xe2\x80\x9cplayer friendly\xe2\x80\x9d ATP chief in place looks all but impossible with the tournament representatives effectively possessing veto power on the board.'
b'Changing the governance structure, as Djokovic has suggested, sounds nearly as tricky.'
b'Craig Tiley, the chief executive of Tennis Australia and a driving force in the Australian Open\xe2\x80\x99s growth, would be a strong ATP leader and has been interested in the chief executive post in the past.'
b'But with mutual trust at low ebb and no player union in sight, it is likely a compromise candidate will take over.'
b'Sure, tennis needs change and fresh ideas. But when you tear down a building, it seems best to have a clear idea what will stand in its place.'

b'Burned out, struggling with depression and fed up with cyberbullying, Rebecca Marino, one of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s brightest prospects, quit tennis in 2013. A year into her comeback, she\xe2\x80\x99s climbing the rankings.'
b'By Ben Rothenberg'
b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 For the first point she played at a Grand Slam event in six years, Rebecca Marino hit an ace.'
b'She celebrated with a subtle fist pump, determined to have the best next act she could after a lengthy intermission during which she became the face of depression among athletes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get caught up in the moment, just going from tournament to tournament now,\xe2\x80\x9d Marino said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if I stop and think about it, then that\xe2\x80\x99s when I see that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool that I was able to do this, and to get this far, from no ranking to suddenly in the qualies of a Slam.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Marino lost, 6-2, 6-2, to Caroline Dolehide on Tuesday in the first round of Australian Open qualifying, limited by a back injury, which curtailed her off-season training. Despite her stiffness, Marino, 28, showed flashes of the power and clean ball-striking that sent her into the upper echelons of tennis seven years ago.'
b'With a percussive forehand and a booming serve that topped out at 120 miles per hour, Marino surged to a high of 38th in the rankings in the summer of 2011, when she was 20. Not a highly touted junior prospect, she had planned to enroll in college before her tennis successes mounted, catapulting her faster and further than she was prepared to handle.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot expecting it, I felt like I was thrown into this machine, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how it worked,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Marino stepped back from the sport for the first time in 2012, taking seven months off. After returning for several months, she retired in February 2013 at age 22.'
b'In a conference call announcing her decision, Marino revealed her struggles with depression; days earlier, she had discussed her social media abuse in an interview with The New York Times. Her leaving the sport was often attributed to one of those factors, or both of them, which Marino said was inaccurate in retrospect.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I look back, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say it was depression,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of her decision to stop playing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was burnout, and it was expectations put on my shoulders by myself and others, and I just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to cope. It kind of all came to a head in a big, giant burnout, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Though her absence was longer than most, Marino is not the only player to have stepped away from the sport because of burnout. Most notably, the top Australian Ash Barty took off nearly two years early in her career. Barty has become a top player in her return, and she defeated No. 1 Simona Halep in Sydney this week.'
b'For Marino, stepping away from tennis made her \xe2\x80\x9cable to become superhappy and enjoy my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. '
b'Marino\xe2\x80\x99s retirement at 22 generated considerable attention, particularly in her native Canada, where she was one of the brightest tennis prospects in generations. '
b'Her story resonated with others, but she felt uneasy being a touchstone for athletes struggling with depression. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something I was prepared for, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still something I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of grappling with,\xe2\x80\x9d Marino said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still a really private person, and so for people to come up to me and tell me all of the things they\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with, or how I\xe2\x80\x99ve affected them, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult sometimes, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what to say. Even though I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that I\xe2\x80\x99ve helped people, it can be overwhelming because I\xe2\x80\x99m not professionally trained to help people.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After retiring from tennis, Marino worked one summer for her family\xe2\x80\x99s construction business, pouring cement and digging through clay. She later began teaching tennis lessons and enrolled at the University of British Columbia, where she studied English literature. The works she enjoyed most, she said, were ones from the Victorian era that grappled with the effects of industrialization on society.'
b'In her second year, the university\xe2\x80\x99s rowing coach recruited her to join the team, knowing her athletic background and her family\xe2\x80\x99s extensive history in the sport. (Her uncle George Hungerford was an Olympic gold medalist in 1964.) Rowing improved Marino\xe2\x80\x99s fitness and helped expand her sense of identity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a competitive outlet through a team like that was superfun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt made me feel like I was a part of the university community. People didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me for my tennis anymore; they just looked at me as a student-athlete.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Marino was shaken in February 2017 when her father, Joe, received a prostate cancer diagnosis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter he finished chemo, I kind of took a step back and wanted to look at what was important in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with any regrets, and I thought that tennis was the one thing in my life that I kind of wish I had a do-over for.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She also wanted her father to see her play again. Marino weighed the idea of a return for months and gained confidence after serving as a hitting partner at a tournament in Vancouver, her hometown, in August 2017. '
b'A week before her next semester was to begin, Marino pulled out of her classes, quit her coaching job and moved to Montreal to begin working toward a full-fledged comeback at Tennis Canada\xe2\x80\x99s training center.'
b'After a false start because she did not re-enter tennis\xe2\x80\x99s antidoping program in time, Marino returned to the sport at its lowest rung last January, at a series of small tournaments in Turkey. She won her first 19 matches, including her first 30 sets. She worked throughout the year to bring her ranking to its current spot of 216th, which was enough to reach her goal of entering the Australian Open qualifying draw.'
b'Marino plans a long stay in the sport this time, and is working to ensure it is more pleasant and sustainable. She stays in better contact with friends, including more trips home to Vancouver, to help her keep one foot outside the sometimes suffocating tennis bubble.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends don\xe2\x80\x99t play tennis, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t care if I win or lose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just concerned about how I\xe2\x80\x99m doing as a person, if I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying myself, and when I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back so we can hang out. My whole structure this time around is a little bit different, and I have a lot of things outside of tennis that keep me grounded.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She added: \xe2\x80\x9cPreviously, I felt like my identity was just \xe2\x80\x98tennis player.\xe2\x80\x99 But now I have many things that form my identity, and I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m very whole and very balanced.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Marino hopes her triumphs off and on the court gain the same amount of attention as her rough times did. She wants people to see her as a real person instead of a headline.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubts in my mind that I\xe2\x80\x99m able to compete and be here,\xe2\x80\x9d Marino said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ever go back to that place again because I know who I am now, and I know what I need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Ranked No. 178 at the end of last season, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu set an ambitious goal for herself, it seemed: Climb high enough in the rankings to be able to get into the main draw of this year\xe2\x80\x99s second Grand Slam event, the French Open, in May.'
b'Time for a new goal.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo quickly, like everything is happening so quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed late Friday evening as she sat for an interview as a surprise finalist in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.'
b'Her run here at age 18 as an unseeded wild card has been a revelation, featuring a 6-0, 6-1 demolition of the former No. 1 Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza in the quarterfinals and a grueling 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory over sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina in the semifinals on Friday.'
b'Now ranked 60th, she is the first wild card to reach the final of this top-tier women\xe2\x80\x99s tournament, going one round further than Martina Hingis in 2006 and Serena Williams in 2015.'
b'That is pretty fair tennis company.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThoughts? So many thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, putting both hands to her head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother goal of mine was to make history, and I just did. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tennis remains a brutally competitive individual sport, in which health, confidence and emotional balance can prove precarious, particularly when a young star emerges in a hurry.'
b'For now, Andreescu has won just one round in a Grand Slam singles tournament, when she qualified for this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open after a surprise run to the final in Auckland. But her breakthrough this season does not look like a fluke. She has the varied all-court game and precise, athletic footwork to give purists goose bumps. And her fighting spirit and open personality should speak to a wider audience, too.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is playing with a combination of freedom and fearless determination; I hope she can hold on to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sven Groeneveld, the experienced Dutch coach who has helped Mary Pierce, Ana Ivanovic and, most recently, Maria Sharapova win major titles.'
b'The next hurdle for Andreescu is a big one: eighth-seeded Angelique Kerber, a former No. 1 and three-time Grand Slam singles champion, in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the third set against Svitolina, I told myself, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick to my tactics and just go for it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Andreescu said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I did, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing for the last couple of months. This is my first time actually on the tour playing against such high-level athletes, so I really have nothing to lose, and in the final as well I have nothing to lose. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to go out there and believe in myself because anything is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Andreescu, born to Romanian parents in the Toronto suburb Mississauga, is part of a new wave of gifted Canadian teenagers with flashy games, immigrant families and potential Grand Slam titles in their future.'
b'It includes Denis Shapovalov, the 19-year-old with the leaping, one-handed backhand who is ranked No. 25 in the men\xe2\x80\x99s game, and Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, who turned heads here in Indian Wells by upsetting 10th-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round.'
b'This comes after the Canadian Eugenie Bouchard broke into the top five at age 20 after a phenomenal 2014, including a run to the Wimbledon final. But Bouchard fell back quickly and is ranked 73rd at age 25. Though she has shown signs of resurgence, she is also a cautionary tale after struggling to manage new expectations, albeit with a more limited tennis skill set than Andreescu\xe2\x80\x99s.'
b'Keeping Andreescu grounded as her prospects soar is her team\xe2\x80\x99s goal, and her own goal, too.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get distracted,\xe2\x80\x9d said her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, the head of women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis at Tennis Canada. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be part of my work to make sure she stays in the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Andreescu does her part by spending 15 minutes each morning doing what she calls \xe2\x80\x9ccreative visualization\xe2\x80\x9d: imagining herself experiencing the situations she will face on court and off so she will be better equipped to manage them if and when they come. Many elite athletes rely on visualization, including the world\xe2\x80\x99s best women\xe2\x80\x99s Alpine skier, Mikaela Shiffrin.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI used to do hours and hours of it, but I found that 15 minutes has really helped me, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not time-consuming at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Andreescu said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I got online from a course. My mom introduced it to me when I was 13, and I have been doing it ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Andreescu\xe2\x80\x99s parents moved to Canada in 1994. Her mother, Maria, has a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in economics; her father, Nicu, is a mechanical engineer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe arrived in Canada with two suitcases, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicu Andreescu told The Globe and Mail. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a great first impression when we arrived, having come from a former communist country. We wanted to go to Canada and start a new life and have a better future for any kids we might have.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Bianca is their only child, and though she developed her game under the umbrella of Tennis Canada, the sport\xe2\x80\x99s governing body there, she said she took her first tennis lesson at age 7 in Romania, where her mother had moved back temporarily for a business opportunity.'
b'That lesson was on clay (bring on Roland Garros), and though her family was soon reunited in Canada, Andreescu has retained strong ties to Romania. Simona Halep, the Romanian star, was one of her two main tennis role models along with Kim Clijsters.'
b'Andreescu speaks Romanian with her parents and attributes her combativeness on court to her \xe2\x80\x9cRomanian roots.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think we are very passionate, and we leave it all out there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all heart.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She has shown plenty of grit in Indian Wells, rallying in the first round to beat the Romanian player Irina-Camelia Begu, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3, on the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s second biggest show court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI actually thought I was going to lose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was really nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She experienced back pain in that match, which has been a recurring problem and was still troubling her late Friday night as she repeatedly shifted position in her chair during an interview after the duel with Svitolina.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have a lot of weakness in my core, so that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely something I\xe2\x80\x99m improving on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andreescu, who has also missed significant court time with a stress fracture in her foot.'
b'On Friday against Svitolina, she had to fight through leg cramps in the final set, in which she managed to convert her fourth match point \xe2\x80\x94 mixing drop shots with big, bold groundstrokes as she constructed points down the stretch.'
b'Though tennis stars are trending taller, Andreescu is 5-foot-7. But she has powerful legs that help her generate tremendous pace when she needs it with both her midcourt forehand and her two-handed backhand and to leap high off the ground when serving. Her second serve, unlike for many players of her size, is not a weakness.'
b'Though she has abundant power and world-class mobility, what separates her from the pack is her ability to change pace. She can lob and generate acute angles with off-speed groundstrokes. She looks comfortable attacking the net and has a solid overhead, which she had to prove repeatedly against Svitolina, a premier defender.'
b'Andreescu fearlessly uses the whole canvas.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of the description. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one has ever said that about my game before, but that definitely describes it, I think. I like to hit every shot in the book.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She is now 2-0 against top-10 players after upsetting Caroline Wozniacki in January in Auckland, where she also defeated Venus Williams.'
b'The victory over Williams moved her to tears. \xe2\x80\x9cVenus is a walking, living, breathing legend,\xe2\x80\x9d Andreescu said.'
b'But though the emotions were powerful again on Friday night, beating her tour elders is fast becoming a habit. Andreescu will be ranked in the top 35 on Monday and will break into the top 25 if she defeats Kerber. Instead of merely making it into the French Open draw, she now has a fine chance of being seeded.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe that I deserve to be here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sotto voce as the interview ended. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect for it to come so quickly. But I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s better sooner than later, right? So I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain. It\xe2\x80\x99s just been crazy. I\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful. I never want to take anything for granted. It was so nice to meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Another season of Grand Slam tennis begins at the Australian Open on Monday, but Agnieszka Radwanska, who retired in November, won\xe2\x80\x99t be part of it.'
b'Aptly called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ninja\xe2\x80\x9d for her ability to inflict out-of-nowhere pain on the opposition from all manner of contortionist positions, Radwanska\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular, poker-faced shotmaking will be missed.'
b'But even without its Ninja, the women\xe2\x80\x99s game is in a memorable phase when it comes to entertainment value and players with an uncommon touch.'
b'At the moment and probably not for long, the tour is a clash of generations with Serena Williams, 37, and Venus Williams, 38, still in the mix along with midcareer champions like Angelique Kerber, 30, and Caroline Wozniacki, 28, and the new wave led by Naomi Osaka, 21, the Japanese sensation who upset Serena Williams to win the United States Open last year. It is rare to see such a range of players clashing with the outcomes so uncertain.'
b'The tour has geographical breadth with players from the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia all in the top 20 and with Ons Jabeur, 24, of Tunisia in the top 60 after last year, becoming the first Arab woman to reach a WTA final.'
b'But there is another strong and too often undervalued selling point: stylistic variety. Though serious baseline power remains the most popular and fail-safe route to stardom, players with subtler, more creative games are also finding a way to win consistently, just as Radwanska, a former world No. 2 and Wimbledon finalist, did before her injuries.'
b'Several of these tennis \xe2\x80\x9cartists\xe2\x80\x9d will be seeded at the Australian Open: No. 10 Daria Kasatkina of Russia, No. 13 Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, No. 15 Ashleigh Barty of Australia, and No. 28 Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan, a 33-year-old whose double-handed, frequently off-speed strokes are as crafty as they come. There is also Jabeur, still an outsider but whose game is a crowd-pleasing mix of baseline punch, feathery touch and Federer-esque flourishes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere will always be exceptions to the power players,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul McNamee, the former Australian men\xe2\x80\x99s star who advises Hsieh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe players you refer to, however, all have one thing in common: exceptional hands. They have amazing touch, and this is why they can survive even if they have less raw power.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That hardly means they have none. Barty, despite being 5-foot-5 and shorter than most of her rivals, generates the leg drive and racket-head speed to hit big serves and forehands. Her crisply sliced backhand has unusual bite, and she has perhaps the best net game in the sport.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe plan to get to the net more often is a focus for 2019,\xe2\x80\x9d said Craig Tyzzer, her coach. \xe2\x80\x9cAsh certainly benefits from playing more doubles than most of the other singles girls, but her volley skills were certainly developed from an early age, which is a massive advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kasatkina has a heavy topspin forehand that she can flatten out to create more pace when she requires it.'
b'But what distinguishes the members of the WTA\xe2\x80\x99s creative class from their peers is the size of their tool set and the range of their tactical options. Their success has meant more matchups that feature contrasting styles: important to the appeal of a game where patterns have a tendency to repeat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTennis is a game of chess, of tactics,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philippe Dehaes, Kasatkina\xe2\x80\x99s coach, who has emerged as one of the tour\xe2\x80\x99s leading mentors and motivators. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to vary zones and trajectories and find the answer suited to what your opponent is doing. To have women who play well tactically and who can keep the ball in play, while varying and creating, makes the show much more interesting for people, in my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is not the contrast that tennis once regularly offered. When Martina Navratilova was attacking the net in the 1970s and 1980s against her baseline-hugging archrival Chris Evert and others, the gulf between styles and tennis philosophies was much wider.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you had serve-and-volleyers going against baseliners, that was more of a complete and obvious contrast,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tracy Austin, the precocious champion who faced Navratilova frequently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in this day and age where the game has become homogenized, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for any contrast. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as extreme as it used to be, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why Hsieh Su-wei is fun to watch, because you feel like you can see the wheels turning in her mind as to where to place the ball, the geometry of the court. So many players use left and right, and she uses north and south as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hsieh is constantly changing depth: shifting her target from the backcourt to the forecourt as she mixes in drop shots, angled volleys and sliced and flat groundstrokes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHer hands can redirect a shot in either direction on both wings with pinpoint accuracy,\xe2\x80\x9d McNamee said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not normal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But outlier fast-twitch defensive skills are required to thrive in an era of abundant power and athleticism, of taller, stronger opposition with superior leverage like Petra Kvitova, Garbine Muguruza, Karolina Pliskova, Madison Keys and the ascendant Aryna Sabalenka.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI try to do something else than the normal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sevastova, a U.S. Open semifinalist last year whose trademark is the drop shot. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, and it\xe2\x80\x99s my style. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I don\xe2\x80\x99t have power. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have that much. But I can handle their pace and hit the ball quickly, and I like variety.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dehaes sees more women being able to survive the onslaught.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that has always been the case, but in the last few years we saw it a bit less,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the equipment played a big role, and there was the evolution of women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis with players becoming stronger physically and better technically. Because everyone trains a lot and everyone trains well, which was not always the case in former times. So with more athletic players and more high-performance equipment, the pace of the game accelerated. But I think now the girls are getting used to it and are more able to counter the games of these super-powerful players.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tennis\xe2\x80\x99s recent honor roll confirms that. Three of the four Grand Slam singles titles last year went to counterpunchers: the No. 1 player, Simona Halep, and Kerber and Wozniacki, all of whom have long had speed and defensive skills, but who also have focused on improving their serves and learning to embrace risk selectively.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, it could be just 15 percent more aggression that can make the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are just robbing your opponent of a little bit of time on certain shots.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Martin Blackman, general manager of player development at the United States Tennis Association, says he believes that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will see more and more complete players on the women\xe2\x80\x99s side.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Purer power players are also trying to broaden their range. In her late teens, Osaka clearly had potent groundstrokes and a penetrating serve. But she did not make the leap to Grand Slam champion until she lost weight in 2018 and improved her explosive movement, agility and defensive skills with help from her new coach, Sascha Bajin, and her fitness coach, Abdul Sillah.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s pulled back some; Sascha\xe2\x80\x99s got her thinking more on the court rather than just see ball, hit ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, she\xe2\x80\x99s fit enough and aware enough and realizes, \xe2\x80\x98O.K., this is a red-light ball. I have to get the point back to neutral.\xe2\x80\x99 Or \xe2\x80\x98this is a green-light ball, and I can go big.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The artists are also at work on finding the time to use their brushes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy challenge with Dasha,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dehaes, using Kasatkina\xe2\x80\x99s nickname, \xe2\x80\x9cis to help her find a way to stay in the rally even under great pressure, and at a certain moment, the right moment, make the difference with a variation. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to vary when you play someone like Sabalenka, who hits every ball very hard from everywhere without much theory. It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to counter this kind of woman.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Perhaps impossible when a true power player is on target.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have Serena and she\xe2\x80\x99s at the top of her game, I still say that power is always going to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Sabalenka is 10 to 15 percent away from that top level or maybe just two weeks away, but when she\xe2\x80\x99s all cylinders firing, I still think she\xe2\x80\x99s going to take out the Kasatkinas, the Sevastovas, the Bartys. But let me tell you. If you\xe2\x80\x99re off a little bit and your timing is messed up a little bit by those combinations \xe2\x80\x94 topspin, slice, short, deep \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole new ballgame.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 After bowing out of the Australian Open this week, Jack Sock and his childhood friend and doubles partner, Jackson Withrow, ended up on opposite sides of a great divide.'
b'Withrow\xe2\x80\x99s childhood dream was to play professional tennis; doubles proved to be his only portal.'
b'Sock, the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-ranked doubles player, has an Olympic gold medal from 2016 that he won in the mixed event, which led to his being honored at a University of Nebraska football game and throwing a ceremonial first pitch at a Kansas City Royals baseball game.'
b'In addition, he shares four Grand Slam titles, three in doubles and the other in mixed.'
b'Sock, 26, has also climbed as high as No. 8 in singles, which is where he stood last year at this time. His ranking since has tumbled to 105, but singles remains No. 1 in his heart.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can personally say if I\xe2\x80\x99m not relevant in the singles world and my only choice is to play doubles, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably stop playing tennis,\xe2\x80\x9d Sock said.'
b'Doubles is supposed to be the harmonic expression of tennis, but at the Australian Open, the doubles court has become the receptacle for petty grievances and philosophical divergences. It started with Bernard Tomic accusing his countryman and Davis Cup captain, Lleyton Hewitt, of a litany of leadership failures, including writing himself into the lineup for Davis Cup.'
b'Then Dan Evans, the 189th-ranked singles player, fanned the flames in his native Britain by describing doubles players as athletes \xe2\x80\x9cwho didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it at singles and people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the attitude to work hard enough to make it in the singles game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Jamie Murray, ranked seventh in doubles, dismissed Evans\xe2\x80\x99s comments as \xe2\x80\x9clazy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cjust total nonsense\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be celebrating any success we have in the sport \xe2\x80\x94 doubles, mixed doubles, wheelchairs, whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Australian Open is called the Happy Slam, but the crankiness quotient at this one has been high \xe2\x80\x94 as if everybody woke up on the wrong side of 2019. The men\xe2\x80\x99s tour appears to be a house divided over the future of the ATP president and chief executive, Chris Kermode, who some believe should be removed from office. The women have complained that the men do not support gender equity. The men fell in line behind an exasperated Rafael Nadal, who said at a news conference, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you are trying all the time to create these kinds of stories on this thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On Wednesday, the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s 10th day, there was harmony, at least in the stands of Rod Laver Arena. During a changeover in the Australian Samantha Stosur\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal victory with Zhang Shuai against Barbora Strycova and Marketa Vondrousova, the Village People blared from the speakers and even the chair umpire got in the act of forming the letters in Y.M.C.A.'
b'By the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s stretch run, all of Australia was celebrating doubles since the men\xe2\x80\x99s, women\xe2\x80\x99s, mixed and wheelchair finals included at least one native son or daughter. (An Australian hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won a singles title here since 1978.) But no amount of success will sway Sock to embrace doubles exclusively.'
b'Sock, who played most of last year with Mike Bryan because Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s twin, Bob, was nursing a hip injury, won two majors and about $1.3 million playing doubles and $738,747 while compiling a 9-21 record in singles. He finished 17th over all in ATP prize money despite ranking outside the top 100 in singles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just singles that you can make a career from in tennis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Murray, who has six Grand Slam titles to his brother Andy\xe2\x80\x99s three in singles. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for a lot of young kids to know that growing up. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to make it in the tennis world. There are only a few people that can make a really good living from the game. The journey is incredibly long. However you get there, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s singles or doubles or whatever, there\xe2\x80\x99s options there for you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'With four career singles titles, including three in 2017, Sock would appear to have more options than most. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it that way.'
b'Ryan Harrison, who teamed with Sam Querrey to beat Sock and Withrow in the round of 16 this week, said: \xe2\x80\x9cJack doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel discredited for his singles ability because of his dominance in doubles. And a lot of time his success in doubles overshadows him as a top-10 singles player. He\xe2\x80\x99s going, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been 8 in the world in singles, and people are talking about me like a doubles guy.\xe2\x80\x99 That perception is always going to be difficult for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As long as the stigma persists that doubles players are lesser than singles players, the Socks of the sport are going to have a strong incentive to stick to singles. Harrison said he has tried to appeal to Sock\xe2\x80\x99s vanity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told him it\xe2\x80\x99d give him more confidence in singles if he took more pride in literally being the most dominant doubles player,\xe2\x80\x9d Harrison said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s being viewed as someone not capable of playing singles.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mike Bryan said he hated to hear Sock would sooner leave the sport than stick to doubles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he gets out on the doubles court, he has a blast,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd because of doubles, he\xe2\x80\x99s played in some of the biggest stadiums in the world, he\xe2\x80\x99s won a gold medal, he\xe2\x80\x99s been honored at a Nebraska football game. What\xe2\x80\x99s the harm in all of that?\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'DELRAY BEACH, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Before the start of every tennis match now, Stevie Johnson walks to the back of the court and squats down for a moment or two. Sometimes he says a little prayer. Often he gives himself an abbreviated pep talk.'
b'Almost always he thinks of doing things the way his father wanted him to.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI really just say a couple of words to myself to help me put everything in perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnson, 29, whose father, Steve, died of a heart attack at 58 nearly two years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell myself to do things the right way and to treat people with respect. And I remind myself that tennis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t define me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Johnson has had a hard time keeping tennis, and life, in perspective since May 2017, when his mother reached him by phone just as he was about to board a plane to Rome for the Italian Open and told him that his father had failed to wake up that morning.'
b'Not only had his father taught Stevie how to play the game, he also sat in the stands for college matches at Southern California and for pro matches at Wimbledon and the United States Open. He witnessed his son\xe2\x80\x99s first ATP pro titles in Nottingham, England, in 2016 and in Houston just weeks before his death.'
b'Entering the Delray Beach Open, which began on Feb. 16, Johnson had not won a match since squandering a two-sets-to-one lead against ninth-seeded Dominic Thiem in the second round of last year\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Open.'
b'Johnson had lost nine straight matches, including one against Borna Coric in the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 Davis Cup semifinal loss to Croatia in September. He fell in the first round at last week\xe2\x80\x99s New York Open to 154th-ranked Brayden Schnur, even though he served for the match and held two match points (Schnur was the eventual tournament runner-up). After that loss, Johnson was despondent in the locker room.'
b'When Johnson, seeded fourth in Delray, won his first match on Tuesday over a longtime friend and Southern California neighbor, 131st-ranked Jason Jung, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just glad to get the monkey off my back and not lose 10 straight.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He followed that with a win over Paolo Lorenzi of Italy on Thursday but then lost in the quarterfinals to 82nd-ranked Radu Albot of Moldova, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5). In that match, Johnson raced to a 5-0 lead in only 18 minutes, and then to a 6-1, 3-1 lead before Albot reeled off 12 of the next 15 points and five consecutive games. Johnson was two points from winning the match late in the third set, but Albot sneaked to the net for a backhand stab volley, and Johnson then hit a forehand wide on match point.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating. I was up a set and a break, and I got tight. Thought I was on a good path, and then this. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way life\xe2\x80\x99s been going for me these days.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Despite his five-month losing streak, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s ranking should stay near his current No. 34. He is the third-best American, behind No. 9 John Isner and No. 29 Frances Tiafoe, the defending Delray Beach champion, who lost in the first round here this year.'
b'Losing has been a bitter pill, especially because he came so close to upsetting Thiem. But a rolled ankle midway through the second set contributed to the 3-hour-34-minute loss.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even played after the U.S. Open,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any tennis left in me. Just all the traveling, from New York to L.A. to Croatia, back to L.A., then Asia and Europe. The way the schedule is, you feel like you need to play all the time, and I got into that trap. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have to do when you play tennis; you have to earn it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not an N.F.L. player who signs a lucrative four-year deal and then can take five months off, have a bad slump and then turn it around. Every week you have to prove yourself. If you have a bad six months, you can go from No. 8 in the world to No. 78, or worse.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Johnson has been transparent about how difficult life has been since his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. He often looks to his players\xe2\x80\x99 box, only to see a glaring vacuum where his father used to sit. There are days when he still can\xe2\x80\x99t bring himself to leave the house.'
b'After a third-round loss to the eventual runner-up Marin Cilic at Wimbledon in 2017, he was so physically and emotionally spent that he developed a fever that lingered and landed him in the hospital. And after a three-set loss in the first round of the 2018 New York Open, he felt as if the ground was spinning, and he experienced shortness of breath that was attributed to anxiety.'
b'That experience led Johnson to seek advice from Mardy Fish, a former top-10 player whose career was marked by bouts of anxiety. At the urging of his mother, Michelle, Johnson also sought help from a psychologist, someone he continues to see whenever he is home in Redondo Beach, Calif.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cStevie\xe2\x80\x99s mom has been instrumental to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Kendall, a former U.S.C. volleyball player who has been with him for almost seven years. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s paved the way with her own recovery and helps him put things into perspective. Even through his grieving, Stevie knows his father wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to struggle and that he would want him to keep playing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Craig Boynton, who has coached Johnson through much of his professional career, said he understood the danger of being sucked down a losing-run rabbit hole.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe funny thing about streaks is that when they snowball the right way, you stop thinking and have great clarity in your execution of your shots,\xe2\x80\x9d Boynton said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when the streak is going the wrong way, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency to overthink and doubt yourself. That takes away your focus from your execution. There\xe2\x80\x99s no flow, and it creates drought or a rut, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Stevie\xe2\x80\x99s been going through. One match can change things in either direction.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After two wins in Delray Beach, there was finally a greater hop in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s step. But it does not mean he no longer has dark thoughts, no longer wonders whether he should even continue to play tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome days it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to fight through and enjoy it,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut those hard days have been outweighing the good days at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to fake the passion,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, choking on his words and using a towel to wipe away tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, my father was such a big part of my tennis life. Tennis is just a weird dynamic for me right now. Every day is different. I mean, he should still be here watching me.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 At 40, Bob Bryan can dive for volleys again. He can turn, twist and slap fast-twitch returns. He can also win more titles: He partnered with his twin brother, Mike, and triumphed at the Delray Beach Open and the Miami Open in the last six weeks.'
b'It is all beginning to feel so familiar that Bob Bryan, one of the greatest doubles players in history, often forgets that he now has a mostly metal right hip.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I take the towel off, and I walk by a mirror, I go: \xe2\x80\x98Whoa! Look at that scar!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a 10-inch scar, and without that scar, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even know it\xe2\x80\x99s in there.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tennis has long produced first-rate comeback tales. It has been 30 years since Thomas Muster, the intense Austrian, whacked groundstrokes in a custom-designed chair designed to protect his postoperative left knee, which was injured when a drunken driver plowed into Muster\xe2\x80\x99s parked vehicle at the tournament in Key Biscayne, Fla.'
b'Muster returned to the tour and reached No. 1.'
b'Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s renaissance at an age when most tennis stars have long since retired is certainly one for the short list, too.'
b'It has been less than a year since he was hobbling down the boardwalk in Santa Cruz, Calif., with his wife, Michelle, certain that his remarkable career was over. He was concerned, above all, about getting healthy enough to play with his three young children.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk for more than five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The orthopedic surgeon Edwin Su resurfaced Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s hip on Aug. 2 at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and explained that, if all went very well, Bryan could envision returning to tournament play eight months later.'
b'He returned to action in five months and, now at the eight-month mark, is winning significant tournaments.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Bob is doing is incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said in a telephone interview on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cHe really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implant.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIncredible\xe2\x80\x9d is quite a word choice from a surgeon who has performed more than 4,000 such procedures. A few others were on professional athletes trying to save their careers, including the former major league pitcher Colby Lewis.'
b'But no professional tennis player has had this procedure and returned to the fore, although Andy Murray, who underwent the same type of operation in January in London after plenty of chatting and texting with Bryan, may try to do the same.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe things that make Bob Bryan great, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you are going to lose that with an artificial joint and surgery,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing to see he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have lost any of it and in fact is now able to play without pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'David Macpherson, the Bryans\xe2\x80\x99 longtime coach, said Bob was playing like the \xe2\x80\x9c30-year-old Bob.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s exploding to poaches like the old days when he would just steal points from incredible cross-court returns by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking off balls,\xe2\x80\x9d Macpherson said in Miami. \xe2\x80\x9cI also feel he\xe2\x80\x99s a little more confident on the return, letting it go and doing more damage than before, and he is still serving just as nasty. So I really feel he\xe2\x80\x99s in a great place right now, where he\xe2\x80\x99s just enjoying his life and loves his family but is getting a second lease on tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Bob\xe2\x80\x99s hip problem became acute in Madrid last May, Mike went on to win Wimbledon and the United States Open with Jack Sock. Bob attended their practices in New York while using a cane. But there was no doubt the twins would reunite on court if Bob could recover.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith all the success Mike was having with Jack in the majors, Bob just handled it all with so much class and was so supportive of Mike in that time,\xe2\x80\x9d MacPherson said.'
b'Doubles has been deeply overshadowed in the modern era, with the biggest stars like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal focusing on singles in Grand Slam tournaments. But in a parched environment, the Bryans \xe2\x80\x94 Mike the right-hander, and Bob the lefty \xe2\x80\x94 have managed to carve out a rich niche with their winning ways and personalities.'
b'They have enthusiastically gone above and beyond to sign just about every autograph and pose for just about every selfie, but Bob is reaching a new audience now.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI talk to probably three or four people a week, people who get my number and call me about hip problems,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA professional soccer player in Australia. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting hit up by people all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He said he had spoken with Murray, the former world No. 1 from Britain, most recently about a week ago.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was asking me a lot of questions in the early weeks, because obviously those are the weeks where you are not feeling great and probably a little concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably feeling really good right now.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray has posted video of himself on social media lightly hitting tennis balls. But returning in singles, with full-court coverage required, is a more daunting prospect.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think a three-out-of-five-set singles match is almost close to 50 times more physical than doubles,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to really challenge Andy, the movement. But I can jump. I can lunge, and I am not sore after matches.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As Murray debated whether to have surgery, Bryan put him in touch with Su, who said Murray was an ideal candidate for the procedure. Murray ultimately chose to have it done closer to home by Sarah Muirhead-Allwood, a leading British hip surgeon..'
b'Can he come back and play singles at the highest level?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think he would be able to,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said.'
b'Hip resurfacing is not a total hip replacement. It calls for shaving a thin layer of damaged bone off the ball of the hip joint and replacing it with a metal cap \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9clike crowning a tooth,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said.'
b'A metal socket is also put in place. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Bob refers to it as his metal hip, it is truly metal,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said.'
b'Bryan credited Su, an avid tennis player, for his success so far.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople tell me this surgery comes down to millimeters,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to people who had different doctors and have done the same procedure, and they feel like crap.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Su said he believed Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool: an anti-gravity treadmill, which supports a player at the hips with an inflatable lower-body compartment and reduces the risks of fractures in the recovery phase.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can un-weight the body to 60 percent to 70 or 80,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said.'
b'Su saw Bryan compete in the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., last month.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love it, just to see what he\xe2\x80\x99s able to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cringe a little bit when he dives, but he\xe2\x80\x99s done it several times, and no worse for the wear.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Will such acrobatics and the other rigors of professional tennis put Bryan at greater risk of requiring follow-up surgery down the road?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a really good question we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to,\xe2\x80\x9d Su said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough data in terms of how it would hold up to activity such as this. This has been done now for almost two decades, so there are some very active patients out there, and activity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make it wear out. We\xe2\x80\x99re drawing from the experiences of recreational athletes.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Miami title was the Bryans\xe2\x80\x99 118th together on tour. They had once planned on retiring after the 2012 Olympics and were close to retirement at the 2017 Australian Open. But such plans are on hold, even with their 41st birthday looming on April 29.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at Tokyo in 2020,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob said of the next Olympics, while emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cwe never wanted to play until we were 45 or 46.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Skepticism is definitely permitted at this stage.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob said with a chuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, either.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 In a riveting Australian Open women\xe2\x80\x99s final on Saturday, Petra Kvitova tried unsuccessfully to shake Naomi Osaka. Kvitova earned five break points in the first set, which she could not convert, and saved three championship points in the second, which she ultimately was unable to capitalize on.'
b'Osaka refused to fade away. Later, as the Rod Laver Arena crowd celebrated Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s 7-6 (2), 5-7, 6-4 victory, Kvitova looked around to congratulate her opponent \xe2\x80\x94 and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find her anywhere.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Naomi,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said, craning her neck to look behind her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Every little thing Osaka does on the court inexorably draws the eye to her, but take the racket out of her hand and she visibly shrinks from the spotlight. Born in Japan and raised in the United States by a Japanese mother and a Haitian father, she was asked in an interview on Australian television if she was ready to become the face of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYikes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, wincing. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully for their sake they don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'How can they not?'
b'Osaka came into this tournament last year ranked No. 72. When the new world rankings come out on Monday, Osaka, 21, the reigning United States Open champion, will become the first singles player, male or female, from Japan to reach No. 1. The retired Chinese star Li Na might as well have been passing a torch when she presented Osaka with the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup in the on-court trophy presentation.'
b'Li, a two-time major winner, rose to No. 2, behind Serena Williams, shortly after winning the 2014 Australian Open. For five years, no singles player from Asia had climbed higher.'
b'Osaka, the first woman since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to win her first two major titles back to back, does not appear to be going anywhere but forward.'
b'When Osaka defeated Williams in the U.S. Open final in September, she was the eighth different woman since the 2017 Australian Open to win a Grand Slam title. By consolidating her victory in New York with her performance in Melbourne, Osaka demonstrated that she has staying power.'
b'Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Williams, in retrospect, seems to have represented a coronation of sorts, one queen ceding the throne to her successor. That idea got lost in that final\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic finish, when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, warned Williams about a coaching infraction, setting off a chain of events that thrust Williams into the spotlight and Osaka into the shadows.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely she is a great one,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, said of Osaka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the future will bring. But for sure she has probably everything that has to be there to play her best tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kvitova, 28, was the same age that Osaka is now in 2011 when she won her first Wimbledon title. It took her three years to return to a Grand Slam final, and she took the title again at Wimbledon in 2014.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to win it, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kvitova, who spoke of struggling to adjust to increased expectations \xe2\x80\x94 and not just from the public.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking like you have to win every single match because you just won a Grand Slam,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI put a bit more pressure than I should.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka also expects a lot of herself. It is what drove her in the past year to create more spin on her forehand, which produced eight winners in the deciding set on Saturday. She has also worked on the placement, and not just the pace, of her serve, also to great effect; she recorded nine aces in the final to finish the tournament with 59, which was 22 more than the next-highest woman.'
b'And against Kvitova, Osaka was able to corral her emotions after the second set got away from her, which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been her strong suit. She lost in the semifinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane after she worked herself into a fury because she felt it was a match that no major champion should lose.'
b'Rain was in the air in Melbourne Park \xe2\x80\x94 a few drops fell late in the third set, prompting the roof to be closed for the end of the match. But Osaka can create her own weather system, and the storm clouds were gathering between her ears in the second set as Kvitova became more aggressive with her groundstrokes and pushed Osaka deeper behind the baseline.'
b'The power game will be on display in this year\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s U. S. Open final when two of the hardest hitters in the game, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, square off. It will be the first Grand Slam final for Osaka who has burst onto the scene with one of the most powerful forehands in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis.'
b'As the second set wore on, Osaka rubbed her temples, glowered at her racket and, at one point, turned her back on Kvitova and took deep breaths, trying to gather herself. After losing the last four games, Osaka took a bathroom break to regroup before the deciding set, and left the court in tears.'
b'While she was gone, Osaka said, she reminded herself that Kvitova was an excellent player. She told herself she had to expect a hard-fought battle, especially after the long and winding path Kvitova had traveled to get to the final, her first since she sustained a career-threatening injury while fighting off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in late 2016.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t really act entitled,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be playing against one of the best players in the world, to lose a set, suddenly think that I\xe2\x80\x99m so much better than her, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a possibility.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s pep talk to herself was effective. In the third game of the third set, she broke Kvitova. \xe2\x80\x9cI literally just tried to turn off my feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said.'
b'She has won 60 consecutive matches in which she has taken the first set, but don\xe2\x80\x99t ask her to explain how she does it. Talking is not one of her talents, Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike in my day-to-day I might speak like 10 sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Osaka grimaced through the trophy presentation, which she was able to laugh about afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to smile,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told to smile and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was panicking.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka forgot a lot of the reminders she had written down on a sheet of paper \xe2\x80\x94 just in case she won and had to deliver a speech. Osaka is shy but thoughtful; reserved but disarmingly revealing.'
b'Describing the third set, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI just felt kind of hollow, like I was a robot, sort of. I was just executing my orders, like I just did what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been practicing my whole life.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"(Reuters) - Britain's Tara Moore stared the dreaded 'double bagel' in the face as she trailed 0-6 0-5 30-40 to French third seed Jessika Ponchet in this week's ITF World Tour event in Sunderland and could have been excused for wanting the ground to open up."
b'Instead, she produced a great sporting comeback -- recovering to win from a seemingly impossible position.'
b'Languishing at nearly 500 in the WTA rankings, Moore saved the match point with a smash that skimmed the net tape before landing on the line -- then set about clawing her way back into contention before winning 0-6 7-6 6-3.'
b'"Never in doubt" the 26-year-old, who reached the second round of Wimbledon in 2016, said on social media.'
b'Tennis has seen many great comebacks in the past.'
b'Andre Agassi won the 1999 French Open final against Andrei Medvedev after winning only three games in the first two sets.'
b'Before that in 1987 his fellow American Jimmy Connors, aged 34, trailed Swede Mikael Pernfors 6-1 6-1 4-1 at Wimbledon before pulling off a remarkable victory.'
b'This year Czech Karolina Pliskova trailed 5-1 in the final set of her Australian Open quarter-final against Serena Williams, but won the last six games to triumph.'
b"While Moore's snatching of victory from the jaws of defeat perhaps surpasses those, American Lisa Raymond went one better at the 2004 French Open."

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Lucas Pouille, the brightest young star in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis in France, was flickering.'
b'Pouille, 24, reached a career-high ranking of No. 10 in March, but did not win more than two matches consecutively after that, finishing the year with a 14-17 run. Playing without inspiration or belief, he slipped to No. 32 by the end of the season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI lost confidence, and then I was not enjoying so much being on court, being on tour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to play tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He had to find a solution, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to find my joy of being on court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille split with Emmanuel Planque, his coach of six years, in November. Pouille, who had yearned to take a break from the tour but decided to finish the season so he could play in the Davis Cup final, was on his own for eight days. When he did pick up a racket, it was only to play minitennis with friends.'
b'But on the Monday after the Davis Cup final, which France lost to Croatia, he met with his team\xe2\x80\x99s captain-in-waiting, Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo.'
b'Pouille had another offer: Coach him instead.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we were talking to each other, it was this couple hours of talking that really had me thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d Mauresmo said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had me thinking that he\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious, that he wants to do everything in order to be as good as possible. He kind of convinced me with what he was saying, that he was ready to do all the efforts and the hard work that are going with being at the top, with digging deep to be at your best.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stepping away from the Davis Cup position before she even started was not an easy decision for Mauresmo, especially considering the excitement over her appointment as the country\xe2\x80\x99s first female captain. But it was made easier, she said, by the radical changes coming to the competition this season, which will reduce the final rounds to a World Cup-style format played at one site, with three matches of best-of-three sets in each pairing, instead of five matches in a best-of-five format.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the captain\xe2\x80\x99s role will be really reduced,\xe2\x80\x9d Mauresmo, 39, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was interesting for me was all the weeks of preparations, the three days of competition, the best-of-five, building a team throughout a year, and the home-and-away. For me, I grew up watching that. I grew up having the emotions that go with it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have no doubt that it will be a good show, a good competition for the crowd, and they will probably put on a big show or whatever. But as a captain, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that the role was that important.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille said he was encouraged by the belief Mauresmo showed in him when she left such a high-profile opportunity behind.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I wanted to have with me: someone who believes in me, and who believes we can go very far together,\xe2\x80\x9d Pouille said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very happy that she\xe2\x80\x99s part of it now, and we can work together, we can have the best results possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille is the only man in the ATP Tour\xe2\x80\x99s top 100 currently coached by a woman outside his immediate family, but he said Mauresmo\xe2\x80\x99s gender was not a consideration in his decision to hire her.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it\xe2\x80\x99s a man, woman, grandfather, grandmother \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as they know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. In women\xe2\x80\x99s sports or men\xe2\x80\x99s sports, in the end you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the same stuff on the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMentally, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same stuff. Technically, she knows tennis. She knows what I need to do on the court to be better. For me, that\xe2\x80\x99s what is important.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille\xe2\x80\x99s choice of Mauresmo was the second high-profile hiring of a female coach in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis this decade. The first was in 2014, when Andy Murray also hired Mauresmo.'
b'Pouille\xe2\x80\x99s decision generated far less second-guessing than Murray\xe2\x80\x99s, which was met with skepticism from both the news media and fellow players.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe pressure with Andy was tremendous, and the criticism that went with it was huge,\xe2\x80\x9d Mauresmo said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I had a lot to prove, and I knew that every match he would play would be about the job I\xe2\x80\x99d done, or not done, or could do better. That was making it pretty difficult, but pretty challenging as well, and I worked really, really hard.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille said many of the queries that came with his choice were more inane than negative.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people have asked me: \xe2\x80\x98Is it different that she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman? What do you do \xe2\x80\x94 can she come in the locker room?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what is important is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on court, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to get ready for the match, and what happens after the match. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who is in the locker room.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille said that, for now, he appreciated the lack of wasted time in his practice sessions with Mauresmo, and also her drive and willingness to join him in his various fitness and running drills.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see on the court that she\xe2\x80\x99s a champion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way she is on the court, the way she\xe2\x80\x99s committed to it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille is hoping that Mauresmo\xe2\x80\x99s coaching can help him return to the top 10. Over the past three decades, French men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis has packed the sport\xe2\x80\x99s peloton, but it has struggled to catapult anyone into regular championship contention.'
b'Pouille is one of five active Frenchmen who can claim to have made the top 10, joining Richard Gasquet, Gilles Simon, Ga\xc3\xabl Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Together, they have reached only one Grand Slam final in the past decade: when Tsonga finished as the runner-up at the 2008 Australian Open.'
b'Mauresmo says she probably has particular credibility in French tennis as a two-time Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1 player, accomplishments that outshine those of all the country\xe2\x80\x99s other players \xe2\x80\x94 male or female \xe2\x80\x94 in her lifetime. But she is uncertain whether most men would be ready to hire a woman with less than hall-of-fame credentials.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cProbably not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe not, but it will come. Maybe not in the next two, three, five years, but it will come.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Patience also was required as Pouille started his 2019 season. He opened the year by losing all three matches he played at the Hopman Cup, as well as another at the ATP tournament in Sydney. But on Tuesday at the Australian Open, he won his opening match convincingly, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4, over Mikhail Kukushkin.'
b'Though he was relieved by the win, Pouille said his confidence in his choice of coach had never wavered.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take time, coming from a year where it has been quite difficult for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I decided to work with Am\xc3\xa9lie because I trust her.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 There was nothing Stefanos Tsitsipas could do.'
b'He tried pressing forward, only to see Rafael Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s whizzing replies fly beyond his reach.'
b'He tried staying patient, only to find himself being run across the baseline like a jack rabbit with a one-handed backhand.'
b'He tried simply to hang on, hoping against hope that his legendary opponent would grant an opening, a reprieve, a string of games, maybe a set. Nadal did no such thing.'
b'On Thursday night, Nadal once again provided every hard-hitting answer in a match at this tournament against an upstart opponent. This time he pummeled Tsitsipas, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, moving with brutal efficiency into his fifth Australian Open final.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am playing well today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when it was over, assessing the match with a bland understatement.'
b'His inexperienced opponent offered a fuller, more exacting description. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt,\xe2\x80\x9d Tsitsipas said, \xe2\x80\x9clike a different dimension of tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'[The women\xe2\x80\x99s final is set: Petra Kvitova will face Naomi Osaka.]'
b'On Sunday \xe2\x80\x94 having not lost a single set all tournament and looking in as fine a form on hardcourts as he has in his career \xe2\x80\x94 Nadal will play for a second title at Melbourne Park, 10 years after his first.'
b'He will face the winner of Friday\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal between top-seeded Novak Djokovic, Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s longtime rival, and Lucas Pouille, a 24-year-old Frenchman who has made his own surprisingly deep run in Melbourne. Before this tournament, Pouille had never won a match here in five tries.'
b'Nadal versus Tsitsipas was yet another match at this tournament touted as a battle of generations \xe2\x80\x94 all-time great versus budding YouTube sensation.'
b'Nadal, 32, has won 17 major championships and was playing his 30th Grand Slam semifinal.'
b'Tsitsipas, 20, has just a single tour title. Though he enthralled crowds and flashed his talent throughout the tournament \xe2\x80\x94 including an upset of the two-time defending champion Roger Federer \xe2\x80\x94 he is still relatively new to pro tennis. He had never previously advanced past the fourth round of a major.'
b'Despite the chasm in experience, it seemed Tsitsipas was playing well enough to have a chance.'
b'Instead, it was never close. Nadal came out sharply, targeting lethal, down-the-line groundstrokes to seize momentum with a break in the third game. From that moment, his power suffocated the young Greek.'
b'As much as Tsitsipas tried to inflict damage with flat returns, Nadal rarely seemed rushed. He was never broken. The first set was over in 31 pragmatic minutes. The second took 44. The third, another 31. By the standards of professional men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, those sets were sprints.'
b'Not long after the match was done, Tsitsipas, who was seeded 14th, looked dazed at his news conference, lacking any of the optimistic energy he\xe2\x80\x99d exuded after previous matches. On Tuesday, he had explained how he\xe2\x80\x99d learned from losing to Nadal last summer in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. He had remembered coming off the court there feeling he would do much better next time against the Spaniard, because now he had a sense of Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s game, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially on hardcourt.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Two days later, there was no such gumption.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe plays just a different game style than the rest of the players,\xe2\x80\x9d Tsitsipas said, dolefully.'
b'It looked as if he had just been pummeled in a boxing ring.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, talent that no other player has,\xe2\x80\x9d Tsitsipas added. \xe2\x80\x9cHis game style has something that it kind of makes the other half of your brain work more than it usually does. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand, but I cannot find an explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Nadal took to the dais a few minutes later, there was nothing but clipped certainty. His answers, coming in his familiar accented English, were all business, same as his game has been for the past two weeks. He said all the right things about focus and routine and not getting too far ahead of matters. There is a final soon to play. This is no time for idle chatter or expansive thoughts. He was bland in the way that Tom Brady is bland.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have to keep doing the things that I am doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my feeling, just keep playing the way that I am playing and let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Bland, but effective. Ruthlessly so.'
b'Nadal enters Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s match having contested some of the most memorable finals in this tournament\xe2\x80\x99s history, though he has won only one of the four. His only title here came in 2009, when he defeated Federer in five scintillating sets. In 2012, he succumbed to Djokovic after a 5-hour-53-minute marathon, the longest major tournament final on the books. In 2017, he and Federer staged the most recent of their epic major tournament duels, with Federer winning in five sets.'
b'Nadal also reached the 2014 final, but he struggled with a debilitating back injury and lost to Stan Wawrinka.'
b'Seeded second this year, Nadal began the tournament shadowed by questions about how long his body could withstand the rigors of a hardcourt Grand Slam event. He had not played a tour match since the United States Open in September, when he retired from his semifinal against Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery. Then, in the run-up to the Australian Open, he withdrew from a tournament he had been scheduled to play in Brisbane, citing a thigh strain.'
b'Asked if he expected to be back in this form, playing this well, gunning in his tour return for another Grand Slam title, his reply came quick. \xe2\x80\x9cIs not easy to be back after four months, and play the way I am playing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 When Andy Murray announced that he planned to retire from tennis this year because of chronic hip pain, the news generated the expected plaudits and empathy from the rivals who had shared a locker room with him for years.'
b'The most distinct voices in the chorus of praise, however, were female. In interviews and news conferences and on social media over the years, Murray established himself as a champion for equality and for women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. In doing so, he became an ally to the WTA tour, whose players have long felt unappreciated and undervalued by many in the men\xe2\x80\x99s side of the sport.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really bummed for him, individually, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also bummed for women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, because we just lost a huge spokesperson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicole Gibbs, a 25-year-old American pro. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be silent in his retirement \xe2\x80\x94 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain really outspoken, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate that. But it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see friendly male tennis player faces throughout the year, so that will be sorely missed for us.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray has said he would like to play until Wimbledon this summer, but after a first-round loss Monday to Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Bautista Agut and now weighing another hip operation, he left open the possibility that he may have played the last match of his career.'
b'In more than a decade as a top-10 player, Murray has used his prominent position to be an advocate for women in tennis in ways large and small. After being taught the game by his mother, Judy, Murray became the most high-profile men\xe2\x80\x99s player to hire a female coach when he added Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo to his team in 2014. He also has made a point of correcting reporters when they omit women from statistics, like at Wimbledon in 2017 when he interrupted a reporter who prefaced a question by saying that Sam Querrey was the first American player to reach the semifinals there since 2009.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMale player,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray interrupted.'
b'Serena Williams, one of the women the reporter had overlooked, praised Murray during a television appearance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman player \xe2\x80\x94 and there really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a female athlete \xe2\x80\x94 that is not totally supportive of Andy Murray,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has spoken up for women\xe2\x80\x99s issues and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, especially in tennis, forever \xe2\x80\x94 and he does it again. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that we love about him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray has not always been comfortable with the praise he receives for what he considers simple gestures, or with the label of \xe2\x80\x9coutspoken.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone out of my way to talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said in August. \xe2\x80\x9cIf someone has asked me a question, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given my answer. When a male athlete speaks positively about female athletes, it makes a headline \xe2\x80\x94 which is strange, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be the case, but it is.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But more than his public pronouncements, Murray has won over female players by acknowledging and validating them in a way few other male players have. The Swiss player Timea Bacsinszky said that Murray was a rare men\xe2\x80\x99s pro who would greet her and her team around tournaments and show his appreciation for her efforts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember where it was, but he comes to me and he\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, great job three weeks ago, you killed it, you were playing so great in the quarterfinals,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Bacsinszky said of Murray. \xe2\x80\x9cI was like, Wow, the guy is looking at the women\xe2\x80\x99s results as well! He just appreciates good tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray prepared last month for a tournament in Brisbane by hitting with Naomi Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion. Osaka said she rued the news that her new practice partner could be leaving the sport soon.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt really sad because I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really talked to him before Brisbane, right?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we started talking. He was so nice. Like, he\xe2\x80\x99s a super nice person. Now I just feel like I lost \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s not a friend \xe2\x80\x94 but I lost someone that could be a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'His appeal crosses generations. Billie Jean King called Murray a \xe2\x80\x9cchampion on and off the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour greatest impact on the world may be yet to come,\xe2\x80\x9d King wrote on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cYour voice for equality will inspire future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'King, who helped the women\xe2\x80\x99s tour get off the ground in the early 1970s, knows how valuable that kind of support has been, and how rare it still is at times.'
b'In 2016, Novak Djokovic, the current president of the ATP player council, was criticized by Murray and others after he said that, after years of gains by women seeking equal pay at major tournaments, men should continue to agitate for a larger share of the pot at combined events. (Djokovic later backtracked, saying his comments were \xe2\x80\x9cnot the best articulation of my view.\xe2\x80\x9d)'
b'And when Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Stefano Travaglia stepped down from his seat on the 10-player council at the end of last season, the council appointed Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Sergiy Stakhovsky, a well-known lightning rod, to fill it. Stakhovsky has been dismissive of women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis and its players in recent years, ridiculing the concept of equal pay and making homophobic remarks about the women\xe2\x80\x99s tour.'
b'Stakhovsky\xe2\x80\x99s comments have repeatedly drawn Murray\xe2\x80\x99s rebuke, both publicly and privately. But they also have left women\xe2\x80\x99s pros feeling little support from men\xe2\x80\x99s players when debates around equal prize money have flared up, as they do periodically.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot a lot of warmth coming from that side or that perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria Sharapova said.'
b'Andrea Petkovic said allies were crucial to the women\xe2\x80\x99s game as it seeks to maintain the level of equality it has achieved, and as it seeks to close remaining gaps. And that is why she said she would miss Murray as well.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a supporter of women gained notice far beyond the corridors of tennis. Before the 2017 United States Open, he was profiled in Elle Magazine. And last year, when the comedian Sarah Silverman was describing her ideal man in an interview on Ellen DeGeneres\xe2\x80\x99s television show, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI like a masculine man, but he has to be a feminist \xe2\x80\x94 that contrast is very hot to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLike Andy Murray,\xe2\x80\x9d DeGeneres suggested.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh my God, like Andy Murray!\xe2\x80\x9d Silverman exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Emilio Nava stood at the microphone on the court of Rod Laver Arena and smiled broadly.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling again. \xe2\x80\x9cWow.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was hard to know he had just lost. Nava, 17, seeded 13th, saved three championship points and held one of his own before falling, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (12), to top-seeded Lorenzo Musetti of Italy in the Australian Open boys\xe2\x80\x99 singles final on Saturday. (On Friday, Nava lost in the boys\xe2\x80\x99 doubles final.)'
b'Despite the double dose of disappointment, he remained undimmed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means the world to come out here on Rod Laver and play, thank you so much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back, and see you later, thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The foundation of tennis success in Nava\xe2\x80\x99s family can be traced to an undersized court in a small town in Mexico. His grandfather Ernesto Escobedo Sr. fell in love with the sport when he watched a Davis Cup tie in Los Angeles. After moving his large family to Jerez, Mexico, he built a tennis court, or as much of one as he could fit, in the family\xe2\x80\x99s backyard.'
b'X\xc3\xb3chitl Nava, Emilio\xe2\x80\x99s mother, said the little court her father built had its limitations, but also offered boundless opportunities.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn one side of the court, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have room to hit a backhand or forehand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it was a tennis court, but more of a playground where we could hit balls and have fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Their father\xe2\x80\x99s passion for tennis rubbed off on many of his 10 children.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started getting older, everybody went their own ways,\xe2\x80\x9d X\xc3\xb3chitl Nava said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we were always playing tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That court spurred her to a modest professional career \xe2\x80\x94 she reached a high of 284th and represented Mexico in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. But it proved an even stronger trampoline for the next generation: Nava\xe2\x80\x99s reaching two junior Grand Slam finals at this tournament alone is just the latest example.'
b' X\xc3\xb3chitl Nava\xe2\x80\x99s nephew Ernesto Escobedo reached a career-best ATP ranking of No. 68 in 2017. Her oldest son, Eduardo, plays at Wake Forest, the reigning national champion. Her middle son, Diego, plays for Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles.'
b'Emilio Nava first made a splash at the elite junior level by reaching the final of the prestigious Eddie Herr tournament last year. He stays in touch with his tennis-playing cousins and siblings in an active group chat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s everything, really,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the sport. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially when you train every day, it becomes a lifestyle, you know? It becomes every day that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about it \xe2\x80\x94 you try to relax a little bit, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still there. But it\xe2\x80\x99s fun, yeah, yeah, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He now splits his time between California and Alicante, Spain, where he trains at the Juan Carlos Ferrero Equelite Sport Academy. When he is home in Woodland Hills, Calif., he trains across the street at the backyard court of his cousin Jaime\xe2\x80\x99s house.'
b'On Sunday, X\xc3\xb3chitl Nava expressed little disappointment about Emilio\xe2\x80\x99s defeat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing him in the finals, for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just very lucky and fortunate to have Emilio, and to watch him play in a big stadium like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s really unbelievable.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'PERTH, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 When Serena Williams and Roger Federer played against each other for the first time, on Tuesday night at the Hopman Cup, it was the ultimate expression of an event that has brought the best men and best women in tennis together for more than three decades.'
b'But despite the power of seeing Williams and Federer on opposite sides of the net, the future of the Hopman Cup is uncertain, with a new men\xe2\x80\x99s team event set to eclipse it, part of a trend of realignment and reinvention in tennis. Tennis Australia, which manages the Hopman Cup, will next year help organize the ATP Cup, a 10-day tournament that will have men\xe2\x80\x99s teams from 24 countries competing across three Australian cities for ranking points and $15 million in prize money.'
b'With mixed doubles increasingly outstripped in prize money and prestige at Grand Slam events, the Hopman Cup \xe2\x80\x94 with two-person teams from eight countries competing in singles and mixed doubles \xe2\x80\x94 is the lone place to see top men and top women team up besides the Olympics.'
b'Though Federer did not participate in the Hopman Cup through the middle years of his career, he has a long attachment to the event, first coming to Perth as a hitting partner in 1999. He won the tournament with Martina Hingis in 2001 about a month before taking his first title on the ATP Tour. At the next Hopman Cup, he partnered with his future wife, Mirka Vavrinec.'
b'[Read: Roger Federer struggles with Serena Williams\xe2\x80\x99s serve. And vice versa.]'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMen and women, we share a lot of tournaments together, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as when you play each other or share the same court,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I think the players have always enjoyed this event.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Hopman Cup\xe2\x80\x99s distinction as a mixed event stands in contrast to the trend of new team tennis concepts for men only. Tennis Australia has taken an aggressive role in event creation, cofounding the men-only Laver Cup and the ATP Cup in recent years.'
b'That focus on men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis could doom the coed Hopman Cup. The host cities for the ATP Cup have not yet been announced, but the state-of-the-art Perth Arena, where the Hopman Cup has been held since 2013, is a likely choice. Even if Perth is not chosen, it would be difficult to imagine Tennis Australia hosting two competing team events in the same week.'
b'The Hopman Cup remains an oddity in its 31st year, at once a playful exhibition that serves as a relaxing lead-up to the Australian Open and, since 1997, an officially sanctioned International Tennis Federation event.'
b'The tournament has been bankrolled by the Western Australian government\xe2\x80\x99s tourism body, Tourism W.A. Player appearance contracts have included clauses forbidding them from criticizing Perth, and at times the programming can feel like an infomercial for the region. After his first match at this year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament, Federer gave an on-court interview that centered on his appreciation for the region and a photo shoot at a scenic rock formation nearby.'
b'Among locals, the main concern is less about preserving the Hopman Cup and more about making sure that isolated Perth, which is 1,300 miles from another city of more than 100,000 people, keeps a foothold in tennis and is not left out of the pre-Australian Open swing.'
b'In the wider tennis community, the Hopman Cup\xe2\x80\x99s uniqueness is appreciated. It has rarely sparked the tribal passions on which Davis Cup prides itself, but the Hopman Cup has been a crowd-pleasing event, cherished by tennis fans who have savored the opportunity to see the sport\xe2\x80\x99s top women and top men compete and commingle.'
b'The New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day battle of Williams and Frances Tiafoe against Federer and Belinda Bencic represented an apex of many captivating Hopman Cup combinations. Marat Safin and Dinara Safina, the only brother-sister pair to both reach the No. 1 ranking, played together for Russia in 2009. Boris Becker and Steffi Graf played together in 1992 for the only time in their careers, a pairing of stars so sought after that a German television station helped the tournament organizers pay the players\xe2\x80\x99 appearance fees.'
b'The tournament has also featured some irresistible matchups of men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s stars who would never otherwise intersect. In the 2011 final, the 5-foot-5 Justine Henin tried to return the booming serve of the 6-foot-10 John Isner.'
b'Not everyone is ready to write an obituary for the event, though. David Haggerty, president of the I.T.F., which sanctions the Hopman Cup as its official mixed team competition, said the event was \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very important and should continue.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Haggerty said he expected Tennis Australia to honor its remaining contractual obligations for managing the Hopman Cup in the first week of the season, which run through 2022.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just excited to continue to see Hopman Cup through because it is a great way to have the men and women playing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haggerty, who spearheaded a massive overhaul of the Davis Cup format last year despite strong resistance from governing bodies, including Tennis Australia.'
b'If Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s final was the event\xe2\x80\x99s last gasp, it had a breathtaking finish, with Federer and Bencic prevailing in an 18-shot rally on a winner-take-all final point against Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, clinching a second straight title for the Swiss pair.'
b'Tennis Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Kilderry, who serves as the Hopman Cup\xe2\x80\x99s tournament director, declined to comment for this article, citing uncertainty about the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s future.'
b'As Haggerty expressed reason for the Hopman Cup to endure, Ross Hutchins, the ATP vice president for player relations, was scouting Perth Arena as a potential venue for the ATP Cup, for which he will be managing director. Hutchins is also visiting Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney, which all have existing tennis facilities.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUltimately we thought this time of year, leading into a Grand Slam, is important to do something major in, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we will target,\xe2\x80\x9d Hutchins said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis event will be a major event on the ATP Tour.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The ATP Cup is landing in a jam-packed first week of the tennis season, which this year has seven tournaments: the Hopman Cup; WTA tournaments in Auckland, New Zealand, and Shenzhen, China; ATP tournaments in Doha, Qatar, and Pune, India; and a combined ATP-WTA tournament in Brisbane. Hutchins said only one of the ATP events would remain on the schedule as a complement to the ATP Cup, with no survivor yet designated.'
b'The ATP is eager to add more events that it will own outright. The ATP Cup will be the third new annual men\xe2\x80\x99s team event introduced since 2017. The Federer-backed Laver Cup, which pits a European team against one from the rest of the world, is held in September. The reworked 18-country Davis Cup will culminate in November. Hutchins said he thought there was room for all three to flourish.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a fatigue of team events because it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we think is diluted, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all slightly different,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'But there is nothing quite like the Hopman Cup on the horizon. Without any fixed plans for the event\xe2\x80\x99s end or its continuation, players and organizers at this year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament participated with a mixture of wistfulness and confusion.'
b'In the afterglow of her match with Federer, Williams was caught off-guard by a question about the Hopman Cup\xe2\x80\x99s probable demise. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, really? I never heard that,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be heartbreaking.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 As the tennis world was transfixed on Andy Murray  as he played what may have been the final match of his career last Monday night, another drama was beginning in Interview Room 2 at the Australian Open.'
b'After a first-round loss, Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Bernard Tomic launched the opening volley in an off-court rift between Lleyton Hewitt and some of the top male players in Australian tennis, a conflict that kept heads turning and eyes rolling throughout the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s first week.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to say it honestly: No one likes him anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Tomic said of Hewitt, the country\xe2\x80\x99s most successful men\xe2\x80\x99s player in the past 20 years and the current Davis Cup captain.'
b'Australian men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis was a dominant force in the sport in the 1950s and 1960s, producing players who won 52 of the 80 Grand Slam singles titles in that span. Hewitt arrived on the scene many years later and in the early 2000s, finished two seasons at No. 1 and captured two Grand Slam titles.'
b'But ever since Hewitt fell out of the top tier in 2006, Australia has not had a male Grand Slam singles champion or a top-10 men\xe2\x80\x99s player. Instead, men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis in the country has now become a soap opera, more memorable for its spats than its results on the court.'
b'At this Open, every Australian man fell out of the tournament after just six days. It meant that the host country had failed to have a representative in the second week of men\xe2\x80\x99s singles for the eighth time in the past 13 years. Meanwhile, an Australian woman, 15th-seeded Ashleigh Barty, plays on into the quarterfinals, her mellow and modest manner perhaps making up for the men\xe2\x80\x99s maddening mayhem.'
b'And a lot of that mayhem has to do with Hewitt, who retired with considerable fanfare at the 2016 Australian Open and segued into a new role as the Davis Cup captain. But his debut in that role was dominated by infighting, with Tomic, in a midmatch rant to Hewitt, accusing his teammate Nick Kyrgios of faking an illness. Hewitt, in turn, failed to quell Tomic\xe2\x80\x99s ire.'
b'Last Monday, Tomic accused Hewitt of a litany of misdeeds as Davis Cup captain, including giving preferential treatment to players with whom he had management deals and continuing to play doubles tournaments and in the Davis Cup as well.'
b'Tomic said he and others did not want to play Davis Cup anymore because Hewitt \xe2\x80\x9chas ruined the system.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo away,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally, if he is retired, why is he still in tennis? Why do you play these doubles tournaments?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hewitt entered the men\xe2\x80\x99s doubles events in Brisbane, Sydney and the Australian Open this month.'
b'Rather than defuse the flames, Hewitt fanned them in his own extraordinary news conference after his loss in Melbourne on Thursday night. He accused Tomic of unspecified threats and \xe2\x80\x9cblackmail\xe2\x80\x9d against him and his family, essentially giving up any hope of working with Tomic again.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to set cultural standards for the Davis Cup and representing Australia; he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really been close to those in the last couple of years,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt said.'
b'Hewitt said that Tomic \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t play Davis Cup while I have anything to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d but that his relationship with Kyrgios, another controversy-prone Australian, was \xe2\x80\x9csalvageable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll I want guys to do is to commit to the sport and work hard, to want to play for Australia,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s too much to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tomic, 26, and Kyrgios, 23, were junior Grand Slam champions and undeniable talents whose professional careers have been a mix of bright spots and bad moments, with both players seeming to relish the chance to challenge the idealistic Australian notion as to how a sportsman should conduct himself.'
b'Kyrgios, who also lost in the first round of this tournament, mostly mocked the questions he received about Tomic and Hewitt in his post-match news conference last Tuesday. He did not pick a side.'
b'But it was clear Kyrgios also had soured on Hewitt after he posted a picture on Instagram on Wednesday of Hewitt watching Alex de Minaur, the recent Sydney champion who has become his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, and implying that Hewitt would not be watching any other Australian player.'
b'Hewitt, 37, responded by saying Kyrgios\xe2\x80\x99s post was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the standards we can\xe2\x80\x99t put up with.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust for the culture of Australian tennis moving forward, can\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt added. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good look. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to Nick about it. He understands that. Whether he learns from it, that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On Sunday, Kyrgios posted a photo of himself with de Minaur on Twitter, seeming to clarify that any bad blood is strictly intergenerational.'
b'De Minaur, 19, is currently the highest-ranked Australian man, at No. 29. He has a game built on dazzling defense, with some of the flashiest footwork on tour. Increasingly, he is presented as a golden boy of the sport in contrast to the ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-wells Tomic and Kyrgios. De Minaur is so committed to playing for Australia that he has \xe2\x80\x9c109\xe2\x80\x9d tattooed on his chest because he was the 109th player to represent the country in Davis Cup.'
b'As all of this was playing out, Matt Dwyer, the chief tennis officer of Tennis Australia, got involved, too, issuing a statement on Friday that highlighted de Minaur, Alex Bolt and 19-year-old Alexei Popyrin, all of whom made the third round here, and praising \xe2\x80\x9ceach player\xe2\x80\x99s unwavering passion to compete and their genuine love of the game, all underpinned by the Tennis Australia values of excellence, loyalty, teamwork and humility.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSupport and opportunities will be offered to players who live these values and demonstrate the commitment to maximize their potential, with our ultimate ambition being to develop and foster athletes we can all be proud of,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 the statement added.'
b'The statement did not mention Tomic and Kyrgios.'
b'Other talented Australian boys have fallen short in recent years. Omar Jasika, who won the 2014 United States Open in boys\xe2\x80\x99 singles and doubles, received a two-year ban last year after testing positive for cocaine.'
b'Oliver Anderson, the 2016 Australian Open boys\xe2\x80\x99 singles champion, served a 19-month provisional suspension for match-fixing for deliberately losing a set in a 2017 match.'
b'There has also been recent tragedy: Todd Reid, the 2002 Wimbledon boys\xe2\x80\x99 singles champion, died in October at 34.'
b'Asked if he was uncomfortable with the good-kids-versus-bad-kids narrative that predominates Australian men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, de Minaur demurred.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of stuff that happens off court, but I think at the end of the day what I really want is to be that boring guy that lets his tennis do the talking, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want everyone to know that I\xe2\x80\x99m that kid that\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave it all out there, fight till the end, and just continuously want to improve. If I\xe2\x80\x99m that boring guy in the media, then I\xe2\x80\x99m doing something right.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'De Minaur has been able to stay away from the fray by making his base in Alicante, Spain. After soundly beating de Minaur in the third round, Rafael Nadal said he wished Tomic and Hewitt could learn from de Minaur\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to advertising adversity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill be more normal if they sit and they talk,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than do this thing here in the media.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As Hewitt lurched toward the end of a news conference that John McEnroe described as \xe2\x80\x9cpouring gasoline on the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d he did not deny that there was toxicity in the men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis culture in Australia. But he insisted that there were good stories, too, including John Millman\xe2\x80\x99s upset of Roger Federer at the 2018 United States Open'
b'For Hewitt, the most disappointing part was that the comments of a first-round loser overshadowed other Australian players\xe2\x80\x99 victories.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one clown making a silly comment, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the main news,\xe2\x80\x9d Hewitt said as his packed news conference stretched into its 14th minute.'

b'Difficult as it might be to remember at this time-is-money stage in tennis, the sport once had no tiebreakers.'
b'Long ago, every set had to be won by a two-game margin and theoretically had no finish line. Which meant that at Wimbledon in the first round of the men\xe2\x80\x99s singles in 1969, the great but aging Pancho Gonzales defeated Charlie Pasarell by the score of 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 in a two-day match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes.'
b'The tiebreaker was introduced to Grand Slam tennis the following year at the 1970 United States Open, with red flags being flown courtside whenever a set reached 6-6.'
b'It has taken 49 more years for the major tournaments to reach the awkward phase where all four use different methods to resolve deciding sets in singles.'
b'The red flags are long gone, but the novelty effect is back. The Australian Open, which begins on Monday, will use a best-of-18-point tiebreaker at 6-6 in deciding sets, which are third sets for the women and fifth sets for the men.'
b'Later this year, Wimbledon will introduce a conventional best-of-12-point tiebreaker at 12-12. That will leave the French Open as the only Grand Slam tournament that uses no deciding-set tiebreaker in singles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the International Tennis Federation, the ATP and the Grand Slams should find, more or less, some consistency of the rules for the understanding of the public,\xe2\x80\x9d Guy Forget, the French Open tournament director, said in an interview. Consistency and mutual understanding seem particularly elusive at this fractious stage of the game.'
b'The Grand Slam leaders meet regularly and have usually made a big effort to project unity in the last 30 years as their tournaments have grown and prospered. But they have squabbled much more often lately.'
b'There have been disputes about the possible introduction of in-match coaching, which Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s leadership continues to oppose. There have been disagreements about the new Laver Cup team event, which the Australian Open and U.S. Open are formally backing.'
b'It seems symbolic that, with the Australian Open\xe2\x80\x99s switch from Wilson to Dunlop, each of the four Grand Slam tournaments is using balls manufactured by a different company this year.'
b'Breaking ranks over tiebreakers is the latest sign of the times, even if it hardly seems a major offense.'
b'Other sports also lack consensus. Consider men\xe2\x80\x99s golf, which has four majors of its own and four ways of resolving ties at the top of the leaderboard after 72 holes.'
b'Despite any confusion, fans still seem quite capable of enjoying golf. Tennis fans surely will end up feeling the same even if tiebreakers in their sport are a great deal more common than golf playoffs.'
b'Top tennis players had best remain alert, however.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m O.K. with any format, really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roger Federer, the Swiss superstar who remains a traditionalist on some fronts, including in-match coaching. \xe2\x80\x9cThe funny thing is we have different formats now in four different Slams, so it\xe2\x80\x99s just important to remind yourself when you do get to 6-all in the fifth, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here now? Do you remember which one it is?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For women, that internal dialogue will come at 6-all in the third set even if there has been little concern about the length of Grand Slam women\xe2\x80\x99s matches, which are all best-of-three sets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was enjoying it, because you have to go far, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the score will be at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Angelique Kerber, who lost a taut Australian Open semifinal to Simona Halep last year 6-3, 4-6, 9-7. \xe2\x80\x9cI will miss it, for sure, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s a good or a bad rule change. We will see.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'One wonders what Jimmy Van Alen would think of it all. It was Van Alen, a wealthy American, who pushed for brisker, innovative formats \xe2\x80\x94 including the tiebreaker \xe2\x80\x94 in the 1960s. Van Alen, a former play who died in 1991, was also one of the driving forces in creating the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Van Alen would not have liked the confusion of different ways of concluding matches at the four Grand Slam events,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Flink, an American tennis historian who met Van Alen several times.'
b'Van Alen\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a sudden-death tiebreaker managed to change the game in earnest \xe2\x80\x94 a best-of-nine-point duel with a winner-take-all point at 4-4, which in a decisive set could give both players a match point simultaneously.'
b'This was the tiebreaker the U.S. Open adopted for all sets in 1970 at 6-6 but abandoned in 1975 in favor of the best-of-12-point tiebreaker that had to be won by two and seemed, to the players, less of a lottery. Wimbledon embraced the best-of-12-point tiebreaker in 1971, but chose to use it at 8-8 instead of 6-6.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI guess tennis has always had some inexplicable inconsistencies with formats and scoring systems,\xe2\x80\x9d Flink said.'
b'Wimbledon maintained its scoring system until 1979, when it opted for tiebreakers at 6-6, waiting 40 years before adopting a decisive-set tiebreaker at 12-12 after last year\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal between Kevin Anderson and John Isner (Anderson finally won, 26-24, in the fifth set on Centre Court, disrupting the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s schedule).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know Jimmy Van Alen was dismayed when his original sudden death nine-point tiebreaker was discarded,\xe2\x80\x9d Flink said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have no doubt he would have preferred the Australian Open fifth-set tiebreaker to what Wimbledon is doing. Waiting until 12-12 in the fifth would not have suited him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But for this year at least, the French Open remains the last Grand Slam holdout, a decision Forget said came about because, unlike Wimbledon, the French Open had not had an ultramarathon final set in recent seasons.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not go with the tiebreak for now,\xe2\x80\x9d Forget said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope personally that our sport will adopt new rules in the future as we need to modernize our game a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"(Reuters) - Chilean Christian Garin powered past eighth seed Sam Querrey to make his second ATP Tour final at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston on Saturday."
b"Garin, who beat Querrey 7-6(2) 6-2, will play Casper Ruud in Sunday's final after the Norwegian defeated Colombian qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan 7-5 6-2."
b'Querrey was the last remaining seed but the American could not hold off Garin in the first set and was overwhelmed in the second.'
b'The 22-year-old Chilean was two points from losing the opening set at 5-6, but held serve and cruised through the tiebreak. '
b"Garin remained dominant on serve in the second set, winning 16 of 19 service points as Querrey's forehand failed him."
b'"The conditions today were slow and windy, which is really good for me," Garin told reporters.\xc2\xa0"I was really focused in the second set and I think he was a bit tired in the end, but I\xe2\x80\x99m playing really well."'
b'The Chilean made his first ATP Tour final last month at the Brasil Open and is projected to move inside the top 50 if he wins on Sunday.'
b'Galan came into his semi having just wrapped up his rain-delayed quarter-final against Jordan Thompson. The match resumed in the third set and Galan got the better of the seventh-seeded Australian to win 6-1 4-6 6-4.'
b'He then got off to a fast start against Ruud, who needed a medical timeout after three games to work on his neck.'
b'But Ruud rebounded by winning 11 of the last 13 games, breaking Galan four times en route to the win and sealing his spot in the final.'

b"(Reuters) - Former champion Marcel Granollers used the drop shot to good effect as he surprised fifth-seeded American Taylor Fritz in three sets at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship in Houston on Monday."
b'The 32-year-old Spaniard claimed a 6-2 4-6 6-2 victory over Fritz, the only seeded player in first round action at the River Oaks Country Club.'
b'"Taylor is a player who can hit very hard. He hits very hard from the baseline and I needed to change rhythm," said Granollers, who won the tournament in 2008.'
b'"If I hit good drop shots, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good option against him and I think today it worked."'
b'Granollers reeled off three consecutive games, including a break at 5-2, to claim the opening set.'
b'World number 58 Fritz bounced back in the second, surging ahead after Granollers had tied the set at 4-4.'
b'The deciding set was all Granollers after Fritz, the 2018 semi-finalist, took the opening game.'
b'Granollers won five consecutive games before Fritz held at 5-2.'
b"Earlier, Norway's Casper Ruud made his River Oaks debut by defeating Bolivian Hugo Dellien 7-6(7) 6-4. His father, Christian, won the tournament in 1996 when it was a non-ATP Tour event."
b'Former champion Ivo Karlovic was not as fortunate as Ruud and the 40-year-old Croat, who won in 2007, fell to American Ryan Harrison 6-3 6-4.'
b"Australian Bernard Tomic and Chile's Christian Garin also advanced."
b'Tomic, firing 11 aces, outlasted American Denis Kudla 7-6(8) 7-5 and Garin came from a set down to top Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas 4-6 6-4 6-2.'
b'Top seeded American Steve Johnson is seeking to become the first player to win three consecutive titles in the tournament since Bobby Riggs did in 1936-38.'

b'The 32-year-old Spaniard claimed a 6-2 4-6 6-2 victory over Fritz, the only seeded player in first round action at the River Oaks Country Club.'
b'"Taylor is a player who can hit very hard. He hits very hard from the baseline and I needed to change rhythm," said Granollers, who won the tournament in 2008.'
b'"If I hit good drop shots, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good option against him and I think today it worked."'
b'Granollers reeled off three consecutive games, including a break at 5-2, to claim the opening set.'
b'World number 58 Fritz bounced back in the second, surging ahead after Granollers had tied the set at 4-4.'
b'The deciding set was all Granollers after Fritz, the 2018 semi-finalist, took the opening game.'
b'Granollers won five consecutive games before Fritz held at 5-2.'
b"Earlier, Norway's Casper Ruud made his River Oaks debut by defeating Bolivian Hugo Dellien 7-6(7) 6-4. His father, Christian, won the tournament in 1996 when it was a non-ATP Tour event."
b'Former champion Ivo Karlovic was not as fortunate as Ruud and the 40-year-old Croat, who won in 2007, fell to American Ryan Harrison 6-3 6-4.'
b"Australian Bernard Tomic and Chile's Christian Garin also advanced."
b'Tomic, firing 11 aces, outlasted American Denis Kudla 7-6(8) 7-5 and Garin came from a set down to top Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas 4-6 6-4 6-2.'
b'Top seeded American Steve Johnson is seeking to become the first player to win three consecutive titles in the tournament since Bobby Riggs did in 1936-38.'

b'PERTH, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 After nearly two decades of appearing alongside each other on billboards and in record books, Serena Williams and Roger Federer faced off across a tennis court for the first time on Tuesday.'
b'The incandescent stars, now both 37, finally aligned for the first time by taking part in a mixed doubles match between the United States and Switzerland at the Hopman Cup team event.'
b'On the opening point, Williams pulled Federer wide to his forehand side with a sharply angled volley, then sent a smash toward the opposite corner that he could not reach in time to send back. Long exchanges between the two proved few, however, with each using their serve to effectively neutralize the other.'
b'It did not seem to matter to the crowd of 14,064 in Perth Arena, the highest single-session attendance in the event\xe2\x80\x99s 31-year history, and Williams and Federer clearly delighted in the chance to hit the ball around with each other a couple of weeks before more serious play occurs at the Australian Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said as she joined Federer on court after the match. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m kind of sad it\xe2\x80\x99s over. It was just warming up.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer and his partner, Belinda Bencic, beat Williams and Frances Tiafoe in an abbreviated format match by the score of 4-2, 4-3 (5-3) in 46 minutes.'
b'Despite the initial, promising exchange in the first set, Williams and Federer seemed to settle into more conservative play; in the entire first set, neither Federer nor Williams succeeded in making a single return off the other\xe2\x80\x99s serve.'
b'(There were, technically, two other people on the court as well. Bencic hit a pivotal return winner off Tiafoe\xe2\x80\x99s serve that helped Switzerland take the lead in the first set.)'
b'Federer and Williams both gained more of a foothold on the other\xe2\x80\x99s serve in the second set, which was highlighted by a six-shot exchange of powerful cross-court groundstrokes between the two before Federer won the point by ripping a forehand toward Tiafoe.'
b'Williams and Federer afterward sized each other up.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was nervous returning, because you just don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople talk about her serve so much, and I see why it is such a wonderful serve, because you just can\xe2\x80\x99t read it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t read yours either,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams interjected, laughing.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the same qualities, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYours is a bit better,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, provoking a good-natured eye roll from Williams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was great, great fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer added. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a great champion \xe2\x80\x94 you see how focused and determined she is \xe2\x80\x94 and I love that about her.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams eagerly reciprocated.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, the guy is great, he\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest of all time, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said, drawing applause from the crowd (Williams has said she doubted she could beat Federer in a singles match).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a killer serve,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally, you can\xe2\x80\x99t read it, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest, because you can\xe2\x80\x99t be that great and not have an awesome weapon like that serve.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That Williams\xe2\x80\x99s serve would prove daunting to one of the best men\xe2\x80\x99s players is no surprise, especially one day after she had sent a clean ace past the reach of 6-foot 4-inch Stefanos Tsitsipas in a mixed doubles match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLike I had any chance of returning that one,\xe2\x80\x9d Tsitsipas wrote on Twitter, replying to an image of the serve spinning well beyond his reach.'
b'After Williams insisted that they hold rackets during an on-court selfie, she and Federer walked back to their seats with their arms wrapped around each other, and Federer said his racket was hers to keep.'
b'As she carried it into the players\xe2\x80\x99 area of Perth Arena alongside Tiafoe, Williams stared at the racket with visible wonderment, showing it to her partner and letting him hold it briefly.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was so excited,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally, it was the match of my career. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, just playing someone so great, and someone that you admire so much \xe2\x80\x94 and a match that actually means something. It\xe2\x80\x99s not often that that happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The mixed doubles win gave the tie to Switzerland, who are the defending champions after Federer and Bencic won the competition last year. Switzerland will qualify for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s final if it beats Greece on Thursday in Group B. The United States, which lost to Greece on Monday, can not advance.'
b'Williams, meanwhile, expressed mild disappointment at her play, especially considering her superior doubles pedigree of 16 Grand Slam titles to Federer\xe2\x80\x99s none.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the one that won those doubles Grand Slams, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Williams said she had been tempted to bring her 16-month old daughter, Olympia, to the match. She ultimately decided against that, settling for having an unforgettable story to tell her.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMen and women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis just don\xe2\x80\x99t compete against each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s just really great and special to go against the greatest of all time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After this summit of superstars, Federer could tell his children the same thing.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 The last time Serena Williams came here for the Australian Open, in 2017, the talk swirling around her focused on tennis. Could she capture her 23rd major title and break past Steffi Graf on the list of Grand Slam title winners since the sport went professional?'
b'She did indeed emerge victorious, beating her sister Venus in the final and doing so, she would later reveal to the world, while in the early stages of pregnancy.'
b'On Tuesday, Williams returns to the sunbaked Melbourne courts, with her 16-month-old daughter in tow, bidding for another place in the record books. This time, though, her tennis is nearly an afterthought.'
b'Four months ago, in the final of the United States Open, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s most compelling moments came during angry outbursts against the umpire that won both praise and criticism, propelling an already epochal athlete to the very forefront of debates about sports and gender, race and power.'
b'That flare-up is still being frequently discussed as the Australian Open begins this week, though Williams herself is not expected to speak to reporters before she plays.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSerena has actually expanded her presence in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives,\xe2\x80\x9d Delia Douglas, a Canadian sociologist who studies women in athletics, said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way people talk about her, the way people debate her and what she stands for, is now heightened.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Her tennis is certainly still part of the discussion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know Serena is very dangerous when she\xe2\x80\x99s fit and when she\xe2\x80\x99s healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Evert, the former world No. 1 who is now an analyst for ESPN.'
b'But just as many, if not more, focus on what Williams means.'
b'As Soraya Chemaly, a prominent feminist activist and social critic, explained: She fits perfectly in these times, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen so much of what is happening in our world is related to gender and race and power. And right now, you can see it. Serena is sitting at that nexus, at the very intersection of all these important social conversations.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The powerful combination of her celebrity, the internet and social media amplifies the discussion each year she continues to play, threatening to overshadow the tournaments she plays in.'
b'The last time she played the Australian Open, she was pregnant. Eight months later, she nearly died during childbirth. She named her baby girl Alexis Olympia. Months afterward, she married her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s father, Alexis Ohanian, a co-founder of the popular website Reddit.'
b'Williams, same as ever, did not shy from attention \xe2\x80\x94 or from making a point. She shared her story publicly and said she was experiencing the same troubles faced by many other mothers. In her first Grand Slam tournament after childbirth, the 2018 French Open, she was not in shape, and she withdrew with an injury in the fourth round. She wore a sleek, black, full-body tennis suit. It was part fashion statement, part medical necessity \xe2\x80\x94 it reduced the chances of a recurrence of blood clots she experienced during childbirth.'
b'But the \xe2\x80\x9ccat suit,\xe2\x80\x9d as it came to be called, was so controversial that French tennis officials discussed banning outfits like it from Roland Garros in the future. (As a countermove, the WTA, which governs the women\xe2\x80\x99s tour apart from the Grand Slams, clarified its rules to allow compression garments to be worn without skirts or dresses over them.)'
b'Undeterred, Williams spoke pointedly at Wimbledon about protecting rights of new mothers \xe2\x80\x94 on the tour and in the workplace. She marched through the draw. But, still out of shape, she lost in the final. A few weeks later, she withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Montreal, eventually citing postpartum depression, a condition that afflicts about 15 percent of all mothers but is often dogged by stigma.'
b'Then came the United States Open.'
b'Nobody here in Melbourne has forgotten what happened during the women\xe2\x80\x99s singles final. Carlos Ramos, the umpire, spotted Williams\xe2\x80\x99s coach motioning at her to be more aggressive. Ramos warned about a coaching infraction. Williams shouted with an angry, unyielding insistence that she had done nothing wrong, that she would never cheat.'
b'Nobody has forgotten the smashed racket, the point deducted as a penalty, her continued shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a thief,\xe2\x80\x9d she defiantly yelled at Ramos.'
b'Nor has anybody forgotten the game taken away as another penalty, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that male players often behave badly and get away with it, the booing and the tumult, and finally her surprising loss to Naomi Osaka, a rising star who may threaten her again in this tournament.'
b'Admirers praised Williams for showing courage, for being willing to stand up to a man, for being a black woman ready to argue her point in front of everyone, for enduring long years of racial slights, for engaging boldly nonetheless \xe2\x80\x94 and for never losing any of her fire. (A cartoon with racist imagery lampooning Williams in an Australian newspaper shortly after the U.S. Open was yet another reminder of those slights.)'
b'Critics saw her as unhinged. This had nothing to do with womanhood or being African-American, they said. To them, she had behaved like a spoiled and raving maniac. More than that, they claimed, she had obscured the performance of a lifetime by Osaka, who had played remarkably from the start.'
b'But who could be surprised that Osaka got short shrift? Win or lose, the talk is almost always about Serena.'
b'Chemaly, the social critic, noted how, during a tour for her new book, \xe2\x80\x9cRage Becomes Her,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpeople kept bringing up Serena.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The book urges women to be unafraid of showing rightful anger.'
b'Chemaly said she had been asked: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of Serena Williams?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What does she mean for this moment?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How would you compare what happened at the U.S. Open to Brett Kavanaugh\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and the anger he displayed before a Congressional panel?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople really want to think about what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d Chemaly said.'
b'During 2018, Williams, 37, went without a major title for the first time since 2011 (she skipped the Australian Open in 2018, still recovering from giving birth in September 2017), and she did not play another tournament after the U.S. Open.'
b'But this is a new year. Based on her play during a string of exhibition matches in Perth \xe2\x80\x94 where fans greeted her warmly \xe2\x80\x94 and during practices this week in Melbourne, she looks primed to win again.'
b'If she does, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have achieved yet another milestone: a 24th major singles title, tying the former Australian great Margaret Court, whose Grand Slam championships came in both the amateur and professional eras.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe seems fitter than last year,\xe2\x80\x9d Evert said of Williams. \xe2\x80\x9cThe scary thought, looking at the women \xe2\x80\x94 they have to be thinking at this point, \xe2\x80\x98Gosh, she was 60-70 percent last year, reaching two Grand Slam finals. And now she seems fitter, leaner. She\xe2\x80\x99s moving better. She\xe2\x80\x99s fresher.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'People are talking. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so controversial now, everyone here will be paying close attention to that first match,\xe2\x80\x9d one local fan, Jess Stow, 34, said, echoing a commonly heard sentiment as she walked with her 2-year-old son near the Australian Open grounds a day before play was set to begin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will she end up saying?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But so far Williams hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said much. In Perth, she avoided discussion of the U.S. Open partly by keeping her news briefing to just a few minutes.'
b'She did tell GQ Magazine in November that Ramos, the umpire at the U.S. Open, should have defused the contretemps by telling her about the signals from her coach before punishing her. It would have let her set things straight without the penalty, she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTell me that something\xe2\x80\x99s happening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she would tell her coaching box, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Otherwise, she has held her peace in Melbourne. Her racket may offer her most meaningful reply.'

b"(Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka used her superior serving and punishing groundstrokes to upset top seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 4-6 6-1 and advance to Sunday's final of the Monterrey Open against Garbine Muguruza."
b"In a battle of former world number ones the momentum shifted in the Belarusian's favor early in the third set when Kerber committed two double faults in a careless service game to hand Azarenka a 2-0 lead."
b'Azarenka seized the opportunity, consolidating the break in the next game before cruising to the finish line to reach her first final in more than three years.'
b'"I\'m very pleased with how I played today," she said in an on-court interview on a warm night in northern Mexico.'
b'"It was an important match and to see how I can do under pressure against a top player," she said. '
b'"I haven\'t won many of those in the last couple years so it\'s good that I\'m able to turn it around and pick up my level."'
b'Earlier, second seed Muguruza eased past Slovak Magdalena Rybarikova 6-2 6-3 to book her ticket to the final.'
b'Azarenka came out the victor in her only previous meeting with Spaniard Muguruza, a hard-fought 7-6(6) 7-6(4) win on the hard courts in Miami in 2016.'

b'DELRAY BEACH, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 As Radu Albot became the first player from Moldova to win an ATP title on Sunday, his small home country in Eastern Europe was holding parliamentary elections.'
b'Unlike four years ago, when he was in France for a tennis tournament and spent about $200 on a taxi to the Moldovan Embassy so he could cast a ballot, Albot said he could not make his way to a voting booth on Sunday.'
b'This time, he was busy in the Delray Beach Open final, where he held off Dan Evans to capture the title, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7), and earn $97,490, the biggest payday of his career.'
b'Albot, 29, has been on tour for more than a decade but is only now hitting his stride. Entering the Delray Beach Open he was ranked No. 82 in the world, just off his career high of No. 81, set nearly two years ago. With the win over Evans, in which he saved three match points, Albot moved to a new career high of No. 52.'
b'Albot is the first player, man or woman, from Moldova to be ranked within the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 100. Most have never broken the top 300.'
b'Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of 3.55 million, is better known for producing wine than tennis players. It has, however, had its share of Olympic wrestlers, Nordic skiers and soccer players. Natalia Levchenkova placed eighth in biathlon at the 2006 Winter Olympics.'
b'At the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, 23 Moldovan athletes competed, including Albot, the country\xe2\x80\x99s first Olympic tennis player. He beat Teymuraz Gabashvili of Russia in the first round before losing to Marin Cilic of Croatia. In those Games, one Moldovan, a flat-water canoeist named Oleg Tarnovschi, won the country\xe2\x80\x99s only medal, a bronze that was later stripped because he violated antidoping rules.'
b'The next-highest-ranked male player from Moldova, the 36-year-old Roman Borvanov, reached No. 200 back in 2011. Now a teaching pro near Miami, he was in Albot\xe2\x80\x99s players\xe2\x80\x99 box cheering for his countryman on Sunday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a way, coming from this country, the results I\xe2\x80\x99ve had, it\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle,\xe2\x80\x9d Albot said. Unlike players in countries that host a Grand Slam and have a history of producing star players, he said, he had no Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi in front of him as role models and challenges.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have a goal, you want to be as them,\xe2\x80\x9d Albot said. \xe2\x80\x9cMe, growing up, I had nobody ahead of me except the guy ranked 200. I wanted to be as him, better than him. But as soon as I got to 190, then what? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to go higher. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have someone to ask how to get there, to go to for advice. I had to build my game by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Albot was 6, his father, Vladimir, saw a tennis match on television and decided he wanted his only child to play the sport. Vladimir Albot was able to arrange for his son to train at a school that specialized in tennis \xe2\x80\x94 a government-funded academy near the family\xe2\x80\x99s home in Chisinau, the Moldovan capital. The club has eight outdoor red-clay courts and two indoor courts. Until recently, those courts were made of wooden planks, but they have been converted to a hardcourt surface.'
b'Though his parents were of modest means \xe2\x80\x94 Radu still lives with them in the two-room apartment they own \xe2\x80\x94 Vladimir traveled with Radu to junior tournaments while his mother, Svetlana, stayed home to work in her dental therapy practice. Vladimir sold some property he owned to fund his son\xe2\x80\x99s travel.'
b'Rather than spend money on hotel rooms, the pair would often sleep on mattresses inside gyms connected to the clubs where Radu competed, Albot said. Whenever Radu was offered a chance to share a room with another competitor, his father would pitch a tent for himself in the tournament parking lot.'

b'At 13, Albot was playing in Germany, and he met Jimmy Oganezov, a local businessman from the former Soviet Republic of Georgia who had become a tennis coach. Oganezov invited Albot to spend the summer living and training with him in Wiesbaden. That summer turned into more than a dozen summers, and the training convinced Albot that he could have a career as a professional tennis player.'
b'Moldova\xe2\x80\x99s tennis federation generates little sponsorship money for its players, Albot said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little disappointing because in some countries, like the U.S. and France, they get so much help, like sponsors and wild cards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Albot, who has a German manager and one sponsorship deal, with Yonex for rackets, clothing and shoes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was not the spoiled kid who got millions at 19 years old,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, on the other hand, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Albot had a 12-23 record in tour-level matches last year, including a semifinal finish in Metz, France. This year he has a 10-4 record in five tournaments, including a semifinal finish in Montpellier, France, and the title in Delray Beach. He will next play the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, Calif., and in Miami.'
b'When his playing career is over, Albot would like to return to Moldova and help build the next generation of tennis players. He knows it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.'
b'The country is among the poorest in Europe, and Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s election has not delivered a conclusive result. There have been accusations of fraud that further threaten the country\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to stabilize.'
b'Still, Albot has hope.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to finish my career and see that tennis is dead in my country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to walk into every tournament and see the Moldovan flag flying.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans.'
b'Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross\xe2\x80\x99s Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLarry\xe2\x80\x99s done a great job,\xe2\x80\x9d Ross said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe set the bar high, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all great for tennis. But for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.'
b'That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go.'
b'Rather than see the tournament \xe2\x80\x94 and its hundreds of millions in local revenue \xe2\x80\x94 uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue.'
b'The move wasn\xe2\x80\x99t well received by everyone.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKey Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts \xe2\x80\x94 all permanent \xe2\x80\x94 were built on top of parking lots.'
b'On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s Henman Hill, minus the grass.'
b'The change recalls the United States Open\xe2\x80\x99s move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins\xe2\x80\x99 chief executive. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tournament organizers did not take the word \xe2\x80\x9cluxury\xe2\x80\x9d lightly. The stadium court \xe2\x80\x94 painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue \xe2\x80\x94 seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court.'
b'Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million.'
b'Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Blake, the tournament director.'
b'Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Hudson Yards project. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they\xe2\x80\x99re watching for those details.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.'
b'The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages.'
b'But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG\xe2\x80\x99s parent company. \xe2\x80\x9cKey Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we\xe2\x80\x99re the new U.S. Open.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 By reaching the semifinals of the Miami Open, the Canadian youngsters Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov achieved something that Roger Federer and John Isner never managed.'
b'Federer, for all his obvious and precocious tennis talents, never made it to this late a stage of a Masters 1000 event in singles as a teenager. Isner was still a student-athlete at the University of Georgia in his late teens.'
b'But neither Auger-Aliassime, 18, nor Shapovalov, 19, was able to make the next leap on Friday as Isner and Federer took turns holding back youth on the temporary center court at Hard Rock Stadium.'
b'Federer, 37, and Isner, 33, will now play an old-guard final on Sunday.'
b'On Friday afternoon, Isner was opportunistic in his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4) victory against the silken Auger-Aliassime. In the evening, Federer was brilliant in his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of Shapovalov, a flashy left-hander with a one-handed backhand who grew up idolizing Federer and now has a much clearer understanding of what it is like to face him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just think he has every shot mastered,\xe2\x80\x9d Shapovalov said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he needs a shot, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make it. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to go for it. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to make it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has any weaknesses. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s the G.O.A.T,\xe2\x80\x9d the greatest of all time.'
b'Federer has had more vulnerable moments in his career and even one this month when Dominic Thiem, another younger man with a forceful one-handed backhand, defeated him to win the title in Indian Wells on March 17.'
b'But Federer has been in a very fine patch of form, successfully rebounding from his defeat to yet another member of the new wave, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in the fourth round of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open.'
b'Since then, Federer is 15-1, all on hardcourts.'
b'Auger-Aliassime is already quite a tennis package: explosive from the baseline, comfortable at the net and smooth on the move as well as in the interview room, where he can reflect in French or English.'
b'On Friday, in the biggest match of his career, the Canadian qualifier acted his age only when it came time to close out a set.'
b'Isner, 15 years his senior, has long been one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s supreme servers. But it was Auger-Aliassime\xe2\x80\x99s own serve that proved his undoing.'
b'Up by 5-4 and serving for the first set, Auger-Aliassime produced his first three double faults of the match and lost his edge.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor sure, nerves,\xe2\x80\x9d Auger-Aliassime said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like I caught a virus or something.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Up by 5-3 and serving for the second set, he double faulted and knocked a midcourt forehand swing volley into the tape on break point.'
b'He was soon back in another tiebreaker with Isner, for whom tiebreakers are as natural a habitat as a swamp is to a gator.'
b'Isner has played 49 sets this year. More than half (26) have ended in tiebreakers, a reflection of his phenomenal serve and his limitations as a returner.'
b'Though Isner had a losing record in 2019 tiebreakers before this tournament, he has gone 9-0 in the Miami Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just finding myself pretty calm in those situations; maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit mental,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just definitely playing my best tennis when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in that situation this week. There is no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Isner\xe2\x80\x99s defeat of Auger-Aliassime put him one victory from defending the most significant title of his career. Isner won this Masters 1000 tournament last season, when it was played about 20 miles south of Miami Gardens, on the upscale island of Key Biscayne and with a permanent main stadium.'
b'This year, the tournament moved to the grounds of Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA completely different feel than last year, obviously,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said.'
b'There are clear benefits to the shift in site: more spacious and luxurious facilities for fans and players; a less congested commute; a fine vibe on the outside courts despite complaints about insufficient seating. Above all there is the fact that this event, traditionally one of the most prestigious outside the four Grand Slam events, has remained in the United States and in the tennis hotbed of South Florida rather than being moved outside the country, which has been the case for other United States-based tournaments in the past 20 years.'
b'But the downside for now is that the main stadium often has a low-energy atmosphere, and though ticket sales have been brisk, fewer than half of the seats were occupied when Isner and Auger-Aliassime began play shortly after 1 p.m.'
b'The noise and age gap were more pronounced in the second semifinal. Federer is 37. Shapovalov is 19 and was not even born when Federer played his first main-draw match at the Miami Open in 1999.'
b'Federer mentioned that fun fact before the match to his twin daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, who are 9: closer to Shapovalov\xe2\x80\x99s age than their father.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey were like: \xe2\x80\x98What? Hold on a second!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI did the calculation, and they were like, \xe2\x80\x98So this guy is really young?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer responded by telling them he was \xe2\x80\x9creally old,\xe2\x80\x9d but he certainly did not move like it against Shapovalov, who had practiced with him but never played against him in earnest.'
b'Federer improvised and covered the corners impressively, slashing forehand and backhand winners and hitting deft, precise volleys. The only relative disappointment: a first-serve percentage below 50 percent. But Federer made the most of his first serves, winning 91 percent of the points and avoiding being broken.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think I played very well; I had to,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I think when you let Denis play, he\xe2\x80\x99s got some serious power and he gets the rhythm going and he can really put you in some uncomfortable situations.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So, in a very different vein, can Isner.'

b'Jack Ming Jie Lin, a Columbia tennis player, will miss class on Tuesday. He has a good excuse. '

b'One recent morning, Jack Ming Jie Lin, a Columbia University tennis player, informed his chemistry professor that he needed to reschedule Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s lab because he had another engagement.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said he told his professor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very important match Feb. 12 and I understand that we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to have lab session that Tuesday night, but unfortunately, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it that night.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Instead of chemistry class, Lin, a 19-year-old sophomore, will be playing his first ATP Tour main-draw match, at the New York Open at Nassau Coliseum. Lin earned a wild card into the first round of the professional event by winning a college invitational in November at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Thirty-two players from 16 New York-area universities, including Army, Cornell, Princeton and St. John\xe2\x80\x99s, competed in the tournament, where Lin beat Alafia Ayeni of Cornell, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 7-6 (5), in a final that lasted three and a half hours.'
b'Lin\xe2\x80\x99s appearance at the New York Open is a rare opportunity for an amateur to test himself against the pros.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Knicks can never play a team like St. John\xe2\x80\x99s in a game that actually counts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Lebedevs, the assistant tournament director for the New York Open. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this, it is the pros playing a collegiate player, and it counts for both of them. For a kid like Jack, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to get points and to get started on a potential pro career after his college or during the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A native of Markham, Ontario, Lin ended the fall at No. 4 in the collegiate doubles rankings with his playing partner, William Matheson, and is No. 40 in singles. He helped Columbia reach the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament last season after the Lions won the Ivy League for the fifth year in a row. He owns victories over the current pros Taylor Fritz of the United States and Denis Shapovalov of Canada, but those came in the junior ranks. Shapovalov is ranked No. 25 in the world, and Fritz No. 40.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously seeing them both develop into such big-time players, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m at their level yet with the results that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been having,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lin, who grew up near Shapovalov, 19, in the Toronto suburbs. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just more content with my own improvement over every month.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The New York Open will feature many top American player, including John Isner, Frances Tiafoe, Steve Johnson and Sam Querrey. The former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt is playing doubles, as are Bob and Mike Bryan.'
b'Lin will play a qualifier on Tuesday, and if he wins, he would face Johnson, ranked 34th. Some of Lin\xe2\x80\x99s Columbia teammates want him to face a top player to see how he matches up.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to watch Jack play against one of the high-caliber guys to see the difference between the ATP guys and the level in college,\xe2\x80\x9d said the junior Jackie Tang, who plays for the Hong Kong Davis Cup team in addition to competing for Columbia. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99ll do well because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the gap is that big. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just the experience and the knowledge of how to play certain points correctly.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'John McEnroe, who played a year at Stanford, has been a supporter of college tennis, pointing out that top-10 players like Isner and Kevin Anderson have had pro success at older ages after maturing while playing college tennis. Most recently, Danielle Collins, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion at Virginia, advanced to the semifinals of the Australian Open at 25.'
b'Lin said: \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I think college tennis is the best it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been. There are so many transitional players playing at such a high level.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Lin\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Sally Yi, is set to come from Toronto, and many of Lin\xe2\x80\x99s coaches and teammates plan to root him on as well. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love these play-in formats where it\xe2\x80\x99s not just arbitrarily granting a wild card to somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former American star Andy Roddick, who kicked off the tournament on Saturday with an exhibition match against Jim Courier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good story that somebody came in and earned it and this is what you get for your troubles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s better than being able to work your way into the matches that you dream about?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Roddick joked that he would advise Lin not to take the prize money so that he can remain an amateur. Lin has not planned that far ahead.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, playing the event\xe2\x80\x99s not really about the prize money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just more about getting the opportunity to play in front of everybody on such a big stage and play against the top guys on the ATP level just to assess what my level is.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At 5-foot-11, Lin is short for a sport where more than half of the men\xe2\x80\x99s top-15 players are at least 6-4. But he is a shotmaker and is working on becoming more aggressive by coming to net more.'
b' Lin, who hopes to someday be a top-100 player on the ATP Tour, considers himself part of the rising wave of Canadian players that includes Shapovalov and Felix Auger-Aliassime. He played for Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Davis Cup team, but opted to come to the United States to focus on academics and tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn Canada, there are a lot of great universities there too, but they kind of lack the competition in tennis of playing in the States,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying N.C.A.A. tennis, it allows me to continue developing my game and obviously at the same time pursue my academic goals.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Balancing the two sets of goals has been a battle. The men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis team as a whole carries a 3.74 grade point average, and Lin does not want to let his teammates down.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things going on, but he\xe2\x80\x99s managing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bid Goswami, in his 37th season as the Columbia tennis coach. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be left behind in his studies. He had a really good last two semesters.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As for that chemistry lab, Lin suggested to his professor that he move it to Wednesday night, but if he wins on Tuesday, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make that session, either. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be back on the court playing his second-round match at the New York Open.'
b'In fact, he would have several schedule conflicts to manage. The Columbia team is flying to Chicago on Wednesday for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association national championships, which begin Friday. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Jack wins his first match on Tuesday night and misses our flight to Chicago for national indoors,\xe2\x80\x9d the Columbia assistant Howard Endelman said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a good problem to have.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'TOKYO \xe2\x80\x94 If anyone can stir Japanese national pride at the moment, it is Naomi Osaka.'
b'The world\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1-ranked player in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, Ms. Osaka is among the biggest stars in Japan, splashed across television programs and advertisements for Nissan cars and Citizen watches. As a mixed-race person, she has also helped prompt a discussion about how Japanese see their country.'
b'But a looming deadline \xe2\x80\x94 Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s 22nd birthday in October \xe2\x80\x94 has raised the question of whether she can continue to represent Japan on the international tennis circuit, where she has given the country bragging rights on the world sports stage.'
b'Ms. Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and father is Haitian-American, has citizenship in both Japan and the United States. Under Japanese law, dual citizens must choose between the two nationalities by the time they turn 22.'
b'That legal clause has left fans and commentators trying to guess whether Ms. Osaka will pick citizenship in Japan, the country of her birth, or the United States, where she has lived since she was a young child.'
b'The choice facing Ms. Osaka comes as Japan is under pressure to loosen its entrenched insularity. Japan has long prized racial purity, seeing a largely homogeneous population as crucial to social cohesion. But with the country\xe2\x80\x99s population declining and employers increasingly desperate for workers, its legislature passed a law in December to admit more guest workers, starting this month.'
b'Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s case, along with the new influx of foreigners, could exert new pressure on the government to begin to bring Japanese citizenship laws in line with those in the roughly three-quarters of countries, including the United States, that allow dual citizenship.'
b'For now, though, Ms. Osaka has a decision to make. When asked by reporters which nationality she intended to choose, she responded with trademark feistiness.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at a news conference following the China Open in October. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m playing for Japan. Not to be disrespectful or anything, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get where the conclusion that it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard choice for me or anything comes from.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Still, it might be hard to imagine Ms. Osaka giving up her American citizenship to keep playing under the Japanese flag. And in reality, she may not have to. Legal experts say the Japanese government rarely enforces the law requiring citizens to choose between nationalities.'
b'The Justice Ministry estimates that about 890,000 Japanese citizens may also hold foreign passports, and the government has never revoked Japanese citizenship from anyone who, like Ms. Osaka, was granted citizenship at birth. (Japanese citizens who voluntarily naturalize in another country automatically lose their Japanese citizenship.)'
b'But some analysts warn that because of Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity, it would be difficult for the government to quietly give her a pass on dual citizenship.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think for the government it is a problem if she openly carries on having two passports,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sachiko Horiguchi, associate professor of anthropology at Temple University\xe2\x80\x99s Tokyo campus. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause that means the public would know that the law isn\xe2\x80\x99t really enforced. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the government wants to admit that or the public to know that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Three years ago, when Renho Murata, whose father is from Taiwan, ran as the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, right-wing critics attacked her because she had not formally relinquished her Taiwanese citizenship.'
b'Partly in response to the frenzy over Ms. Murata, Kimi Onoda, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who was born in the United States to an American father and a Japanese mother, formally renounced her American citizenship.'
b'Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s multicultural background has challenged Japan\xe2\x80\x99s notions of national identity, and she has become the most prominent mixed-race and mixed-nationality figure in a country where only one in 50 children born each year has a foreign parent. Though she is not fluent in Japanese, she has captivated the country with her whimsical remarks to the news media, as well as her humility in victory.'
b'Her parents decided when she was young that she and her sister, who also played, would represent Japan, partly because the American tennis federation showed them little attention.'
b'Anticipating Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship choice, Michio Ushioda, a former columnist for The Mainichi Shimbun, a daily newspaper, and a professor at Teikyo University in Tokyo, said on Twitter that Japan would fall into a national funk if she elected American citizenship over Japanese.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe disappointment of the Japanese at that time would be great,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ushioda wrote in a tweet that only select followers could view, even suggesting that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s current administration would collapse if Ms. Osaka competed for the United States in the Olympics.'
b'Under International Olympic Committee rules, competitors must be nationals of the countries they represent. Similarly, under International Tennis Federation rules, Ms. Osaka could not play for Japan if she gave up her Japanese citizenship.'
b'Legal experts say Japanese law provides a loophole through which dual citizens can effectively retain both nationalities. The law requires only that a Japanese citizen \xe2\x80\x9cendeavor to renounce\xe2\x80\x9d foreign nationality, a phrase that can provide just enough wiggle room for citizens to hold on to an extra passport.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany people misunderstand the law and feel threatened that they have to choose a nationality,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yasuhiro Okuda, a law professor at Chuo University.'
b'Until 1985, Japan granted citizenship only to children whose fathers were Japanese. When it changed the law \xe2\x80\x94 a move it made under pressure from international critics who said the rules discriminated against women \xe2\x80\x94 the government added the clause stipulating that children with dual citizenship would have to choose between their passports by the time they turned 22.'
b'Analysts say Japan\xe2\x80\x99s law makes little sense in a modern world filled with multicultural citizens like Ms. Osaka.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes against Japan\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to recruit and retain global talent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Erin Chung, a professor of East Asian politics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you basically maintain the spirit of the current nationality act, that will be a huge deterrent for athletes and other members of what\xe2\x80\x99s called the global talent pool to stay in Japan.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For older generations, opening Japan to a pool of newly naturalized citizens could generate a considerable political backlash.'
b'But younger Japanese are growing more accustomed to living and working with international neighbors and colleagues.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYoung people in their 20s now are much more familiar with foreigners or so-called \xe2\x80\x98hafu,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Satoko Takeda, a visiting researcher at Osaka University of Economics and Law, using the Japanese term, from the English word \xe2\x80\x9chalf,\xe2\x80\x9d to describe those of mixed-race descent like Ms. Osaka. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are different from previous generations. I think there is hope.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 As part of her morning routine, the Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu finds a quiet place and visualizes success, big success.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s crazy to think that it became a reality today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said after the roars had faded on Sunday afternoon.'
b'Not so crazy if you observed all the shots and grit that Andreescu had to summon under duress to defeat tennis elder after tennis elder in the desert and win one of the most prestigious titles in the sport.'
b'But it was certainly far-fetched when you considered her lack of experience at this level and the quality of the players she had to outhit and outwit, including the three-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 Angelique Kerber, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final.'
b'Andreescu, 18, is the first wild card to win the BNP Paribas Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, this moment can be a great inspiration for many young athletes because, like I always say, if you believe in yourself, anything is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Andreescu said during the award ceremony.'
b'While she won her first tour title, Roger Federer was unable to win his 101st, losing to Dominic Thiem, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, in the men\xe2\x80\x99s final later Sunday. Thiem, the No. 7 seed, reached the French Open final last year, but this Masters 1000 title was his most significant victory.'
b'He earned it \xe2\x80\x94 just barely \xe2\x80\x94 by putting his huge baseline power and flashy one-handed backhand to work and by breaking the 37-year-old Federer at 5-5 in the third set and then holding firm.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s not my right to congratulate you; you have 88 more titles than me,\xe2\x80\x9d Thiem said to Federer, who is, nonetheless, now 2-3 against the young Austrian.'
b'Kerber, age 31 and seeded eighth, was unable to prevail against Andreescu despite a huge edge in experience. This was Kerber\xe2\x80\x99s 29th final on tour, and only Andreescu\xe2\x80\x99s second. Kerber had won more than $27 million in career prize money; Andreescu had won just $350,000.'
b'Kerber also had an apparent physical edge in the final phase of a grueling match, played in 80-degree weather. Andreescu arrived on court with her right shoulder and right forearm taped after winning six matches en route to the final.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy shoulder has just been really, really tight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was more for prevention.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She required more treatment on her arm early in the third set, but despite looking bone weary between points, crouching down and stretching repeatedly, she found the will and, above all, the patterns and talent to finish off Kerber on her fourth match point.'
b'When it was over, Kerber kissed the teenager on both cheeks. Andreescu then crossed to the opposite side of the net, kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, her arms and legs splayed as she basked in the sun and in one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s most unexpected great performances.'
b'Though most Canadians at home could not watch the match on terrestrial television \xe2\x80\x94 only streaming was available outside of Quebec \xe2\x80\x94 her compatriots definitely noticed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBianca Andreescu just made history. Congratulations,\xe2\x80\x9d Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, posted on Twitter shortly after her victory.'
b'Women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, which is in a deeply compelling phase, has had a number of breakthrough performances of late, including Naomi Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s run to the title at Indian Wells a year ago as an unseeded player, when she was 20. That presaged Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s victories at the United States Open and the Australian Open and her rise to No. 1, where she remains.'
b'Andreescu was asked if she saw that as inspiration.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered quickly, smiling.'
b'Her questioner apologized.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s totally fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Andreescu said. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely inspiration seeing her claim the trophy last year, and winning two Grand Slams right after that has been amazing to see. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to focus on the future right now. I just want to enjoy this moment, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take anything for granted. You never know what next week brings. I just want to savor this.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Next week will bring the Miami Open, where she has a first-round match scheduled against Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania, the player she had to rally to defeat in the first round in three sets at Indian Wells.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not seeded and won\xe2\x80\x99t get the extra day of rest,\xe2\x80\x9d her coach, Sylvain Bruneau, said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo of course it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge to go right to Miami with very little rest and with the emotions and everything. But it\xe2\x80\x99s like that, and you have to go with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the learning curve and the job.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Andreescu, the only child of Romanian immigrants, is the youngest woman to win at Indian Wells since 17-year-old Serena Williams did so in 1999.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou just played amazing the whole tournament, so you really deserved to win the title here,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerber told Andreescu in her postmatch on-court remarks.'
b'Andreescu did not emerge from obscurity. She was a highly regarded junior player who won the prestigious Les Petits As title in France, and though she was not the dominant junior at the Grand Slam level in 2016 and 2017, she did win two Grand Slam girls doubles titles.'
b'In January, Andreescu upset Caroline Wozniacki, then No. 3 in the world, and Venus Williams to reach the final of the tour event in Auckland, New Zealand, and then qualified for the Australian Open, where she won her first Grand Slam singles match.'
b'But her run in the California desert was still a huge leap, and the element of surprise certainly worked in her favor. The last six of her seven matches were against players she had never faced on tour: Dominika Cibulkova, Stefanie Voegele, Wang Qiang, Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza, Elina Svitolina and Kerber.'
b'The tour\xe2\x80\x99s veterans will now have a better idea of what to expect, but it will not be easy to identify areas of weakness.'
b'Andreescu has a remarkably complete game for a player of any age, much less an 18-year-old. Despite struggling physically at times against Svitolina in their semifinal and again versus Kerber, Andreescu was still able to display her full palette of all-court skills.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think she has a tennis that is really complete, and on the mental side, she\xe2\x80\x99s a warrior,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruneau, who helped her on the mental side with some well-chosen words on coaching visits in the second and third sets on Sunday.'
b'Andreescu can bang groundstrokes at a world-class clip or change pace abruptly with slice. She also can hit rolling, off-speed, angled winners from either wing that might well become her trademark. Time and again, she kept Kerber, a counterpuncher who thrives on consistent pace, from settling into a rhythm.'
b'Andreescu can attack the net or defend in the corners with her foot speed and excellent footwork. She has a strong first serve and, perhaps more important in the return-focused women\xe2\x80\x99s game, a solid second serve that is difficult to attack.'
b'Andreescu also likes the drop shot, which can be a joy and a curse \xe2\x80\x94 as was evident against Kerber. Andreescu hit some exquisite winners and some tight, untimely errors with the risky shot. But after failing to convert three match points on her serve at 5-3 in the third set, she roared back after the changeover to break Kerber\xe2\x80\x99s serve for the victory.'
b'Ranked No. 60 before the tournament began, Andreescu will be 24th on Monday. She has more than quadrupled her career prize money, earning $1,354,010 for her victory.'
b'Not bad, given that she still does not have a high-school degree, which she is trying to complete online.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard because after practice, that\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing I want to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just so tired, but I believe knowledge is power.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 The story of Juan Ponce de Le\xc3\xb3n searching for a fountain of youth in Florida may be apocryphal, but this week at the men\xe2\x80\x99s event of the Miami Open, there seems to be something revitalizing in the water.'
b'Felix Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, is the youngest man to reach the semifinals in the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s history. His compatriot and friend Denis Shapovalov, 19, will join him in the semifinals after beating the American Frances Tiafoe, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-2, in a quarterfinal Thursday evening.'
b'Auger-Aliassime, ranked 57th, booked his spot in the semifinals with a 7-6 (3), 6-2 win over 11th-seeded Borna Coric on Wednesday night. Coric, 22, was eight years younger than the next-oldest quarterfinalist, but still far more experienced than Auger-Aliassime, who is in the main draw of a Masters event for just the fifth time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPlaying Borna, who\xe2\x80\x99s been established for a few years now, I definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Auger-Aliassime said, adding that he was especially surprised with how he was able to control the second set after a grueling opening set that lasted more than an hour.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I had margin over him, had a bit of an edge,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI just felt really comfortable out there from the first balls.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Excitement and expectations preceded Auger-Aliassime years before he was ready for the professional tour. He was a highly touted junior by the time he turned 15; his matches on small courts at the 2015 United States Open were swarmed with scouts and sponsors.'
b'His potential, evident then, is clearer now. Like many in his generation, Auger-Aliassime is comfortable on all parts of the court; he hit a particularly convincing sliding forehand volley winner to extend his lead to 2-0 in the second set.'
b'Shapovalov and Tiafoe relished knifing sharply angled drop volley winners during their match Thursday, exchanging a high-five at the net after one particularly sublime shot by Shapovalov.'
b'The on-court flair extends to the normally rote postmatch rituals, too. Shapovalov celebrated a win in Indian Wells, Calif., by rapping several bars in his on-court interview. When Auger-Aliassime signs his initials on the TV camera lens after a win, it at first appears as if he is writing the name of a fraternity someone his age might be pledging: Gamma Lambda Lambda \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9c\xce\x93\xce\x9b\xce\x9b\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 before striking through the letters to create a stylized \xe2\x80\x9cFAA.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ranked 182nd a year ago, Auger-Aliassime, who grew up in Montreal, broke into the top 100 after reaching the final of the ATP tournament in Rio de Janeiro in February. He is poised to be ranked 33rd on Monday and would crack the top 20 if he wins the title on Sunday.'
b'Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are the second and third teenagers to reach the Miami Open quarterfinals since 2007, when Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic did (Alexander Zverev did it in 2017). Murray, Djokovic and the eight teenage boys to achieve the feat before them went on to reach the No. 1 ranking and win at least one Grand Slam title. (A 17-year-old Rafael Nadal first beat Roger Federer in Miami, in 2004. He reached the final the next year.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously it\xe2\x80\x99s a privilege to be compared to all these great players,\xe2\x80\x9d Auger-Aliassime said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it just shows that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing good things, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the right track.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, yeah, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing the long term, and right now I\xe2\x80\x99m just enjoying every day, enjoying every match, because you never know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen next.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Auger-Aliassime\xe2\x80\x99s success in Miami comes on the heels of another surprising run by an 18-year-old Canadian: Bianca Andreescu\xe2\x80\x99s title last week in Indian Wells.'
b'As women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis is being lifted by the breakthroughs of young players like Andreescu and Naomi Osaka, men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis has been eagerly awaiting new blood as players in their 30s like Djokovic, Federer and Nadal continue to dominate the tour.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a lot of newcomers with talent gunning for them, and every week it feels like someone new is making a breakthrough and playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shapovalov. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s really healthy to see a couple new stars in the game, and the fans get to watch something new, other than the top four.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The ATP began a campaign few years ago to highlight its \xe2\x80\x9cNext Gen\xe2\x80\x9d players; the results have been mixed. While four quarterfinalists in Miami are 22 or younger, the four others are 30 or older.'
b'Zverev, now 21, is ranked third, but has struggled in Grand Slam tournaments. Stefanos Tsitsipas, 20, has risen to No. 10, spurred by a run to the Australian Open semifinals that included a win over Federer.'
b'Shapovalov had his breakthrough moment at the 2017 Rogers Cup in Montreal, beating Nadal, ranked No. 1 at the time, en route to reaching the semifinals as a 17-year-old. He then reached the fourth round at the U.S. Open.'
b'Tiafoe, 21, was in his first Masters quarterfinal, backing up his quarterfinal run at the Australian Open in January.'
b'There is hope that this tournament is further evidence that reinforcements are finally ready to replenish the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour. Tiafoe believes it\xe2\x80\x99s already happening.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x98Next Gen,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re definitely here, knocking on the door to do some good things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Auger-Aliassime will face seventh-seeded John Isner, 33, on Friday for a spot in the final. Auger-Aliassime\xe2\x80\x99s record against top players is limited but spotless: he is 5-0 against top-20 opponents.'
b'How Auger-Aliassime\xe2\x80\x99s form will translate into Grand Slam tennis played over best-of-five sets is still an open question. At last year\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Open, his only main-draw appearance at a major, he retired in the third set of his first-round match against Shapovalov because of heart palpitations.'
b'Federer, 37, remains the oldest player in the draw. He will play his quarterfinal match against Kevin Anderson, 32, on Thursday night.'
b'Federer turned 19 the day Auger-Aliassime was born. Federer said he enjoyed seeing members of the young generation square off against one another, particularly savoring the fourth-round match between Shapovalov and Tsitsipas, which was decided in a third-set tiebreaker.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI loved seeing them slug it out, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they are going to have big matches down the road,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like when they also have to play each other a little bit, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t look across the net and see a guy ranked whatever it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s just another guy they know from the juniors, and \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to beat you up now.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'WOMEN\xe2\x80\x99S SEMIFINALS In a women\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal that was delayed by five hours because of intermittent rain on Thursday afternoon, 12th-seeded Ashleigh Barty reached the biggest final of her career, beating 21st-seeded Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 6-3.'
b'In the final, Barty will face fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who denied the No. 2 seed, Simona Halep, a win that would have returned her to the top world ranking. Pliskova won, 7-5, 6-1. Barty, 22, will make her debut in the WTA Top 10 on Monday.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 For the first three games, Serena Williams was in a deep, irresistible groove: pounding serves and ground strokes as Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza watched the winners zoom by.'
b'Who could have known, as Williams took a quick 3-0 lead, that she would not win another game on Sunday?'
b'With Williams visibly hampered, increasingly slow on her feet and unable to hit serves at full power, Muguruza reeled off seven straight games. Muguruza was up to a 6-3, 1-0 lead before Williams walked to her chair instead of changing ends, sitting down heavily and then retiring from this third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open.'
b'The WTA Tour announced that the reason for Williams\xe2\x80\x99s retirement was a \xe2\x80\x9cviral illness.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the match, I did not feel great, and then it just got worse with every second: extreme dizziness and extreme fatigue,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said in a statement released by the tournament. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the score, it might have looked like I started well, but I was not feeling at all well physically.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Muguruza, a tall, powerful Spaniard who is seeded 20th, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe played many times, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always supertough and superexciting, and it\xe2\x80\x99s never good to see someone not feeling well on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The retirement was the latest on-court setback for the 37-year-old Williams, who has had some remarkable results since returning to the tour last year after childbirth but has yet to win a title.'
b'This was her second tournament of 2019 and only her third event in six months. Last September, she reached the United States Open final before losing her cool and the match to Naomi Osaka.'
b'In January, she quickly hit plenty of high notes again on her way to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, where she rolled her left ankle while holding a 5-1, 40-30 lead in the third set against Karolina Pliskova.'
b'Pliskova went on to save four match points in all. She won the next six games and the match, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.'
b'It was an unprecedented Grand Slam collapse for Williams, one of the supreme competitors in the history of women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis.'
b'But Williams returned to Florida and the practice court and then returned to action at Indian Wells on Friday, playing one of the finest matches of her comeback, defeating Victoria Azarenka, 7-5, 6-3.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re both moms, and we know how hard it is and how hard it\xe2\x80\x99s been for us to come back, you know, and starting literally from scratch and fighting our way back,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been an arduous road, and I think we both really appreciate both of our efforts to do the best that we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Williams returned to Court One to face Muguruza, she was soon striking the ball as cleanly and convincingly as she had against Azarenka.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that match with Vika was such a high level of tennis from both of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kathy Rinaldi, the United States Fed Cup captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd today, Serena started off carrying on. It was coming off the racket, easy power and very consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was their first meeting since Muguruza defeated Williams to win her first major singles title at the 2016 French Open.'
b'But Williams, back in the top 10 and seeded 10th, could not sustain her remarkable level. Muguruza raised her own, fighting to hold serve in the fourth game, breaking Williams in the next game and then ripping a series of backhand down-the-line winners to hold serve at love and even the match at 3-3.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think she started playing well right away, with her serve, with her shots, being very dominating,\xe2\x80\x9d Muguruza said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to adapt a little bit my position in the court, the way I was hitting. And it took me a few games to kind of do it. Once I did it, I felt much more comfortable to be able to release my tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams started the seventh game with an off-balance double fault into the net and began hitting first serves consistently below 100 miles per hour. She double faulted again later in the game and barely moved as Muguruza hit a forehand winner to go ahead, 4-3.'
b'Williams then walked very slowly to her chair and looked frustrated on the first point of the next game, taking a huge, angry cut at a forehand return that she hit into the net.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the first set, I felt maybe she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t feeling well, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Muguruza said.'
b'Williams soon provided confirmation. After losing the set, she called for a trainer and was eventually surrounded by the tour supervisor Donna Kelso, the trainer Paige Kensrue and a tournament physician. Though Kensrue arrived on court with a blood-pressure cuff, she did not take a reading on Williams and no official medical timeout was taken.'
b'After extended discussion, Williams returned to the court to start the second set but did not win another point as Muguruza held serve at love.'
b'One of Williams\xe2\x80\x99s signatures is that after the first game of a set, she does not change ends on the chair umpire\xe2\x80\x99s side of the net, crossing over on the opposite side without approaching her own seat. But she changed her routine this time, heading straight for her chair and then retiring.'
b'It was only Williams\xe2\x80\x99s third midmatch retirement since 2009. Her next scheduled event is the Miami Open later this month.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think Serena always has the confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Rinaldi said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at her record coming back from having baby Olympia: two finals of Grand Slams. I think she knows what she is capable of. Self-belief, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue. Obviously today was a little bit of a setback, but I think since she came back that she has gotten better and better and stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Danielle Collins, who had not won a match at a Grand Slam tournament before this year, pummeled second-seeded Angelique Kerber in the fourth round on Sunday, sealing the most stunning result of the Australian Open with a 6-0, 6-2 victory that took just 55 minutes to complete.'
b'Collins commanded the match from the beginning, dictating play by aggressively attacking, particularly with her two-handed backhand. She hit 29 winners in the match, compared to just six for Kerber.'
b'Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion from Germany, had few solutions for Collins and was unable to use her counterpunching to wrest control of the match at any point.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was completely not my day,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerber said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not playing the tennis that I can play. She played really well. I think she played one of her best matches, to be honest. She hit, yeah, every ball in the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After losing the first set in just 20 minutes, Kerber walked off the court of Margaret Court Arena in an apparent effort to change the momentum of the match, leaving Collins grinning as she waited.'
b'Kerber won the first two points after she returned, playing with a renewed purpose and shouts of encouragement to herself, but Collins again announced her presence in the match by screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d back at Kerber after hitting a drop-shot winner on the third point.'
b'Collins\xe2\x80\x99s pugnacious attitude is well known in tennis, and something she readily acknowledges and embraces, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cjust part of the deal with me\xe2\x80\x9d on court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, you all know: I\xe2\x80\x99m my own person; I\xe2\x80\x99m feisty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love making it kind of a war. If somebody wants to get in my face on my unforced errors, I have no problem getting right back at them and making it a feisty match. I love that, embrace it. I love when things get competitive.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The tenacity in her tennis extends to off-court pursuits as well.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven karaoke \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good voice, but I always try to do the best at whatever I\xe2\x80\x99m doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Collins, a 25-year-old Floridian. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I still tell myself I\xe2\x80\x99m the best. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to believe it, right?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That unshakability was clear as Collins closed out her victory. Kerber broke in the first game of the second set after their verbal exchange, but Collins broke back in the next game, and then pulled ahead of Kerber for good when she broke again for 4-2.'
b'Mat Cloer, one of Collins\xe2\x80\x99s coaches, said that she had played \xe2\x80\x9cpretty flawless\xe2\x80\x9d in the first set and had done what she needed to retain the momentum.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew after the first set that she was going to come out and make that second push,\xe2\x80\x9d Cloer said of Kerber. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she did, and Danielle handled it really, really well. She showed great composure, but also didn\xe2\x80\x99t back down. She lost the first game of the second set, but she showed that she was a little fiery at Angie.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think that allowed her to show, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m still here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fight this through,\xe2\x80\x99 which I think didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it easy for Angie to get out of it \xe2\x80\x94 and Danielle just kept going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Collins, a two-time national champion in singles for the University of Virginia, is the first collegiate player to reach the quarterfinals of women\xe2\x80\x99s singles at a Grand Slam event since Lisa Raymond at the 2004 Australian Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think going to college helped me develop myself as a person,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said. \xe2\x80\x9cI really know who I am, the type of person I am, what I want, what I want to do with my life, what I want to do with my tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have other interests and passions aside from tennis. I\xe2\x80\x99m able to relax a little bit more, maybe, than some other people because they\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of just been doing tennis their whole life, haven\xe2\x80\x99t really ventured out much.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Collins did her homework before the biggest victory of her career, watching footage of Kerber\xe2\x80\x99s matches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had a clear mind-set of what I was going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the very first point, I showed her that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to let her into the match, that I was going to dictate the entire way through. I stuck to my game plan. It clearly worked out well for me, pretty much smooth sailing throughout the entire thing. I was just feeling really great.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Collins has been a quick study in the elite levels of professional tennis. Ranked 162nd a year ago, she broke through with a run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last March, beating Venus Williams en route.'
b'Collins, now No. 35 in the rankings, will face 44th-ranked Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Tuesday for a spot in the semifinals after Pavlyuchenkova upset No. 5 Sloane Stephens, 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3. Simon Goffin, Pavlyuchenkova\xe2\x80\x99s coach, said he knew Collins could rise to the occasion of an opponent like Kerber.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe really likes these big stadiums, to play against the seeds, to be a bit of an underdog,\xe2\x80\x9d Goffin said of Collins. \xe2\x80\x9cShe really likes this. She\xe2\x80\x99s a tough challenger. She likes a big challenge, she likes a fight, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Collins did not moderate her hopes for the next match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, another amazing match of tennis for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her on-court interview, one of several answers that drew startled gasps from audience members not used to such unapologetic self-assuredness.'
b'Collins said she was animated by antagonism.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just love competition,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether people are for me or against me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really fazed by it. I love it. Either way. I kind of like it more when people cheer against me sometimes because I want to get them back, prove them wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Despite Collins\xe2\x80\x99s ability to build up her ranking, success at Grand Slams did not come until this tournament. Her first-round win over 14th-seeded Julia G\xc3\xb6rges was her first main draw victory at a Grand Slam event.'
b'In her news conference, Collins pointed out that her draws in her three previous Grand Slam matches had been far from enviable, as she opened against a top-20 opponent each time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI did everything I could in those situations,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said of her losses to Caroline Wozniacki, Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go the way you want it to. Everybody gets their shot at the pie. Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly getting mine. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing very well. I\xe2\x80\x99m just kind of focused on that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In her on-court interview after the victory, Collins made it clear that she was confident of further slices of sweet Slam success.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI may not have won a Grand Slam match before this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell you: I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep happening.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Sometimes Grand Slam breakthroughs, even for the most hyped and promising tennis players, come when least expected. Consider the case of Frances Tiafoe, the 21-year-old American hopeful who limped into this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open with little to suggest his first week would unfold in the stirring way that it has.'
b'An electric talent who has been talked about since his midteens because of his potential and hardscrabble history, Tiafoe, ranked 39th, staggered through the end of last season. Then he went winless in a string of early January exhibition matches in Perth. Six days before this tournament began, he was outgunned at a warm-up tournament in Sydney by the Australian journeyman John Millman.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerth was terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said. \xe2\x80\x9cSydney was bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Buzz? The kind of stirring expectations that surrounded the Federer slayer Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 14th-seeded Greek player, going into Melbourne?'
b'Around Tiafoe, there was no buzz.'
b'But all that changed over the first week of this tournament, a stretch that Tiafoe, a 6-foot-2 power hitter, capped on a hot Sunday afternoon with a round-of-16 win over Grigor Dimitrov, who was seeded No. 20. The score was 7-5, 7-6 (6), 6-7 (1), 7-5.'
b'It was a third straight upset for a player who, entering this tournament, had never won a match at the Australian Open and had been in the draw only once, in 2018. Now, with a surprise win on his 21st birthday, Tiafoe has launched into the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tiafoe, known for his unvarnished candor, speaking to a packed crowd at Melbourne Arena after the match.'
b'For all the hard work in a match that lasted nearly four hours, he next faces Rafael Nadal, the second seed, who has won the Australian Open once, in 2009. Nadal, of course, will be an overwhelming favorite. But Tiafoe will have a confidence he has never had before, and strong backing from fans.'
b'Tiafoe, one of the few black male players in pro tennis, has become a crowd favorite in Melbourne, captivating crowds with his personality, flair-filled game and bare-chested celebrations that have followed each of his three big upsets. (He has made a habit of ripping his shirt off after a win, pounding his chest and his right biceps, and punching the air, a nod to moves made by LeBron James, one of his idols.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is crazy man, this is crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said a few hours after the match. His eyes sparkled. He looked as if he were in awe of his accomplishment. He recalled his past. Tiafoe\xe2\x80\x99s parents fled a civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s and settled outside Washington. His father had been a custodian at a public tennis center in College Park, Md., and young Frances and his twin brother learned the game there.'
b'In his early teens, Tiafoe promised his family that he would one day become a star tennis player, and take care of everyone.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a normal tennis story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'In the beginning of his career, he said, he had been playing for his family. Not long ago, he bought his mother a house and he is indeed providing his family with a comfortable life. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do it for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dimitrov, 27, is a tour stalwart known for his immense talent, long among the world\xe2\x80\x99s top-20 men\xe2\x80\x99s players, and the winner of eight tour titles. But from the start of this match, Tiafoe, who has won just a single title, gave as good as he got.'
b'The match turned in the second set tiebreaker. Facing a trio of set points, Tiafoe responded as he has all week \xe2\x80\x94 first in his win against Kevin Anderson, one of the tournament favorites, and then over the 35th-ranked Italian veteran Andreas Seppi. He buckled down, kept his chin up and a spring in his step, and scorched a series of winners and error-inducing groundstrokes. Not long afterward, aided by a Dimitrov double fault, the set was his, and soon the match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn that tiebreak, as much as I was playing better and better, he just kept coming back with good answers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dimitrov, whose own Grand Slam coming out came in 2014, when he lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to the eventual champion, Novak Djokovic.'
b'On Sunday, after a match point in which a Dimitrov groundstroke fell into the net, Tiafoe bent over in the moment, hands on his knees, stunned. Who could blame him? He had struggled at the end of last year, losing matches a player of his talent is expected to win.'
b'His traveling coach, Zack Evenden, explained that a turn came following the painful defeat two weeks ago to Millman, ranked No. 37, at the Sydney International.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMillman wanted it more,\xe2\x80\x9d Evenden said. He recalled Tiafoe realizing that he could learn from the Australian journeyman, who is deeply admired on tour for his doggedness. \xe2\x80\x9cTalent is not enough to get you where you want to be. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to turn up for every single point. You have got to want it, and want it bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tiafoe now goes up against a player who has 17 Gand Slam titles and is perhaps the greatest competitor in tennis history.'
b'Nadal \xe2\x80\x9cis going to run me like crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said after the match. Then he flashed the self-assurance that comes with a first major tournament breakthrough: \xe2\x80\x9cHe better get ready.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the Italian player Frances Tiafoe beat. He is Andreas Seppi, not Andrea.'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 It\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar sight to have a top player\xe2\x80\x99s sister in the draw of the Miami Open, where this year Venus and Serena Williams are both competing for a 17th time.'
b'But this tournament is the first time at a WTA-level event that top-ranked Naomi Osaka was joined in the singles main draw by her older sister, Mari.'
b'Everyone else in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis is ranked below Naomi Osaka right now, including Mari, 22, who is ranked 338th, and normally plays lower-level events.'
b'She received a wild card for this tournament and played her first WTA main draw match on Thursday against another wild card, 205th-ranked Whitney Osuigwe. Osaka acquitted herself well in a 6-2, 6-4 loss.'
b'Naomi Osaka, who is 18 months younger than her sister, said that it was \xe2\x80\x9creally enjoyable\xe2\x80\x9d to have her Mari with her at a tournament, and that she hoped it would be an experience they shared far more in the future.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me it would be a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk to that many people, and she\xe2\x80\x99s the nicer one in this relationship. It would definitely mean a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Though siblings like the Williamses or Marat Safin and Dinara Safina have risen to the peaks of the sport, siblings with far different career altitudes are more common.'
b'Naomi Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s opposite number in the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour, top-ranked Novak Djokovic, had two younger brothers who struggled in the large shadow he cast. Despite receiving many wild cards, Marko Djokovic reached a career-high ranking of No. 571; Djordje Djokovic reached No. 1,463. Marko, 27, now coaches and competes only occasionally, while Djordje, 23, stopped competing in 2015.'
b'Novak Djokovic, 31, said that his brothers\xe2\x80\x99 decisions to step back from tennis had come as a relief to him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided themselves what they want to do, because in the end of the day it\xe2\x80\x99s something that gives me satisfaction and peace, knowing that they made the decision, not myself or my parents or anybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause in this kind of circumstance, they feel obliged, or they feel pressure that they have to meet the expectations of the other brother or sister. Because if you\xe2\x80\x99re part of the same sport, naturally, everyone will compare you to your other siblings. It\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, especially if your other sibling is the best in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Siblings of top players have often drafted off that familial fame to get started in their career, but the main draw wild card for Mari Osaka raised many eyebrows around the tournament, considering she was ranked more than 200 spots below the cut for the qualifying draw for this elite event. James Blake, the Miami Open tournament director, said the decision to double the number of Osakas in the draw had been an easy one.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously Naomi is someone that\xe2\x80\x99s accomplished so much, and you want to encourage her sister as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talent and she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the same opportunities. We know she\xe2\x80\x99ll also be a draw. Naomi has so many fans; Mari is going to hopefully gain some of those fans by association.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Blake, who reached a career-best of No. 4, had a brother, Thomas, who reached 264th \xe2\x80\x94 a parallel that he admitted tinted his view.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe got some wild cards, definitely with the Blake name,\xe2\x80\x9d James Blake said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe really appreciated them. Mari has thanked me, her parents have thanked me. They realize that this is a big opportunity for her.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is rarer for the younger sibling to make a splash on tour first. For most of their childhoods, Mari had dominated her younger sister in practice matches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUp until I was 15 she was 6-0-ing me, ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d Naomi said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened, maybe finally something clicked in my head, but for sure she was beating me. In the win-loss record, she\xe2\x80\x99s up by like a million or something.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Both entered the qualifying draw of the WTA tournament in Stanford, Calif., in 2014. Naomi, then 16, reached the main draw and then stunned the 2011 United States Open champion, Samantha Stosur, in the first round.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably the second-best win of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said after that victory, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first being when I first beat my sister.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As Naomi continued to soar upward, Mari\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory stalled; her career-best ranking was 280th last May. Before Thursday she had not competed for more than a month because of a right shoulder injury. Her first match this season was a 6-0, 6-0 loss to 471st-ranked Katie Volynets, a far cry from the competitive level she showed on Thursday.'
b'Mari Osaka said she was determined to play this tournament, knowing for the past six months that she would be awarded a wild card.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just super exciting and new for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mari said of the experience. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m super thankful that I actually got it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She smiled at the mention of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s rise from 70th to first in the rankings since the beginning of last year. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of her,\xe2\x80\x9d Mari said.'
b'Asked if she was able to focus on her own path or felt she had \xe2\x80\x9cbig shoes to fill,\xe2\x80\x9d Mari said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy own journey is separate, but of course I tend to compare a little bit, so it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating. But, you know, not much I can do about that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka then abruptly broke into tears. She apologized, accepted a moderator\xe2\x80\x99s offer to leave the room to regain her composure, and returned several minutes later.'
b'When she returned, she was able to focus on the positives she took from the match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI played this match with no pain, which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done in such a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels really good, like I can keep moving forward from here.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 At the start of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open, the French tennis player Lucas Pouille was a man severely overlooked.'
b'He had come to Melbourne, after all, on the heels of a 2018 season that dripped with disappointing losses, trying more than anything else to simply recapture a sense of joy on the court.'
b'Expectations? Any that existed were extremely slim, Pouille said, as he looked back Wednesday on a tournament that now stands as the most thrilling of his seven-year career. Slim, from those on the outside looking in, he said, and \xe2\x80\x9ceven from myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But in the world of professional tennis, slim expectations can grow Grand Slam fat with remarkable speed. They certainly have this week for Pouille. On Wednesday afternoon at Melbourne Park, the Frenchman moved into his first Grand Slam semifinal with a sharp 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 victory over Milos Raonic of Canada, the lumbering former Wimbledon finalist with the massive serve who was seeded 16th.'
b'Pouille, who had never won an Australian Open match before last week, now faces a nearly impossible task. The final is within his reach. But to get there he must beat Novak Djokovic, who currently rules men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis with an iron grip.'
b'Not long after Pouille and Raonic left Rod Laver Arena, Djokovic breezed into the final four, his quarterfinal match done in just 52 minutes when the eighth-seeded Kei Nishikori, of Japan, retired with a leg injury. Djokovic led by 6-1, 4-1 at the time, and had never been pushed. It was a gift. A match that short and stress free will help Djokovic, seeking his seventh Australian Open title, keep his body fresh at the stage in this tournament when he most needs it, especially since he had struggled through a bruising, four-set win over Daniil Medvedev earlier this week.'
b'Pouille, 24 years old and seeded 28th, burst onto the scene in 2016, with quarterfinal showings at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, where he beat Nadal.'
b'Last season, however, was tennis purgatory. True, his ranking did rise briefly to a career-high No. 10 in March. But he also failed to get past the third round of any of the major championships. He lost to players ranked outside the top 100. And as the year ended, he suffered through a string of early tournament defeats.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI lost that joy being on the court,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, reflecting on last year after his quarterfinal match, which he won behind strong serving and a steady dose of returns that left the 6-5 Raonic off balance. \xe2\x80\x9cFor some reason, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know really know why it happened. I t did. You lose one match, two matches, three matches, then you lose confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Searching for a solution, he last month replaced his old coach with Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo, the 39-year-old former pro who is a hero in France because of her pair of Grand Slam singles titles and because she is the last French player, male of female, to reach world No. 1.'
b'Other top male players are coached by a woman, but those female coaches are relatives. Pouille\xe2\x80\x99s arrangement with Mauresmo continues to be a story line, even though Mauresmo has coached men before, notably Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Andy Murray, whom she guided to the Melbourne final in 2015.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMen are coaching women, so why not the contrary?\xe2\x80\x9d Pouille said at his news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about being a man or a woman, it\xe2\x80\x99s about knowing tennis, about having the good state of mind.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He summed up the ways that Mauresmo has helped him turn a corner. She creates \xe2\x80\x9ca cool atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not too serious. We can laugh. We can make jokes. Once we go and hit the balls, we are really into it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In other words, balance.'
b'And more: \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s bringing a lot of confidence to my game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pouille will need every ounce of cool confidence, and likely the best tennis of his life, if he is to beat Djokovic on a packed center court stadium Friday.'
b'Will Pouille be overlooked once again?'
b'Not a chance, said Djokovic. \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought he\xe2\x80\x99s a great player,\xe2\x80\x9d the Serb told the assembled reporters in the wake of his own quarterfinal win.'
b'Pouille \xe2\x80\x9cdeserves to be definitely at the top 15, maybe top 10 of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got that quality and potential, no question about it. Here we go. It\xe2\x80\x99s the semifinals. We both want to get to the finals. Hopefully we can both be fresh and fit and put on the great show.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.'
b'April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s amazing, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.'
b'But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.'
b'Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.'
b'She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.'
b'Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women\xe2\x80\x99s season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.'
b'There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men\xe2\x80\x99s doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.'
b'The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Bryan said.'
b'Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.'
b'Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.'
b'But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.'
b'Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.'
b'Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cteam\xe2\x80\x9d more than \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d when discussing her rise.)'
b'Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.'
b'Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s final.'
b'But it is Barty\xe2\x80\x99s tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.'
b'Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova\xe2\x80\x99s six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova\xe2\x80\x99s 66 percent.'
b'Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.'
b'Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Barty said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always about trying to neutralize what your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women\xe2\x80\x99s side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova\xe2\x80\x99s flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).'
b'It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think I was an average cricketer, and I\xe2\x80\x99m becoming a better tennis player,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.'
b'Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Back on the march as the best player in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, Novak Djokovic stumbled in the desert sunlight on Tuesday on his favorite surface.'
b'Djokovic flubbed some forehands and returns he normally makes in his third-round match at the BNP Paribas Open and cracked a racket in frustration. But he also ran into an inspired opponent in Philipp Kohlschreiber, a 35-year-old German who had lost seven straight matches to Djokovic but has long savored the memory of surprising Djokovic in the fourth round of the 2009 French Open.'
b'Now, nearly a decade later, Kohlschreiber has another upset tale to tell.'
b'No, Djokovic was not at his precise and predatory best, but Kohlschreiber still had to summon plenty of quality shot making and decision-making under pressure to finish him off, 6-4, 6-4.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you always need the No. 1 not playing his best tennis to beat him, but I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy with my performance,\xe2\x80\x9d Kohlschreiber said.'
b'It was a rough day all around for No. 1s. Naomi Osaka, the top player in the women\xe2\x80\x99s game, was more soundly beaten. She lost, 6-3, 6-1, in the fourth round to Belinda Bencic in just 66 minutes. Osaka has won the last two Grand Slam singles titles, yet Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s result was no shock. Bencic, who just turned 22, is yet another great talent from Switzerland, land of Roger Federer and Martina Hingis. Bencic broke into the top 10 as a teenager in 2016 before left wrist surgery stopped her ascent.'
b'She broke Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s powerful serve five times in this brief encounter and proved more steady from the baseline, as well. She is now on a 11-match winning streak after winning the title in Dubai and has five victories over top 10 players in the last month.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy injury just changed my perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bencic, the No. 23 seed. \xe2\x80\x9cI learned so much from this time, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really enjoying to be on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hardcourts remain Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s happiest hunting ground. Ten of his 15 Grand Slam singles titles have come on the surface that suits his elastic athleticism best.'
b'He also has won five singles titles at Indian Wells, but after winning three straight times here in 2015, 2016 and 2017, he has run into early-round trouble.'
b'Last year, in the midst of a deep funk and still recovering from elbow surgery, he made 58 unforced errors in an opening-match defeat to Taro Daniel, a Japanese qualifier. But this year, Djokovic arrived on an undeniable roll after sweeping to victory at the Australian Open, manhandling Rafael Nadal in the final.'
b'Djokovic has won three straight Grand Slam singles titles and will hold all four for the second time if he can prevail at the French Open in June and complete another so-called \xe2\x80\x9cDjoker Slam.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He is still in the doubles here after reaching the semifinals with partner Fabio Fognini later on Tuesday, but only the tournaments ahead will show if Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s singles performance was a blip or a harbinger of more struggles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had to get over it in an hour, because I played doubles,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must admit I was thinking about it. When I hit a good return, I was wondering why this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in singles. But it is, I guess, part of the world that we are, the world of tennis. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of our world, and we just have to bounce back very quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic said competing in the doubles gave him \xe2\x80\x9ca chance to rectify the wrongs,\xe2\x80\x9d but that his singles performance would not affect him in the long run.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know what I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the quality of my tennis. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those days. You just have to congratulate your opponent and move on.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The timing was intriguing, coming after a week replete with tennis politicking. Djokovic, as president of the ATP Player Council, spent the days before the tournament in meetings and debate, and the ATP\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors ultimately voted last Thursday not to renew the contract of Chris Kermode, the tour\xe2\x80\x99s chairman and chief executive.'
b'There has been plenty of pushback on the decision, with Nadal and Federer both pointing out that they were not consulted by Djokovic or council members in the run-up to the Kermode decision. Federer said he had reached out directly to Djokovic who had been unable to find time on his schedule for a discussion.'
b'But then neither Nadal nor Federer are on the council at this stage, although both have served in the past. Federer, a former president, has acknowledged that the role can be draining, particularly in fraught times, and Djokovic spoke about that challenge on Sunday after defeating American Bjorn Fratangelo in his opening match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI care about the current generation and also the future generation and future of this sport,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that the sport is doing well, but it can also do better and better, you know, as we go along. And if I, with my status and with my position in the world of sport and tennis, can influence that positively, then why not? Yes, it takes away in energy and time, but I know I do it from the right place in my heart and with the right intent, and then I also receive a lot of energy for that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He has received some criticism, too, but appears intent on trying to push for structural reforms on the ATP Tour, which could include dividing Kermode\xe2\x80\x99s role into two separate positions, or changing the size or composition of the board.'
b'Success is far from guaranteed considering the internal tensions that exist in the ATP: an organization that is a long-running and often uneasy partnership between the players and those who own and operate the tournaments.'
b'It would be all too easy to get distracted.'
b'But some rejected any such speculation on Tuesday and emphasized Kohlschreiber\xe2\x80\x99s performance. Among them: Nick Kyrgios, the unpredictable and intermittently committed Australian who won a hardcourt title in Mexico last week in style but was beaten, 6-4, 6-4, by Kohlschreiber in the second round here.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomething has to be wrong with him right?\xe2\x80\x9d Kyrgios tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Djokovic. \xe2\x80\x9cI lose to Kholi and get absolutely shredded \xe2\x80\x98same old kyrgios\xe2\x80\x99 how about the guy is just good? And he knows how to win matches? Hate this, why we always gotta kiss these guys when they lose?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kohlschreiber was unseeded here but not by much with a world ranking of 39. Quick and powerful, he has one of the prettiest one-handed backhands in the game yet does his most consistent damage with his forehand.'
b'But in truth, he needed all his tennis tools to win on Tuesday after rain suspended play on Monday night after just one game. He also needed to put 71 percent of his first serves in play and save three of four break points against the game\xe2\x80\x99s premier returner.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think I was not unhappy with the rain delay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the warmer conditions suited my game more today. I was fresh. I had two good wins. So everything came together.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Such moments have been hard to come by in the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest events during Kohlschreiber\xe2\x80\x99s career, which has coincided with one of the greatest generations of stars in tennis history. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have 52 Grand Slam singles titles between them.'
b'Kohlschreiber said he appreciated their greatness but also appreciated the benefits of minor as opposed to major celebrity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still able to walk on the street or go to, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and there is just a few guys saying, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s maybe Kohlschreiber,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Roger or Rafa can do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The main clay-court season is officially underway, and this time around it is particularly unclear how the dust might settle.'
b'If Rafael Nadal is truly healthy after aggravating a right knee injury three weeks ago \xe2\x80\x94 he has been training at home to prepare for the Monte Carlo Open \xe2\x80\x94 he remains the man to beat on the game\xe2\x80\x99s grittiest surface. No one else has won 11 French Open singles titles, and the rational assumption is that no one else ever will.'
b'But the women\xe2\x80\x99s game is in a wondrous state of flux, with 14 different champions in the season\xe2\x80\x99s first 14 tournaments. And none of them was named Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova or Simona Halep.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s by far the most wide-open field as far as I can remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Evert, the former No. 1 and a seven-time French Open champion, said in an interview Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one seems to have obvious momentum above the other. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only the closeness in talent and skills. Attitudes, emotions and fitness and injuries enter into it as well. I have no clue.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Serena Williams has not won a title since returning to the tour in March 2018 after giving birth to her daughter. She has played only three tournaments this season and has not finished any of them feeling healthy. She twisted an ankle while on the brink of victory in an Australian Open quarterfinal against Karolina Pliskova and lost a 5-1 third-set lead, unable to convert on four match points.'
b'In Indian Wells, Calif., Williams retired in the third round against Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza, citing a viral illness. In Miami, she withdrew after winning her opening match, citing a left knee injury. Williams is 37, and her knees have long been a concern, restricting her training through the years. She does not plan to compete again until the Italian Open in Rome in mid-May, shortly before the French Open.'
b'That will leave her short of matches against an increasingly deep and confident field, which is full of young, exciting talents with all-court games who have grown up dealing with big pace. Williams\xe2\x80\x99s quest for a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, which once looked like only a matter of time, is now a more complicated matter.'
b'But discounting Williams is rarely a winning proposition. She has managed to play some sparkling tennis in 2019, striking the ball very cleanly in some of the early rounds in Australia and again in her victory over Victoria Azarenka in Indian Wells.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA healthy Serena is a dangerous Serena; she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been healthy all year,\xe2\x80\x9d Evert said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe still has an edge in power and experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams also has the most impressive career record on clay of any active player: 170-34. Her career winning percentage of 83.3 puts her ahead of Sharapova, who is at 81.5 percent with plenty of doubt swirling about her form and her tennis future at age 31.'
b'Happy off the court but vulnerable on it, she has not competed since January because of injuries and has not reached a tour final since winning the Tianjin Open in October 2017.'
b'Halep has the best clay-court numbers over the last few seasons and leads the WTA Tour\xe2\x80\x99s clay-court power rankings, which give more weight to recent results.'
b'But even as she again closes in on being No. 1, Halep, 27, has hardly been dominant. Oui, she won last year\xe2\x80\x99s French Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. But she has not won another clay-court title since Madrid in May 2017 and has not won a tournament on any surface since the Rogers Cup in Canada in August.'
b'Without Darren Cahill as her coach this season, Halep has not looked like the same resolute and selectively aggressive force, although her run to the semifinals of the Miami Open last week was encouraging.'
b'The biggest prizes in 2019 have gone to younger women, all under age 23.'
b'Naomi Osaka, 21, won the year\xe2\x80\x99s first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and remains No. 1 by a whisker. Belinda Bencic, 22, won the Premier 5 event in Dubai. Most surprisingly, Bianca Andreescu, 18, won the Premier Mandatory event in Indian Wells, and then Ashleigh Barty, 22, confirmed her steady rise by winning in Miami.'
b'Andreescu and Barty have the skills to thrive on clay \xe2\x80\x94 their strong topspin forehands, quick feet and ability to hit sliced backhands, well-disguised drop shots and heavy first and second serves.'
b'But the big-hitting Osaka has a losing record on clay (9-11) and likes to call herself \xe2\x80\x9ca hardcourt player.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She also has lost momentum since her surprising split with her coach, Sascha Bajin, after the Australian Open. She has hired Venus Williams\xe2\x80\x99s former hitting partner, Jermaine Jenkins, a college star with a reassuring courtside demeanor. But for now, Osaka is only 3-3 since winning in Melbourne, with losses to Kristina Mladenovic in Dubai, to Bencic in Indian Wells and to the changeup artist Hsieh Su-wei in Miami.'
b'Novak Djokovic, the men\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1, also has the wind in his face after losing early in Indian Wells and Miami. But he has won three Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and it is difficult to disregard the memory of Djokovic having his way from the baseline against Nadal in the Australian Open final.'
b'Nadal, 32, continues to battle his body. A recurrence of tendinitis in his right knee caused him to withdraw before his semifinal against Roger Federer in Indian Wells. At this stage, he knows too well the price of pushing through pain, although pain has been a constant. How much longer can he do it?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows? Perhaps two or three years more,\xe2\x80\x9d Toni Nadal, his uncle and former coach, said at a recent appearance in Majorca. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is that Rafael is not a person who plays tennis. He is an injured person who plays tennis, and that is very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nadal is back training hard in Majorca on a surface that is more forgiving to his joints than hardcourts. He is on schedule to defend his title in Monte Carlo this month. Djokovic and No. 5 Dominic Thiem, Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s two most obvious rivals for the biggest men\xe2\x80\x99s clay-court titles, are expected to challenge him there. So is third-ranked Alexander Zverev, who has a fine clay-court record and the talent to win multiple majors but has been slumping.'
b'Federer, back on a roll at age 37 after winning in Miami and intent on returning to clay after a three-year break, plans to come back in Madrid in early May after training in Switzerland.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI still think Rafa is in a great place on clay,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Macpherson, the coach of John Isner, the top-ranked American, who may miss much of the clay-court season with a stress fracture in his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only one who has shown the ability to break up Rafa\xe2\x80\x99s game at times is Novak, with his ability to smother that topspin forehand early with his pure two-handed backhand and negate Rafa\xe2\x80\x99s strengths on clay. So that\xe2\x80\x99s always a fascinating matchup.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But based on all the plot twists and ankle twists in 2019 so far, there are no guarantees that it will be the decisive matchup.'
b'Time to watch the dust try to settle.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 It was 2011. Ivo Karlovic was already an ATP Tour veteran with graying temples, and his close friend and former coach Tarik Benhabiles was talking about Karlovic\xe2\x80\x99s serve, and his future.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a huge weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d Benhabiles told me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can play until he\xe2\x80\x99s 40 years old, no problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kudos to Benhabiles, who once helped Andy Roddick become a force, for knowing his tennis. But, above all, kudos to Karlovic, the 6-foot-11 Croatian, for finding a way to fight and serve through everything life has thrown at him.'
b'It has hardly been \xe2\x80\x9cno problem,\xe2\x80\x9d but Karlovic turned 40 on Feb. 28, and he is definitely still playing.'
b'He has won three rounds at the BNP Paribas Open this year and is now the oldest man to win a singles match at a Masters 1000 event. On Wednesday, with plenty of gray in his beard now as well as in his temples, Karlovic will deploy his fearsome weapon against Dominic Thiem, the No. 7 seed, for a place in the quarterfinals.'
b'At 25, Thiem is 15 years younger than Karlovic \xe2\x80\x94 but then just about everybody on tour is younger than Karlovic, including some of his former rivals who are now coaches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s older than me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivan Ljubicic, the 39-year-old co-coach of Roger Federer, who remains the most prominent graybeard in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis but is still Karlovic\xe2\x80\x99s junior at 37.'
b'Karlovic has remained a factor by overcoming a major Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon injury in 2010 and encephalitis in 2013, which caused debilitating headaches and left him temporarily without feeling in his right arm.'
b'He has remained a force by focusing on fitness and dropping weight to take the pressure off his knees and other joints. He is down to 225 pounds, from 245 in 2011.'
b'On court, Karlovic has learned to maximize his strengths and accept his weaknesses. He will never have a drive backhand, but his one-handed slice is crisp enough. And though his lateral mobility remains limited compared to his competitors, his forehand is huge and his serve-and-volley style is even more unusual and disorienting in this baseline-focused era.'
b'In truth, his style is often serve-and-no-volley. He has slammed an ATP record 13,235 aces. Along the way, he has definitively proven, like it or not, that there is a place in a movement-based game for players of towering height like the 6-10 John Isner, the 33-year-old American star, and the 6-11 Reilly Opelka, a 21-year-old from the U.S. who is hitting aces at a rapid clip of his own.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at any sport, everywhere there are taller guys, so I know that is the future in tennis,\xe2\x80\x9d Karlovic said, as he has said for years.'
b'Ljubicic, who had a huge serve of his own and will turn 40 this month, grew up playing junior tournaments with Karlovic in Croatia and elsewhere. It was a time of war in the former Yugoslavia, and tennis was often the least of the youngsters\xe2\x80\x99 concerns.'
b'Fearing for their lives, Ljubicic\xe2\x80\x99s family fled Bosnia and ended up briefly in a refugee camp in Croatia. Ljubicic eventually ended up honing his game in an Italian tennis club and reaching No. 3 in the world in 2006 before retiring in 2012.'
b'Karlovic stayed in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. He was the son of well-educated professionals: his father a meteorologist; his mother an agronomist.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn Zagreb, there were not a lot of airstrikes, but I spent a lot of time in the bomb shelters,\xe2\x80\x9d Karlovic said of his early teens. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was always airstrike warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Funds were short, and so was quality coaching and court time. Karlovic had already decided he preferred tennis to basketball despite attempts to recruit him. He would wait until the evening when the tennis courts in Zagreb were empty and then use the balls he could find and hit serves on his own, sometimes after dark.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only way I could practice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like people to know that my serve is not only that good because of my height. I worked on it a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He did not find a regular coach until his early 20s, and despite his imposing presence he managed to fly far below the radar until the first round of Wimbledon in 2003, where, as an all-but-unknown qualifier in an age before social media, he upset the defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in four sets on Centre Court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not easy: I was looking around at all these huge courts I never had a chance to play on before,\xe2\x80\x9d Karlovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI lost the first set 6-1, but after that I just kind of calmed down and started playing my game, and then after the match, it was not easy because everybody wanted to know, who am I?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'What made it harder was the pronounced stammer that Karlovic has had since boyhood, which made public speaking excruciating.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking to myself, this is what you have to do if you want to become a good player,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of post-match news conferences. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nearly 16 years later, the stammer is much less pronounced, and Karlovic has become not only an excellent player but an enduring one. He peaked in the rankings at No. 14 in 2008 but was still in the top 20 last year before injuries contributed to him dropping to No. 138 in September.'
b'Instead of calling it a career, Karlovic chose to head back to tennis\xe2\x80\x99s minor leagues with the goal of making the main draw of the Australian Open. If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve that goal, he would retire. He played in a series of ATP Challenger events in the final months of 2018, winning one in Calgary.'
b'Australia beckoned. But Karlovic, now based in Plantation, Fla., said one of the biggest challenges has been leaving his family behind. He and his wife, Alsi, have two children: a 7-year-old daughter, Jada, and an 18-month-old son, Noah.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had to leave on Christmas Day to get to a tournament in India,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo everybody was home. We had friends over, family, and then after lunch I was on the way to the airport. It was really difficult. My kids were crying and stuff, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy, but on the other hand, I am doing this also because of them, you know? So they don\xe2\x80\x99t have it as hard as I had it. So maybe that evens out the pain for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He wanted Jada to have a memory of him as a professional tennis player.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut now I also have a little one who is one-and-a-half years old,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karlovic, now ranked No. 89. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I guess for him to remember me I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to play at least another eight more years.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Presumably not even Benhabiles is ready to predict that.'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 This year\xe2\x80\x99s Miami Open is about 20 miles north of its previous home on Key Biscayne, but the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s cultural epicenter is unmoved. It\xe2\x80\x99s still somewhere thousands of miles to the south.'
b'Because there is no tournament of its caliber in Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central and South America, the Miami Open has developed into the de facto Latin American Slam, drawing fans from the region and its diasporas, transforming this Florida fixture into a virtual homecoming for Latino players.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really nice to have the support,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leonardo Mayer, an Argentine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost like playing in Buenos Aires.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The top South American player, Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro of Argentina, missed this year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament because of a knee injury, but fans had to change only one letter in their customary cheer for him in order to root for his compatriot Federico Delbonis, who took a set off top-ranked Novak Djokovic on Sunday. Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cOl\xc3\xa9, ol\xc3\xa9, ol\xc3\xa9, ol\xc3\xa9! Delpo, Delpo!\xe2\x80\x9d they chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cDelbo, Delbo!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Even away from the court, the Miami area\xe2\x80\x99s large Latino population affects the experience of playing in the tournament. Delbonis said he appreciated being able to buy yerba mate leaves in Miami to make his favorite beverage; for most events, he has to travel with his own supply.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I come here I feel like I want to be here, I want to live here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got to the court today, I heard a lot of Argentinians speaking Spanish, cheering in Spanish, and you feel that energy they give you. They give you confidence, and you feel it inside. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for your game to be more happy on court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Monica Puig, who in 2016 won Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s first Olympic gold medal, had vocal support from many Puerto Rican fans in her first-round match on Wednesday, when she lost to Wang Xiyu. She said regretted not being able to play more matches throughout the season in front of that crowd, which included her father.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHaving that Latin American feel here, just buzzing all over the place, it\xe2\x80\x99s really special,\xe2\x80\x9d said Puig, the only Latin American woman ranked in the top 100 in singles.'
b'Even fans from Latin American countries that are not represented among the players make their presence felt. After Fabio Fognini of Italy defeated Guido Andreozzi of Argentina on Friday, a woman unfurled a large Paraguayan flag.'
b'Latin American reporters travel to the Miami Open in droves, with 24 representatives of Argentine news media leading this year\xe2\x80\x99s international contingent, according to the tournament.'
b'Though Latin American fans initially embraced the tournament organically, the event has begun marketing to them directly, including digital advertising in South America in both Spanish and Portuguese, as well as on Spanish-language websites in South Florida. (While Latin food and music can be found on the grounds, all the signs at the Miami Open are in English.)'
b'Players from the United States have to adjust to this rare home tournament where the crowds may not tip in their favor. Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay recalled being stunned in 2011 when fans chanted his country\xe2\x80\x99s name as he upset Andy Roddick, the defending champion and American star, on the stadium court of Key Biscayne.'
b'In one of the last matches played at the old venue in 2018, the American John Isner, the eventual champion, had little support when he met del Potro in the semifinals.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe fans were great, but it was not 50-50,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of Argentinian flags, that country loves their sport, loves their soccer and their tennis. To see all the flags in the crowd, it was a very, very cool atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Many other non-Latin American players similarly relish the passionate crowds.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always played the best in countries and in places where I felt that energy,\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander Zverev of Germany said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Rome I always felt great. Italians are very energetic, powerful people. Madrid, Mexico, Miami: It\xe2\x80\x99s always those kind of places I\xe2\x80\x99ve played well in. For me, I enjoy when the crowd is loud, energetic, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice when this happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dominic Thiem of Austria has won four of his 12 career titles in Latin America \xe2\x80\x94 two in Argentina and one each in Mexico and Brazil.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe energy in these countries and from these people is nice,\xe2\x80\x9d Thiem said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like they are always in a good mood. They are happy to live, I feel. It\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes different in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s the weather, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'James Blake, a former player from the United States who is now the tournament director of the Miami Open, said he had savored his two matches against Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil at the tournament, where American supporters could not match the Brazilians\xe2\x80\x99 boisterousness.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose are a lot of fun, because you\xe2\x80\x99re on the edge of your seat,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery big point, every shot, is exacerbated by the fact that the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s going crazy, and you\xe2\x80\x99re angry at yourself because their crowd is going crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Players are not always comfortable with the din.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some players who don\xe2\x80\x99t love it,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake said, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\xe2\x80\x99ve voiced that to me, plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After she lost to Puig last year, Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark threatened to boycott the tournament, saying her supporters felt threatened by people in the profusely pro-Puig crowd.'
b'Wozniacki did return this year and said she had not discussed the incident with tournament organizers since. Last week she focused on the positives of the partisanship \xe2\x80\x94 like hearing the chants for Delbonis as she played on a nearby court, and being able to quell the noise.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI could hear it was like a soccer-like atmosphere,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cool. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously more fun when they cheer for you. At the same time it\xe2\x80\x99s also fun to quiet the fans. It\xe2\x80\x99s fun when all of a sudden it goes dead quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my Chardy enjoyed silencing the cacophony of Chileans who were raucously supporting his opponent, Nicol\xc3\xa0s Jarry, in their first-round match. After he won, he blew kisses toward the Chilean contingent.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou always know when you play a South American here it will be difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d Chardy said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crowd was difficult all the match, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Just at the end when I won, I wanted to send them kisses, and they replied with some fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Chardy said he appreciated the animated crowd, despite the animus.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it was not always respectful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer when there\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere to no atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'PERTH, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo won her two Grand Slam singles titles in 2006 and retired three years later. She had no idea that Roger Federer, the man who won Grand Slam singles titles on those same weekends as her in 2006, would still be on top of his sport more than a decade later.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he does it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mauresmo said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat it puts on your body is huge. The training, the matches, the travel, the jet lag, anything.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mauresmo and Federer won the Australian Open and Wimbledon singles titles in 2006. Two years older than Federer, Mauresmo, 39, retired from the sport in 2009, at 30, and is at the Australian Open as coach of the French player Lucas Pouille.'
b'Federer is at the Australian Open as the two-time defending champion. His bid for a 21st Grand Slam singles championship begins Monday in Melbourne.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWinning back-to-back Australian Opens like this, in my mid-30s, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of my favorite things I will look back on in my career,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was going to happen, and I had such a great time here in Australia the last couple of years and always enjoyed playing here.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer acknowledges his age readily, quipping at the Hopman Cup recently that his 20-year-old opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, \xe2\x80\x9ccould be my son.\xe2\x80\x9d And he marvels at his own ability to run up the score in the record books \xe2\x80\x94 99 titles and counting \xe2\x80\x94 at an age when many would count him out.'
b'But after an auspicious start to last season, when he won his first 17 matches, Federer seemed to trail off. After winning the title in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in February and briefly reclaiming the No. 1 ranking, Federer went without another tournament championship until October. After skipping the clay-court season for the second year in a row, he lost in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon after holding a match point against Kevin Anderson, and in the fourth round of the United States Open to John Millman.'
b'Federer played down the doomsday talk that accompanied his stagnation in the second half of the year.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was more surprised to hear that there was sort of concern, or people were saying, \xe2\x80\x98What a bad second half to the year.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer conceded disappointing finishes at the Grand Slam events but thought he otherwise played well, including a loss in a third-set tiebreaker to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of the Paris Masters in November.'
b'He said what he needed to do better this year \xe2\x80\x9cis really play well when it really comes down to the crunch.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer said he trusted his own evaluations of his play as well as input from his coaches, Ivan Ljubicic and Severin L\xc3\xbcthi.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can analyze \xe2\x80\x94 with my age, very well \xe2\x80\x94 my own matches and my own feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have two great coaches, two of the best in the game, who give me their fair assessment, and I have a fitness coach who tells me if I\xe2\x80\x99m moving good or not. They\xe2\x80\x99re all open and honest towards me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any sugarcoating; I want it real, and straight. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. I know, always, where I\xe2\x80\x99m at.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very clear in my team where I stand. And from that standpoint, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy where I am right now. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a great position.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mauresmo longs to learn more about what Federer does in his off-seasons.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope one day he will explain to everyone everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little details, everything that he\xe2\x80\x99s put together to be able to play this well at his age, to move this well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer is not exactly clandestine about his routines. He prefers, for example, to do his off-season movement drills on a tennis court, rather than indoors as many players do, to better simulate the footing and friction of match conditions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do a bit of weights, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, grinning and gesturing toward his lithe frame. \xe2\x80\x9cI know we don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, but I do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer started his season auspiciously, winning all eight sets he played at the Hopman Cup last week, never dropping serve in any of the matches.'
b'But he considers the top-ranked Djokovic the clear favorite at the Australian Open. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Melbourne, has won the last two Grand Slam tournaments.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe know who the usual are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Federer, who is seeded third, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m part of that bunch.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The longevity of that oligarchy, which also includes Rafael Nadal, has blocked several younger players from breaking through on tennis\xe2\x80\x99s biggest stages. No player currently younger than 30 has won even a set in a Grand Slam final.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all tired of you guys already, but what can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev, 21, said during the trophy ceremony of the Hopman Cup on Saturday, when he lost to Federer in singles and mixed doubles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning around and looking at Federer, who laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re 30-whatever! Why? Just, why? Let us have one.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'A flash spotted on livestreams was likely caused by the crash of a tiny, fast-moving meteoroid left behind by a comet.'
b'By Robin George Andrews'
b'On Sunday and Monday, those in the Western Hemisphere with clear skies were fortunate enough to see the last total lunar eclipse of the decade. As the moon took on a distinctly redder shade just before midnight Eastern Time, livestreams of the phenomenon showed a flash of light suddenly and briefly emanating from the lunar surface.'
b'Anthony Cook, an astronomical observer at Los Angeles\xe2\x80\x99 Griffith Observatory which streamed the eclipse, thought it could have just been the camera\xe2\x80\x99s random electronic noise. Then astronomers and citizen scientists started to share their detection of the flash on Reddit and Twitter.'
b'The only explanation was that something slammed into the lunar surface and obliterated itself.'
b'[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]'
b'The moon is a multi-billion-year-old library of impact events, with fresh collisions still taking place frequently today. Capturing a lunar impact on video is rare enough, but this event \xe2\x80\x94 a collision during a total lunar eclipse \xe2\x80\x94 may be a first.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard of anyone seeing an impact like this during a lunar eclipse before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sara Russell, a professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum in London.'
b'Dr. Russell said that flashes can only be seen from Earth when the lunar surface is in shadow, which is normally just a few days before and after the new moon. A luminous full moon is anathema to such detections, but a total lunar eclipse, painting our pale celestial companion in darkness, changed that.'
b'Justin Cowart, a graduate student in geosciences at Stony Brook University in New York who spotted the flash, managed to narrow down the impact location. Using images from an amateur astronomer, Christian Fr\xc3\xb6schlin, Mr. Cowart determined that the flash took place somewhere in the lunar highlands, south of Byrgius crater.'
b'NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which studies the moon\xe2\x80\x99s surface, may soon spot the fresh crater. But the impact flash itself can be used to roughly estimate the size of the object that crashed on the moon, and its momentum. Based on NASA and European Space Agency databases of impact flashes, Mr. Cowart guesses that \xe2\x80\x9cit was probably somewhere between the size of an acorn and tennis ball.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Detection data from the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System, or MIDAS, found that the space rock was a pipsqueak of a meteoroid, only weighing something like 22 pounds, and measuring no more than 12 inches across.'
b'The provenance of the meteoroid remains an open question. According to Jose Maria Madiedo, an astrophysicist at the University of Huelva in Spain who is a co-director of the MIDAS system, most objects that hit Earth come from comets and not asteroids, and the same applies to the moon'
b'With that in mind, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most likely situation is that the impactor was a rock from a comet.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Considering its tiny dimensions, it must have been moving at an incredible speed to create a flash of light visible from Earth. Indeed, Dr. Madiedo said that the impact velocity would be in the range of 38,000 miles per hour. That is just over twice the speed that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s old space shuttle had to move after launch to achieve orbit of Earth.'
b'A total lunar eclipse is always something to marvel at, but one being gate-crashed by a hypersonic cometary shard is something else entirely.'
b'An earlier version of this article, using information from an astronomer, misstated where on the moon a flash of light was seen. It was south of the Byrgius crater, not west of Legendre crater.'

b'Andy Murray is not the youngest of the tennis supergroup known as the Big Four. Novak Djokovic was born a week later than Murray was.'
b'But it is still quite an unpleasant surprise to realize that Murray, 31, very likely will be the first of the remarkable quartet to retire.'
b'Roger Federer is somehow still gliding at 37. Rafael Nadal is somehow still persevering at 32.'
b'But Murray has been in too much pain for too long with no relief in view, and on Friday in Melbourne, Australia, all of those who have followed his career from up close or a great distance could share some of his pain, too.'
b'It was not what he said. It was what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.'
b'Murray, like all tennis stars of his stature, has spent as much time in news conferences as most of us have spent at the coffee shop. They are an artificial construct that has become a natural habitat for Murray, a droll, strong-minded Scotsman with the voice that sounds like a low-flying drone \xe2\x80\x94 a voice he once called \xe2\x80\x9cmy least favorite thing about me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But as he sat down behind the table on Friday, his cap pulled low and his lips pursed, reporters placed digital recorders on the table in front him to capture the words. There was soon nothing to capture.'
b'Asked how he and his ailing hip were feeling, he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, not, not great.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He then sighed, averted his glance, dropped his chin, touched the bill of his cap and his face, fought for composure and was unable to utter another word for nearly a minute before finally grabbing his credential off the desk and leaving the room.'
b'Though he soon returned, nothing he explained then was nearly as eloquent as those 45 seconds of silence.'
b'What mattered most was all in there: the sensitivity, the humanity, the competitive fire reduced to anguish at not being able to solve his hip problem despite all the medical expertise, financial resources and iron will at his disposal.'
b'Murray plans to play on, hopefully until Wimbledon this summer, although there are no guarantees. He acknowledged that this Australian Open, which begins Monday, could be the finish line, and surely the poignancy of making such an announcement in Melbourne was not lost on him.'
b'[Update: Andy Murray loses in his first-round match at the Australian Open.]'
b'Sir Andrew Barron Murray has had many triumphs in his 31 years: back-to-back Olympic gold medals and three Grand Slam titles, none more resonant than his winning Wimbledon in 2013 to end a 77-year drought for British men in singles. Many other worthies, including Bunny Austin and Tim Henman, had embarked on the same quest and faltered.'
b'But Australia is where Murray has had to face his own tennis limitations.'
b'He broke down in tears during the awards ceremony after losing the final to Federer in 2010, but though he has, in his own words, \xe2\x80\x9ckept it together\xe2\x80\x9d since then in Melbourne, 2010 was only the beginning of the disappointment. He lost the final again in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016.'
b'No other man has gone 0-5 in singles finals at the same major tournament, and he shares the blame with Djokovic, his one-time doubles partner, who has beaten Murray in the last four of those finals.'
b'So close in age and skill sets, they first played as 13-year-olds at Les Petits As junior tournament in France. Murray won in a hurry, but they have played 36 times as professionals, more than enough to make it clear that Djokovic is the greater player.'
b'He leads their series by 25-11 and has 14 Grand Slam singles titles (and counting). For many, the Big Four has become the Big Three. And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Stan Wawrinka have \xe2\x80\x94 like Murray \xe2\x80\x94 three major titles of his own?'
b'Such arguments have merit: Federer and Nadal also have winning records against Murray, and there is no doubt now that in the final analysis of this golden tennis era, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic will be the central figures and the statistical leaders.'
b'But Murray earned his place in tennis\xe2\x80\x99s great modern foursome, with his week-to-week consistency, his resilience, his all-surface brilliance and his ability to excel at Wimbledon with the equivalent of the Centre Court roof on his shoulders.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever motivated by money, only by his rivals; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t need people\xe2\x80\x99s respect, but he earned it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Petchey, Murray\xe2\x80\x99s former coach, said in the wake of Murray\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.'
b'Murray might not have been here at all. He and his older brother, Jamie, were young students at Dunblane Primary School in their Scottish town in 1996 when a local resident entered the grounds and murdered 16 of their schoolmates and a teacher before shooting himself.'
b'The Murray brothers survived, though not without invisible scars, and they both grew up to become No. 1 in the world: Andy in singles, Jamie in doubles.'
b'That is a tribute to their childhood sibling rivalry, their talent and their work ethic, and also to their formidable tennis mother, Judy, a former Scottish professional player who has been a driving force with her intuition, her ambition, her sharp wit and her informed passion for the game.'
b'Jamie, 32 and still in the top 10 in doubles, plans to play beyond 2019. Andy, at this stage, does not.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a kaleidoscope of talent, of emotion, of movement, spirit and authenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Petchey, a former British player who introduced Murray to Kim Sears, who would become Murray\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a winner, but he became a champion. A champion not just on the court but a champion of causes off it. He leaves as he arrived. Tennis never changed him, but he changed tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray, in part (but only in part) because of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s impact on his career, has been the rare men\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 to speak out frequently in support of gender equality and women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis, whose results he actually seems to follow. He has also walked the walk, hiring a woman as a coach: Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo.'
b'That has endeared him to a wider audience and only underscored the gulf between on-court Murray and off-court Murray. Under pressure and between the lines, he has often been far from endearing: barking at his entourage, using language better suited to the Glasgow docks, and muttering, muttering, muttering as he chased perfection in a sport that refused to cooperate.'
b'Watching him at work, it all has often seemed more a burden than a pleasure. His service motion resembles heavy lifting, and long before his hip problems became career threatening, his walk between points looked closer to a hobble.'
b'But that was before he sensed an opportunity and sprang into action: a short ball he could pounce on for a winner, a wide ball he could chase down that hardly anyone else in the game could have reached.'
b'Murray in his prime was above all a supreme athlete, possessed of quickness, coordination, feathery touch and selective striking power.'
b'As recently as 2016, he had his finest season, winning nine titles and reaching No. 1 for the first time. It still seems premature to believe that he is just about done. After all, retirement in tennis has long been a euphemism for a sabbatical, and one of Murray\xe2\x80\x99s peers who has dealt with pain offered words of encouragement on Friday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t stop trying,\xe2\x80\x9d Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro wrote on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep fighting. I can imagine your pain and sadness. I hope you can overcome this. You deserve to retire on your own terms, whenever that happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Del Potro speaks from experience; multiple wrist operations nearly snuffed out his career. His is a voice to be heeded. But unfortunately so is Murray\xe2\x80\x99s, especially when the emotions are so powerful that the words just won\xe2\x80\x99t come.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Belinda Bencic is making a tricky game look easy at the moment, redirecting her big-swinging opponents\xe2\x80\x99 best shots into the corners, conjuring defensive lobs and flicking reflex returns from inside the baseline.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying not to think who is on the other side of the court,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'But there is no ignoring the quality of her recent tennis victims. From Dubai to Indian Wells, Bencic has been taking on the best in the women\xe2\x80\x99s game and emerging again and again with a broad smile on her face.'
b'On Thursday, she ran her winning streak to 12 matches by defeating her sixth top-10 opponent in less than a month. On Tuesday she had routed Naomi Osaka, the new world No. 1, in little more than an hour at the BNP Paribas Open, but in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s quarterfinal, Bencic met with a great deal more resistance from No. 5 seed Karolina Pliskova before prevailing, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, in 2 hours 16 minutes.'
b'It was a match of fluctuating quality but no shortage of bravura shotmaking in the breeze, Pliskova\xe2\x80\x99s flat power against Bencic\xe2\x80\x99s fast-twitch counterpunching.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think Belinda\xe2\x80\x99s the best in the world at redirecting power, I really do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Joe Fernandez, the ESPN analyst and a former champion at Indian Wells.'
b'That is quite a statement, considering that women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis is full of talented counterpunchers, including the reigning French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, who will face Bencic in the semifinals after defeating Venus Williams, 7-6 (3), 6-3, on Thursday.'
b'But Bencic, a Swiss extrovert who turned 22 on Sunday and is returning to the fore after injury, has long been considered one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s most sparkling talents. She was taught to see the game in full by her father, Ivan, and also by Melanie Molitor, the mother and coach of Martina Hingis, the Swiss wunderkind who rose to No. 1 by treating a tennis court like a chessboard.'
b'Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s tennis star-in-chief, Roger Federer, has played a supportive role in Bencic\xe2\x80\x99s career of late, partnering with her in the Hopman Cup team event and sending encouraging messages.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s worked a lot for this moment, and the big reward is coming now,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got to know her at the Hopman Cup and tried to give her as much advice as I could. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a different game and is in a different stage of her career. Hopefully I helped. But the credit is hers and her team\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Ivan Bencic first became interested in having his daughter play the game, Federer had not yet broken through to the elite level. Hingis was the Swiss player he watched and admired, and their families had more in common than an attraction to tennis. Molitor and Hingis had immigrated to Switzerland from the Slovakian side of the former Czechoslovakia. So had Ivan Bencic, whose family fled the country in 1968 after the Soviet invasion.'
b'Ivan Bencic telephoned Molitor when Belinda was 5 years old and asked her to take a look at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s nascent game. Molitor was impressed enough to offer to help from time to time. It became a much more profound connection after Molitor started her own academy, and Hingis later added her own counsel to the mix.'
b'Though Bencic has more natural power and a more potent serve than her mentor did in her prime, she shares the ability to read tennis tea leaves even in the midst of a fast-paced rally.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe was helping me a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d Bencic said of Hingis, who retired in October 2017 as the world\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 doubles player.'
b'At that stage, Bencic was still coming back from an operation on her left wrist. Though she is right handed, the pain had kept her from hitting her two-handed backhand effectively.'
b'She had appeared to be on a fast train to the top after defeating Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic, Serena Williams and Halep in 2015 at age 18, on her way to the Rogers Cup title in Toronto and to later reaching the top 10.'
b'But her wrist injury changed that career arc, causing her to miss five months in 2017 and fall outside the top 300. She returned at low-level professional tournaments in Europe rather than use a protected ranking and return at the highest level.'
b'Less than two years later, that looks like the right move. There have been some stumbles, but she has found her footing and is guaranteed to re-enter the top 20 on Monday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI played those small events and built my confidence back up with my ranking,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of 2017. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause with the wrist, you never know if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be good or going to hold. You hear so many stories of someone needing a second wrist surgery and then another one, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t great. So definitely the first tournaments, it\xe2\x80\x99s always a test to see if you can keep up. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play a big tournament with all the people right away and have the comeback in the public eye. I definitely needed matches and confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She is getting both in large quantities now. She beat four top-10 players on her way to the title in Dubai last month: Aryna Sabalenka, Halep, Elina Svitolina and Petra Kvitova. She has now beaten Osaka and Pliskova in Indian Wells and, based on level of play, can be considered the favorite for the title.'
b'This is a fascinating, power-shifting phase in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. Osaka, 21, has been the player of the moment for the last six months, winning the singles titles at the 2018 United States Open and this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open.'
b'But fresh threats to the new and fragile order continue to surface. Bianca Andreescu, an 18-year-old Canadian wild card, has reached the semifinals here and has a 25-3 record in tour-level matches this year.'
b'Bencic is not emerging, of course. She is re-emerging, and though it could not have been easy to see players near her age \xe2\x80\x94 such as Osaka and Jelena Ostapenko, the surprise 2017 French Open champion \xe2\x80\x94 claim the biggest trophies, Bencic said that envy was not a driving force.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great that we have so many great players in our age group,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99m much better than her, and she\xe2\x80\x99s winning Grand Slams, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x99 I definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t have this mind-set, because I feel like that person who wins a Grand Slam definitely deserves it. They must be doing something right. It\xe2\x80\x99s only inspiring for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To get her game right this year, Bencic decided to have her father return as her full-time coach for the first time since 2016.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not a coincidence I\xe2\x80\x99m playing the way I\xe2\x80\x99m playing now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'She wanted her freedom in 2016, but believes that they are both on the same wavelength now. And when she was getting edgy against Halep in Dubai, she called her father onto the court for a coaching visit, and he told her to take a moment, look around and appreciate how far she had come.'
b'Her fitness has also improved significantly, something she attributes to maturity and to her Slovakian fitness coach, Martin Hromkovic, a former soccer player who is also her boyfriend.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, it works right now very well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are doing the work, Martin is my coach, and I\xe2\x80\x99m respecting that. But as well I am feeling the support so much, like he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything he can for me and sacrificing really a lot. So I\xe2\x80\x99m super happy to have him by my side.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Naomi Osaka, the half-Haitian, half-Japanese tennis champion, is the star of a new Japanese anime-style advertisement.'
b'The problem? The cartoon Ms. Osaka bears little resemblance to her real, biracial self.'
b'Her skin was unmistakably lightened, and her hair style changed \xe2\x80\x94 a depiction that has prompted criticism in Japan, where she has challenged a longstanding sense of cultural and racial homogeneity.'
b'The ad \xe2\x80\x94 unveiled this month by Nissin, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest instant-noodle brands \xe2\x80\x94 features Ms. Osaka and Kei Nishikori, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s top-ranked male tennis player, in a cartoon drawn by a team commissioned by Nissin. The cartoon was based on the work of Takeshi Konomi, a well-known manga artist whose series \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prince of Tennis\xe2\x80\x9d is popular in Japan.'
b'Ms. Osaka, who faces Elina Svitolina in an Australian Open quarterfinal match on Wednesday, and Mr. Konomi have not publicly commented on the reactions to the ad.'
b'But a Nissin spokesman apologized in an email on Tuesday for \xe2\x80\x9cthe confusion and discomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The spokesman, Daisuke Okabayashi, said that the characters had been developed in line with Mr. Konomi\xe2\x80\x99s anime series and that the company had communicated with Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s representatives.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no intention of whitewashing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe accept that we are not sensitive enough and will pay more attention to diversity issue in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After the ad was first published online, people on social media, including many fans of Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s, said they were deeply disappointed.'
b'Baye McNeil, an author who has lived in Japan for 15 years, said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why the ad would \xe2\x80\x9cerase her black features and project this image of pretty much the prototypical anime girl-next-door character.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ms. Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s rise into a beloved national figure has been particularly exciting for biracial people in Japan, known as hafus, who have long battled for acceptance, he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaking her look white just tells these people that what they are isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McNeil said.'
b'Ms. Osaka was born in Japan to a Haitian-American father and a Japanese mother, and moved to the United States when she was 3. Although she isn\xe2\x80\x99t fluent in Japanese, often responding to questions from Japanese reporters in English, she has tweeted about her love of manga and Japanese movies.'
b'Ranked fourth in the world at just 21, she\xe2\x80\x99s already among Japan\xe2\x80\x99s most accomplished tennis players ever. She became the first Japanese-born tennis player to win a Grand Slam singles championship in September when she defeated Serena Williams in the U.S. Open, a victory that supercharged her celebrity ascent.'
b'That win prompted a cartoon in an Australian newspaper that was criticized for its depiction of Ms. Williams, which many saw as a racist caricature. While most of the condemnation focused on how the Australian cartoonist drew Ms. Williams, critics also noted that Ms. Osaka was depicted with blond hair and light skin.'
b'Black characters aren\xe2\x80\x99t frequently found in anime, but artists in the medium have successfully depicted their skin tones before.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen there is a black character, it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a black character,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McNeil said.'
b'The discussion of biracial identity in Japan got a boost in 2015 when Ariana Miyamoto, who is half-Japanese, half-African-American, won the Miss Universe Japan pageant. She used her fame to discuss the plight of \xe2\x80\x9chafus,\xe2\x80\x9d but some in Japan were unwilling to accept her as a model of Japanese beauty. '
b'In interviews, Ms. Osaka has embraced her multicultural background.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because they can\xe2\x80\x99t really pinpoint what I am,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in 2016, \xe2\x80\x9cso it\xe2\x80\x99s like anybody can cheer for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An earlier version of this article misstated who drew the anime-style advertisement that featured Naomi Osaka with lighter skin. It was a team that Nissin commissioned, not the manga artist Takeshi Konomi, though the ad was based on Mr. Konomi\xe2\x80\x99s work.'

b"MONACO \xe2\x80\x94 Rafael Nadal is unsure how his latest injury return will go this week, even though it will be on the clay-court king's favorite surface."
b'The second-ranked Spaniard is coming back at the Monte Carlo Masters, a tournament he has won a record 11 times along with the French Open and Barcelona.'
b'"It has been a tough year and a half for me, so it\'s tough to have a clear view about how I am," Nadal said Monday at the French Riviera tournament, where he plays Spanish countryman Roberto Bautista Agut in the second round on Wednesday.'
b'"I had too many stops; I didn\'t find a way to play three weeks in a row without problems. So it has been hard for me. When you have these things going on, on the mental side it\'s up and down. It\'s always like a comeback."'
b"Even Toni Nadal, his uncle and former coach, was skeptical about Nadal's long-term future in tennis in an interview with El Pais last month."
b'"Rafael wants to continue playing, despite his physical problems," Toni said. "That is what will continue to be decisive. Until when, who knows? Maybe two or three more years. What I\'m saying is that Rafael is not a tennis player, he\'s an injured person who plays tennis."'
b'Responding on Monday, the 32-year-old Nadal said his uncle had apologized for the comments.'
b'"He came to the court and felt sorry for that. Toni wanted to say it in a positive way because of course I had many issues," Nadal said. "Toni has conferences for companies every week. So when you talk a lot, sometimes you make some mistakes."'
b'Bautista Agut beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic at the Miami Open last month \xe2\x80\x94 where Nadal did not play. His troublesome right knee had flared up again the previous tournament, forcing him to pull out of his semifinal against Roger Federer at Indian Wells.'
b'Nadal resumed practice two weeks ago and his knee is holding up.'
b'"My knee is quite good. Happy for that. Now I need to work on the tennis," he said. "I hope the competition puts me in the rhythm I need."'
b'Nadal usually finds his rhythm quicker than anyone on clay.'
b'Last year, he missed February and March after retiring in the fifth set of his Australian Open quarterfinal against Marin Cilic with a hip injury.'
b'However, it did not stop him reeling off 14 straight wins on clay without dropping a set \xe2\x80\x94 winning two Davis Cup matches, the Monte Carlo and Barcelona titles before Dominic Thiem stopped him in the Madrid Masters quarterfinals.'
b'Nadal went on to win the Rome Masters and French Open and reached the Wimbledon semifinals on grass, losing an epic five-setter to Djokovic.'
b'Then his body let him down, again.'
b'After retiring from the U.S. Open semifinals against Juan Martin del Potro because of a right knee injury, he did not play again last season \xe2\x80\x94 pulling out of the Paris Masters and the season-ending ATP Finals with an abdominal problem.'
b'"I don\'t like to talk about frustration," Nadal said. "Because life has been too good to me to be frustrated."'
b"Nadal has won more than $100 million in prize money and 80 titles, including a record 33 Masters events. His tally of 17 Grand Slams is second to Federer's 20."
b'But nagging doubts persist.'
b'"At some point, even if I appreciate everything this sport has given to me, sometimes it\'s tough to accept when you have problems in a row," he said. "Since the beginning of the season again it has been tough. You need to be strong mentally and keep the passion very high."'
b'But Nadal did manage a lighter note about his uncle\'s "overdramatic" prognosis.'
b'"Being No. 2 in the world, it is maybe difficult to be where I am being an injured person," Nadal said, smiling. "I have more problems than almost the rest of my competitors, but I was able to manage it well all my life."'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Amanda Anisimova is seen by many as the future of American tennis, but she sometimes yearns for a second opinion from a third eye.'
b'She drives by so many psychic readers around her home in South Florida. \xe2\x80\x9cI always want to go in,\xe2\x80\x9d Anisimova, 17, said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m kind of scared, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what my future is going to look like: I want it to be a surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to hear what they have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'No clairvoyance was necessary to see Anisimova\xe2\x80\x99s potential as she dominated 11th-seeded Aryna Sabalenka, 6-3, 6-2, on Friday to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open. That victory made Anisimova the first player born this century to reach the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, and the youngest American to do so since Serena Williams at the 1998 French Open.'
b'Not all forecasts were accurate, however: Before the match began, a Tennis Australia \xe2\x80\x9cWin Predictor\xe2\x80\x9d graphic gave Anisimova only a 9 percent chance of beating Sabalenka, who was a popular pick to win the tournament among many pundits and the oddsmakers\xe2\x80\x99 third favorite behind only Williams and Angelique Kerber.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty rough number \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised by that,\xe2\x80\x9d Anisimova said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s a top player; she\xe2\x80\x99s had such a great year. I was just playing really well, and she was playing really well, too. We had a great match, and it just ended up going my way today.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Anisimova, ranked 87th, is likely to be undaunted by her next opponent: sixth-seeded Petra Kvitova, whom she beat last year in Indian Wells, Calif.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery player here is going to be great, and every round is going to be tough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just focus on myself, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not really scared of anyone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t fear anyone. I just have a lot of confidence in myself, and I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for tough matches.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Although Anisimova\xe2\x80\x99s ability to dictate play against the ultra-aggressive Sabalenka gained more attention, one of her hardest matches came in her first round against the tricky veteran Monica Niculescu, who plays a game chock-full of funky slices that have driven many more established players crazy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a teenager who would have won the first round against Niculescu besides Amanda,\xe2\x80\x9d said her agent, Max Eisenbud. \xe2\x80\x9cThat match, until today\xe2\x80\x99s match, was her most impressive win. The way Niculescu slices and throws everything at you, it was getting tight, and she was able to perform. A crafty, experienced girl who threw everything at her, and she still won in straight sets.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Eisenbud also represents the player to whom Anisimova is most often compared: Maria Sharapova. While he said that comparisons between the two \xe2\x80\x94 blondes with Russian roots who stormed the tennis stage at a young age \xe2\x80\x94 were unfair to both, he observed that Anisimova and Sharapova did share a diligent work ethic and an ability not to be fazed in the biggest moments.'
b'Frances Tiafoe, who also reached the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time on Friday, gushed over Anisimova, in his own way.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like she\xe2\x80\x99s been a veteran,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going out here, and Sabalenka is playing great tennis \xe2\x80\x94 she routined her like it was nothing. It was barbecue chicken for her. It\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In her news conference Friday, Anisimova said that her confidence was growing.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in myself so much more than I ever did in this tournament,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just trusting myself. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I have been also playing really well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That confidence leads her to hope she can follow in Sharapova\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps in another way: by becoming a Grand Slam champion as a teenager. Asked what her dream was for her career, Anisimova expressed a desire for instant gratification.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to win this tournament \xe2\x80\x94 right now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling.'
b'Anisimova, who broke through at the junior level by winning the 2017 United States Open girls\xe2\x80\x99 title, complements her desire for immediacy with an uncommon curiosity about the past, expressing her admiration for Billie Jean King, the pioneer who played a formative role in getting women\xe2\x80\x99s professional tennis off the ground.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBack then it was so different and so difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d Anisimova said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much she worked, it was just crazy. Everything that she was doing just really surprised me. And that\xe2\x80\x99s something also I remember: I tell myself I\xe2\x80\x99m tired after an easy day \xe2\x80\x94 then seeing how much stuff she was doing? It was amazing how much she\xe2\x80\x99s done for the WTA and women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Modern issues are also a concern for Anisimova. She was particularly affected by the shooting last February that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., near where she trains.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not in a little tennis bubble,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gun thing, it was so close to home. I know a girl who goes to that school, so it was just very scary. I just thought at the time \xe2\x80\x94 and I still think to this day \xe2\x80\x94 that guns are very dangerous and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be having them, using them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Anisimova was born in Freehold, N.J., but drew a blank when asked about the town\xe2\x80\x99s most famous export. \xe2\x80\x9cWait \xe2\x80\x94 Bruce who?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he, like, old?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After a few bars of \xe2\x80\x9cBorn in the U.S.A.\xe2\x80\x9d were hummed and a brief description was provided, Anisimova acknowledged some faint recognition of Bruce Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s work but said it was unfair to expect more from someone born in 2001.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chow am I supposed to know that?\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'While Caroline Wozniacki and Roger Federer aim to defend their singles titles in Melbourne, some younger players have shown signs that they can make a run. '
b'By Geoff Macdonald'
b'Khachanov, a 22-year-old Russian, began 2018 ranked 45th in the world and enters the Australian Open as the No. 10 seed. He gave Rafael Nadal all he could handle in a hugely entertaining four-set match in the third round of the United States Open, and then won the Paris Masters  by defeating four straight top-10 opponents: John Isner, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and top-ranked Novak Djokovic. Khachanov, who is 6-foot-5, has a huge serve and a Western forehand with a long, flowing backswing that suddenly accelerates at the ball, giving the impression that he is a cracking whip. It makes the shot nearly impossible to read. '
b'Coric, 22, has not won a match in four previous trips to the Australian Open, but he had an extraordinary 2018: reaching a career-high ranking of 12th,  defeating Roger Federer twice and, with Marin Cilic, leading Croatia to its second Davis Cup title. A left-hander by nature who plays right-handed, Coric is 6-2 with a game that has evolved from a defensive, counterpunching style to a more aggressive, opportunistic brand of tennis. He has developed a superb serve, and his return of serve puts enormous pressure on his opponent. His two-handed backhand is considered one of the best in the game. His forehand, once a liability, is much improved. '
b'Medvedev, a 22-year-old Russian,  rose from No. 65 to No. 16 in the world in 2018 and attributes his ascent to a better serve and more control of his temper. He won in Tokyo in October with dominant serving, dropping just one set as he captured his third tour title. Last week, he reached the final in Brisbane with wins over Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, then lost in three sets to a resurgent Kei Nishikori. A lanky 6-6, Medvedev does not look powerful, but he hits the ball cleanly with perfect timing and with great disguise. He can serve bombs and also hit wide serves with a spin that opens up the court for his second shot. '
b'Sabalenka, a 20-year-old from Belarus, opened her 2019 season with a stirring three-set victory over Alison Riske to win the Shenzhen Open. Sabalenka began 2018 ranked 73rd, but under the tutelage of Dmitry Tursunov, a former tour player, she has risen to No. 11 by harnessing her prodigious power game and staying in points longer with improved shot selection. Her breakthrough came in the Cincinnati event in August, when she reached the semifinals with wins over Johanna Konta, Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Garcia and Madison Keys. She followed that by winning the Connecticut Open in New Haven, and then upsetting Petra Kvitova to reach the fourth round at the United States Open. The 6-foot Sabalenka serves with power and heavy spin, backing that up with a fearsome Western forehand. But what really makes her a threat is the way she plays fearlessly in the big moments of a close match.'
b'Barty, a 22-year-old Australian, had a breakout season in 2018, winning her first Grand Slam doubles title at the United States Open (with CoCo Vandeweghe), and reaching a career-high singles ranking of 15th. In Sydney last week, she upset world No. 1 Simona Halep in straight sets. Barty has an exceptional all-court game, using her athleticism and wide array of shots to confound opponents. Although she is only 5-5, Barty leads the WTA Tour in second serve points won, using her heavy kick serve to pull the returner out of position and then attacking the first ball with her powerful forehand. With her superb volleys and overhead, Barty looks to attack the net, often approaching behind her one-handed slice backhand, which is considered the best in the game. Expect the Australian fans to turn Barty\xe2\x80\x99s matches into rollicking events.'
b'Keys, a 23-year-old American who was the runner-up to Sloane Stephens in singles at the 2017 United States Open, last year reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, as well as the semifinals of the French Open and the United States Open. But her other results were somewhat lackluster, and she enters this week ranked 17th. Keys struggled to find a coach to replace Lindsay Davenport, who stopped traveling to spend more time with her family. In December, Keys hired Jim Madrigal, who guided Tennys Sandgren on his run to the quarterfinals in Melbourne a year ago. At 5-10, Keys has one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s best first serves, and she generates astonishing pace with her ground strokes. But she ranks only 27th on tour in second serve points won, at just over 47 percent. An improvement in this area could pay off for Keys. '

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Deservedly No. 1 in the world at age 21, Naomi Osaka has not made it past the round of 16 in her first two tournaments wearing the crown.'
b'After stumbling at the first hurdle in Dubai last month, she won two matches here in Indian Wells before running into Belinda Bencic.'
b'Though it is too early to start scurrying around the halls and sounding the alarms, it is not too early to observe that Osaka is in the midst of an adjustment process that could take more time to work through than she imagined.'
b'In a little more than six months, the Japanese-American with Haitian roots has become a multicultural star with global reach, fired the coach who helped her zoom to No. 1 by winning two Grand Slam singles titles in a row, and hired a new coach who had yet to be a head coach at this level.'
b'It is a lot to handle, a lot to digest, particularly with people like me poised to parse every performance for signs of trouble.'
b'Bencic gave her plenty to digest, beating Osaka at her own game on Tuesday by taking time and the initiative away as she ended Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s title defense in just 66 minutes in the round of 16 by the no-argument score of 6-3, 6-1.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNaomi was rushed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to dictate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris Evert, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Naomi had come across a player like that. All these big hitters like Aryna Sabalenka, and even Serena, are not that close to the baseline. They are two or three feet back. But Bencic plays an entirely different game, and she played a flawless match. She\xe2\x80\x99s back, very back.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The proof is in her 11-match winning streak, which includes a title in Dubai and five victories over top-10 players. Born in 1997, the same year as Osaka, Bencic has the skills to challenge her often in the seasons to come if she can keep her head and health together. Bencic will play fifth-seeded Karolina Pliskova in the quarterfinals on Thursday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think at a time like this with that score line, I would usually feel very depressed and sad,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said at her surprisingly upbeat post-match news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I feel pretty good right now, because I think given the circumstances I tried my best, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any regrets. I tried to be positive throughout the entire match. Honestly, she was just playing so well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was not Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s first look at Bencic, who turned 22 this month. They first played in a small-money event in Alabama on clay in 2013, and Osaka beat Bencic, 6-3, 6-3, which came as a shock considering that Bencic already was a highly regarded junior player from Switzerland and that Osaka had barely played junior tennis at all.'
b'But there was no catching Bencic by surprise on Tuesday. She already had beaten Osaka in straight sets at the 2018 Hopman Cup team event, which is technically an exhibition. And after reaching the top 10 in 2016 and then dropping back because of wrist surgery, she is playing with the point-by-point focus of someone who knows that tennis success, with all its trappings, is not a given.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know how frustrating it was when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to play at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Bencic said, sounding sage beyond her years.'
b'Osaka sounds a bit wiser herself. The meandering, sometimes cryptic interviews of 2018 have given way to something more considered and open with occasional dashes of her trademark whimsy.'
b'This is not a coincidence. She watched clips of her past news conferences and did not like some of what she saw: the \xe2\x80\x9cums,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9clikes.\xe2\x80\x9d At this new stage, she greets questions, of which there are many, with respect, giving the impression that she is weighing each one before answering.'
b'Asked to compare herself now with when she won Indian Wells as an unseeded player in 2018, she gave another measured response, even in defeat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI guess one of the biggest things is I wanted to be more mature,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like this is something I\xe2\x80\x99m still working on \xe2\x80\x94 on and off the court. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest goals that I have had in my entire life.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI might have thrown a few tantrums last year,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this year it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I\xe2\x80\x99m working on improving, and I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s going well. I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just more confident in myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dismissing Sascha Bajin, her silken-voiced German coach, was certainly a bold move. Under his guidance, she defeated Serena Williams, Bajin\xe2\x80\x99s former employer, twice in 2018: once in the first round in Miami and once under much more duress in the United States Open final. With Bajin still by her side, but apparently no longer in her confidence, Osaka fought through another rough-and-tumble draw to win the Australian Open in January.'
b'Neither has explained their split in detail, although Osaka has said it was not a matter of money. She or some members of her team were looking for a lower-profile coach, but there were clearly personal issues at work, too.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomething happened that must not have been good, although that\xe2\x80\x99s just speculation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Evert, who often watched Osaka and Bajin train in Boca Raton, Fla. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were laughing and having fun practices and teasing each other, and it was great, and then just before the Australian and after the Australian, it was tense.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Bajin is gone now, replaced by Jermaine Jenkins, a former standout at Clemson University who spent several years as the main hitting partner for Venus Williams, who dismissed her coach, David Witt, and Jenkins in the off-season.'
b'Jenkins was quickly hired as a national coach by the United States Tennis Association to work out of its national campus in Orlando. He was just settling in when he got a text message from Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Stuart Duguid, inquiring about his availability.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had a great new gig at the U.S.T.A., and I was doing my expense report and I get that text message,\xe2\x80\x9d Jenkins said with a chuckle this week. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a great adventure is offered to you, you cannot refuse it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Jenkins, 34, knows full well that job security at this level is fragile, which is one of the big reasons he was drawn to the U.S.T.A. post.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife and I live there in Lake Nona,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlus, with the coaching carousel, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back out with another player and then they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and say, \xe2\x80\x98Hey I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling this.\xe2\x80\x99 I was thinking more about security because there are only a few, I feel like, out there that are worth being out here for.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka, with her talent and star power, is certainly on that short list, and she and Jenkins are now 2-1 after their first tournament together, which included one on-court coaching visit that Osaka jokingly began by suggesting she was having a midlife crisis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to break the ice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Keeping the mood light and keeping tennis in perspective seem like the right idea when there are all sorts of new and powerful forces at work, including celebrity and megamillions.'
b'This also seems a good time for Osaka to remember that the controlled power and controlled emotion that she displayed to win in New York and again in Australia were anything but a fluke.'
b'An earlier version of this article misstated when Belinda Bencic beat Naomi Osaka in straight sets at the Hopman Cup. It was in 2018, not this January.'

b'On March 2 in Dubai, Roger Federer joined Jimmy Connors as the only male tennis players in the open era with 100 career titles. With a victory on Sunday over John Isner in the final of the Miami Open, Federer, 37, is now eight titles behind Connors\xe2\x80\x99s record of 109. '
b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a look at Federer\xe2\x80\x99s 101 titles.'
b'The date Federer won his first career title, at age 19, in Milan, defeating Julien Boutter of France, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4. Federer was ranked 27th at the time, Boutter 67th. Boutter reached only two finals on the ATP Tour, winning one, and reached a career-high ranking of 46th. His last tour event was Wimbledon in 2004, a tournament Federer won. (The Milan tournament no longer exists.)'
b'Number of Grand Slam titles \xe2\x80\x94 eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the United States Open and one at the French Open. His most recent came at the 2018 Australian Open.'
b'The number of times he has won the tournaments in Halle, Germany, and his hometown, Basel, Switzerland \xe2\x80\x94 his most of any events. '
b'Number of titles on hard courts, most of any surface. (Hard courts are the most common surface on tour.) He has won 18 tournaments on grass and 11 on clay. His first title, in Milan, is one of only two on indoor carpet.'
b'Most titles in one year, in 2006. The first came against Ga\xc3\xabl Monfils in Doha, Qatar, in January; the last against James Blake at the Masters Cup, the former name of the year-end finals, in Shanghai in November.'
b'The only year since 2001 in which Federer has not won a tournament. He sustained a knee injury in January and shut down his season in late July in order to fully recover. '
b'Number of countries in which Federer has won a title, including Japan, Qatar, Sweden, Canada, Portugal, Turkey and the Netherlands. '
b'Number of different opponents, from 25 different countries, who Federer defeated in finals \xe2\x80\x94 including Novak Djokovic, Jiri Novak, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Mark Philippoussis, Andre Agassi, Igor Andreev, David Nalbandian and Nikolay Davydenko. Twenty-five of those opponents are now retired, according to the ATP. '
b'Number of times he has beaten Rafael Nadal in a final, most of any opponent. Who\xe2\x80\x99s No. 2? Andy Roddick, with seven. '
b'Number of times he won a tournament final in straight sets. '
b'Length of his shortest title-clinching win, a 6-2 6-2 victory over David Goffin in Basel in 2014.'
b'Length of his longest title-clinching win, a 5-7, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 3-6, 16-14 victory over Roddick in the 2009 Wimbledon final. The victory gave Federer his 15th major title, breaking Pete Sampras\xe2\x80\x99s record.'
b'His lowest ranked opponent in a final, but it was a familiar name. On Oct. 2, 2005, Federer, then 24, defeated 18-year-old Andy Murray, 6-3 7-5, in the final of the Thailand Open in Bangkok. It was the first of 25 career meetings between the two, and the first ATP Tour final of Murray\xe2\x80\x99s career. '
b'Number of times Federer defeated Ivan Ljubicic in a tournament final. Ljubicic, 40, is now one of Federer\xe2\x80\x99s coaches. '
b'Number of times Federer has lost in a tournament final, missing a chance to add to his trophy case. '

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see that these past two weeks at the Australian Open have been nothing more than a warm-up for Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.'
b'Maybe we should have kept from wasting time on the men\xe2\x80\x99s side and gone straight to the showcase, the final on Sunday, when two titans will revive their rivalry and battle once again for the Australian Open crown.'
b'The question of who would meet in the final became clear on Friday evening, as Djokovic cruised past the French underdog Lucas Pouille, winning, 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.'
b'It was a demolition both thorough and brief, and it mirrored what Nadal had done in his final four clash the night before, when he dismantled fast-rising Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece.'
b'Nadal took 106 minutes, lightning fast for a match at that stage of a Grand Slam. Djokovic versus Pouille lasted only 83 minutes, with Djokovic riding his precision groundstrokes and feline quickness to the win.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect match for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic described it. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the first to the last point.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He looked calmly self-assured as he said this \xe2\x80\x94 nothing like the doubtful athlete who struggled through a nasty elbow injury and upset losses in Melbourne in 2017 and 2018, during the one confounding low period in his career. His performance on Friday had a transcendent quality, he said, and he called such a feeling \xe2\x80\x9cdivine\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin the zone, where everything flows so effortlessly and you are executing everything you are intending to execute.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added that the semifinal was one of the best matches he had played on the sea blue center court at Rod Laver Arena.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s saying a lot.'
b'He was speaking, after all, of the court on which he will soon be aiming for a record seventh Australian Open title; of the court on which he won the first of his 14 major titles, when he beat another French player, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in 2008.'
b'It is also the court where he played one of the most stirring, and still the longest, Grand Slam finals in tennis history: the 5-hour-53-minute war of wills he won against Nadal in 2012, one of the greatest matches ever played, after which both players struggled to stay upright at the trophy ceremony.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic cracked, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t go that long this time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'You never know.'
b'Djokovic brawling against Nadal for the 53rd time \xe2\x80\x94 Djokovic leads, 27-25 \xe2\x80\x94 is expected to scintillate. It may awaken memories of when the two were younger, fresher, but not necessarily better, versions of what they are today, when they seem far and away the two best on the planet, their old rivals diminished or injured or close to retirement, their new rivals not ready yet.'
b'For sports fans in the United States, this is one of those events worth setting the clock for, a match scheduled to start at the very uncivilized time of 3:30 a.m. Eastern on Sunday.'
b'Just as in the run-up to the 2012 final, the Serb, Djokovic, is ranked No. 1 in the world, and the Spaniard, Nadal, is No. 2 and nipping at his heels.'
b'But seven years on, they are also very different. The Nadal of Melbourne 2019 is riding a game he has clearly modified for this event \xe2\x80\x94 a change made, he has acknowledged, as an adaptation to being 32.'
b'Here, at a tournament in which he has not lost a single set, he is looking to keep his legs spry, his troublesome knees healthy. He is hitting more balls on the short hop, sticking closer to the baseline, volleying more. He has also streamlined his service motion, cutting fat from his windup in a search for more accuracy and greater pop.'
b'Djokovic can see the difference. Speaking of the man he described as his primary rival (take that, Roger Federer), Djokovic noted that the changes were working for Nadal.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s backing his first shot up with that great serve, saving energy, and then he can go for more in the return game,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith everything he possesses, all the qualities in his game, adding a lot of free points on the serve makes him much tougher to play against.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Both players have had to adapt, had to overcome recent difficulty, to get to this point. Nadal arrived in Melbourne with low expectations, having taken a hiatus from the tour after last fall\xe2\x80\x99s United States Open, where he withdrew in the semifinals, citing a leg injury. In November, he had ankle surgery.'
b'Dogged by his injured elbow at last year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open, Djokovic was routed in the quarterfinals by Hyeon Chung, a South Korean ranked No. 58 at the time. That loss was one of a batch of stunning upsets he suffered in major championships after winning the French Open in 2016. Plenty of questions were swirling around him at the time. He often wore a hangdog, puzzled look on his face during matches, where once there had been nothing but ice-cold surety.'
b'Would he ever return to form?'
b'But then, last summer, after elbow surgery and a remodeling of his priorities and his coaching team, the old Djokovic emerged. His health returned. So, too, did his steel-trap resolve. He won Wimbledon, beating Nadal in a five-set marathon that Djokovic credited here with giving \xe2\x80\x9ca different, more confident self.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Later in the summer, he won his 14th Grand Slam at a sweltering U.S. Open, tightening his grip on the top of the men\xe2\x80\x99s rankings.'
b'Now he finds himself again in a Melbourne final, with a chance to repeat the glory of 2012, a chance for a 15th Grand Slam, just two behind the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s haul of 17, within striking distance of Federer, who sits at 20 for most in a career.'
b'At his postmatch news conference, I asked Djokovic to imagine a future conversation with his two children, who were not yet born seven years ago, and how he would describe that last epic Melbourne night against Nadal.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow would I describe it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pausing before adding a touch of humor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll probably not have them sit down and watch it because I don\xe2\x80\x99t like my children to watch TV that long.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Then he grew serious.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would probably present it in more a general concept of our rivalry. That match would be icing on the cake.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On Sunday, seeking a seventh Australian Open title, he will have the chance to add more icing, indeed a whole extra layer, to that cake, to the legacy of a glorious career.'
b'An earlier version of this article misidentified the tournament Novak Djokovic won in 2016 before suffering a batch of upsets in major tournaments. It was the French Open, not Wimbledon.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 The reigning United States Open champion, Naomi Osaka, was serving to extend her third-round match against Hsieh Su-Wei when she rolled her right foot while running for a ball and tumbled to the ground, prompting the chair umpire to ask if she was O.K.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka replied, but she was laughing.'
b'Osaka, 21, who was born in Japan and is based in Florida, had already squared herself once, picking her game up after dropping the first set and falling behind 2-4, 0-40 in the second against Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s Hsieh, a big-seed slayer with a bedeviling slice.'
b'By rising to hold off Hsieh 5-7, 6-4, 6-1, Osaka showed that she is more than O.K. She proved that she is maturing in front of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s eyes like a Polaroid picture.'
b'Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s round of 16 opponent is Anastasija Sevastova, whom she defeated in three sets \xe2\x80\x94 after dropping the first \xe2\x80\x94 in the quarterfinals of a tuneup event in Brisbane two weeks ago. Osaka struggled with her composure early on against Sevastova in what turned out to be a prelude to a hissy fit.'
b'In a straight-sets semifinal loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Osaka came unstrung. She committed 26 unforced errors, was broken three times and sulked between shots in a display that she apologized for later on her Twitter account.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHad the worst attitude on the court today,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cSorry to everyone that watched. I keep telling myself to be more mature but seems it\xe2\x80\x99ll take a while.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fast forward to Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne two weeks later. In the first set against Hsieh, Osaka produced 20 unforced errors and was broken three times. So upset was Osaka by her start that she kicked her racket on the changeover before the second set, an act of petulance that resulted in her receiving a code violation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I would have preferred not to do that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really sorry that I did,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut hopefully I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn from that moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It seemed that Osaka had learned nothing from Brisbane when she stood five points from defeat. But a funny thing happened on her way to another dispiriting result. Osaka laughed at her plight, and that moment of mirth acted like a release valve, letting out all the pressure that had been building since she dispatched Serena Williams in straight sets in New York to win her first major title.'
b'Instead of feeling, as she put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat either I win the match or I die,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka relaxed and started playing calmer, smarter points, blasting her way into the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s second week.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe was just playing so well,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said, referring to Hsieh, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think I got overwhelmed. And then early in the second set I tried doing things that I know isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily my game, like I was trying to hit higher balls and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even practice doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She added, \xe2\x80\x9cThen after a while, I just started thinking that I\xe2\x80\x99m in a Grand Slam. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sad; I\xe2\x80\x99m playing against a really great player so I should just enjoy my time and try and put all my energy into doing the best that I can on every point.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In both her title runs in 2018, at Indian Wells and Flushing Meadows, Osaka won every first set. Her overall record last year when she lost the first set was 2-19. So she is pleased to have already posted two victories, against Sevastova and Hsieh, this month after slow starts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the more matches that I play like this, the tougher ones, then maybe as I go on it won\xe2\x80\x99t seem as hard,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy with how I fought. For me, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest things I always thought I could improve, because it sort of seems like before I would accept defeat in a way.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hsieh presented a stout test because the bigger the stage, the better she seems to play. At last year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament, Hsieh upset the third-seeded Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza and the former women\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska before taking the former champion and ex-women\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 1 Angelique Kerber to three sets.'
b'But as Osaka showed against Serena Williams in their U.S. Open final, she too embraces the big stage. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the most attention during Grand Slams, and more people come out than anywhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo definitely it makes me really happy, and I try to sort of channel that in my tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Osaka is home, she trains at the academy in Boca Raton, Fla., run by the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Chris Evert and her brother, John.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said, referring to Evert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I do see her, she always comes up and says a lot of encouraging words, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really grateful for her.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows danced as she divulged a secret. Whatever advice Evert offers, Osaka absorbs it without question. For some reason, she added slyly, her coach, Sascha Bajin, and Evert can say the exact same thing, but it really resonates when Evert says it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I\xe2\x80\x99m, like, ragging on Sascha,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said, grinning, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it feels like I should listen to her more in a way because \xe2\x80\x94 oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get so much hate \xe2\x80\x94 I have seen what she did and she\xe2\x80\x99s also played. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more believable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Before the tournament began, Evert described Osaka as \xe2\x80\x9creliable.\xe2\x80\x9d And here Osaka is, right on schedule, two victories from a potential rematch with Williams in the semifinals.'
b'Reliable? Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s believable.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 To show a fuller picture of the sport, women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis is shining the spotlight on the coaches who travel the tour with its players.'
b'For 10 years, the WTA has allowed on-court coaching at regular tour events. At this year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open, coaches have given news conferences of their own, following their players to the podium after matches. Last season, for the first time, the WTA awarded a Coach of the Year Award, which went to Naomi Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s coach, Sascha Bajin.'
b'But nothing drew more attention to tennis coaches than one getting in trouble. Coaching during a match is not allowed at Grand Slam tournaments, and Serena Williams was assessed a code violation in the women\xe2\x80\x99s final at the United States Open in September when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, spotted her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing toward her from his seat. His hand movements were replayed as much as any shot from the tournament.'
b'Williams\xe2\x80\x99s ire over the penalty, which she felt was akin to calling her a cheater, set off a series of penalties that overshadowed the match, which was won by Osaka.'
b'Afterward, Mouratoglou admitted to making the signals, but added, \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is doing it, 100 percent of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Four months later, at the Australian Open, he continued to insist that the rules should change because coaching from the stands is already \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely tolerated \xe2\x80\x94 except for one or two people who think they\xe2\x80\x99re different.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ramos is officiating matches at this tournament, but he was not assigned to one featuring Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. At least one prominent player \xe2\x80\x94 the men\xe2\x80\x99s semifinalist Stefanos Tsitsipas \xe2\x80\x94 has been cited for illegal coaching in Melbourne.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it should become legal because we stop hypocrisy, first of all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mouratoglou said. \xe2\x80\x9cSecond, because it\xe2\x80\x99s great for the show, and we want to have viewers who are not 50 years old. We want to attract the young generation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not. Tennis is not attracting the young people. And third, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the players.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Despite the WTA\xe2\x80\x99s calling for coaching to be allowed across the sport after the incident at the U.S. Open, neither the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour nor the Grand Slam tournaments have moved in that direction.'
b'Steve Simon, the WTA chief executive, said that coaches \xe2\x80\x9ccontribute an integral element to the on-court and off-court WTA story.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Simon\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors have seen coaches as resources for enriching its product before. Allowing on-court coaching 10 years ago was motivated more by entertainment considerations than any desire for improving tactics.'
b'Larry Scott, then the tour\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, said the rule change came from a desire for \xe2\x80\x9cbeing as fan-friendly as possible and being as responsive to television as possible without altering the fundamentals of the sport.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Holding news conferences with coaches is part of an initiative spearheaded by the tour\xe2\x80\x99s communications manager, Chase Altieri, who came to the WTA in 2017 after working in the N.F.L., where coaches\xe2\x80\x99 briefings have long been a feature of news media coverage.'
b'WTA coaches have embraced the program, both for the chance to articulate their views and to ease the burden on their players. Bajin has made television appearances in lieu of Osaka to lighten her schedule of obligations during tournaments.'
b'A new section of the WTA website includes profiles of the coaches, with details like their current and previous partnerships and off-court interests. Simon said the goal was to \xe2\x80\x9cbring our fans inside our sport.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In recent years, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open have begun with allowing coaching during the qualifying rounds, with players able to walk to the side of the court where their coach is sitting during changeovers if they desire a consultation.'
b'Mouratoglou is one of the strongest advocates for on-court coaching, even though his player never uses it. He said Williams\xe2\x80\x99s sense of self-reliance was a weapon he would not dare muzzle.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that her No. 1 quality is to be the best competitor ever, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to think that suddenly she needs someone to be a better competitor; that would make her weaker,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, for me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for someone like her.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mouratoglou, who has worked with Williams since 2012, owns a tennis academy that bears his name in France and has been a television analyst for ESPN and Eurosport. He said tennis had many untapped areas that could be mined for entertainment purposes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCoaching is part of the game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you show it, it\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible adventure for the people to see.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Before the Australian Open began, Mouratoglou even released a mobile game, Tennis Manager, which offers users the chance to simulate recruiting, training and strategizing with tennis players. Its slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cShape a Champion; Become a Legend.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Bajin, who worked alongside Mouratoglou for years when he was Williams\xe2\x80\x99s hitting partner, comes down on the opposite side of the coaching debate, saying the rule should not be changed \xe2\x80\x9cto make it more interesting\xe2\x80\x9d to watch tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it takes away the purity that tennis was,\xe2\x80\x9d Bajin said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father put me out there on the court in order to become more independent, to learn how to handle problems, to learn how to be by myself, so that nobody can help me \xe2\x80\x94 and I think that still parents do that for their kids. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they want them to start this sport, because it\xe2\x80\x99s something special, and I wish we would keep it that way.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But Bajin admitted that he, too, had occasionally tried to send illicit advice from the stands.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you try to sneak something by,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m guilty of that.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Dylan Alcott, a Grand Slam champion in wheelchair tennis, is a celebrity in his native Australia, extending his influence far beyond the court. '
b'By Ben Rothenberg'
b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 It can take a long time for Dylan Alcott, a paraplegic 28-year-old from a nearby suburb, to maneuver his wheelchair from one place to another around the Australian Open.'
b'He\xe2\x80\x99s not slow; he\xe2\x80\x99s just popular.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople used to stare at me when I was growing up because I was in a wheelchair, and I hated it,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow they\xe2\x80\x99re staring at me because they know me. How amazing is that? It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s Dylan!\xe2\x80\x99 Not, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a guy in a wheelchair.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After first gaining recognition for winning a 2008 Paralympic gold medal in wheelchair basketball at 17, Alcott has come to dominate the quad division of wheelchair tennis, winning seven Grand Slam singles titles, including five at the Australian Open. He won his fifth in a row here on Saturday at Rod Laver Arena, which seats 15,000.'
b'Quad tennis is a small and obscure world, often featuring only four players at major tournaments. But Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s visibility extends far beyond the reach of a tennis stadium. He is the face of ANZ, a bank that is one of the Open\xe2\x80\x99s major sponsors, and appears in advertisements around the grounds and on television. Alcott also served as a courtside analyst for Nine, the Australian network that broadcasts the tournament. During the rest of the year, he works as a radio host for national music stations.'
b'When the broadcaster Gerard Whateley introduced Alcott at a meet-and-greet event on Monday, he made it clear Alcott needed no introduction: \xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir, are inescapable!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Being seen and heard as much as possible is a mission in itself for Alcott.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a kid and I was getting bullied at school and I was really upset, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone like me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone like me on the TV or on the radio or the newspaper, and that sucks! That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. '
b'Alcott said he did not grasp the power of his celebrity until his commercials began to air last year.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe got videos of a little kid in a wheelchair, and every time the ad comes on, he rolls over to the TV and hugs it, because he saw someone like him on TV,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe get hundreds like that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s so cool.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The attention can be exhausting, especially in the midst of competing in a Grand Slam event. Everywhere he goes around Melbourne, people stop, turn and smile in recognition. Though it can eat up hours of his day, Alcott swerves toward those people, rather than away from them, introducing himself and offering to take a photograph.'
b'Alcott also has savored the acceptance of his fellow athletes with whom he has shared the locker room, especially the Australian ones who he sees year-round at Melbourne Park. Last Saturday, Alcott chatted with the 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer at the net when their sessions overlapped on a practice court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like you\xe2\x80\x99re just one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey treat me so well, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. It\xe2\x80\x99s cool, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any other wheelchair athletes have that. They say, \xe2\x80\x98Hi,\xe2\x80\x99 and it\xe2\x80\x99s like they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know you\xe2\x80\x99re in a wheelchair.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'They do notice Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s popularity. Even Stefanos Tsitsipas, who became the Open\xe2\x80\x99s breakthrough star when he beat Federer in the fourth round, deferred to Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI introduced myself to Tsitsipas,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said, \xe2\x80\x9cand he said, \xe2\x80\x98Mate, you\xe2\x80\x99re the most famous guy here, of course I know who you are!\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that. That\xe2\x80\x99s surreal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kris Dent, an executive with the International Tennis Federation, said Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s appeal transcended sports.'
b" \xe2\x80\x9cYou can't fail to notice that when you come to Australia,\xe2\x80\x9d Dent said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe's become much more than just an athlete. It's a phenomenal story that he has.\xe2\x80\x9d "
b'The top-ranked man in able-bodied tennis, Novak Djokovic, has tried his skills in a wheelchair across the net from Alcott, which he said made him appreciate the challenge and the craft of the discipline.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDylan deserves the popularity,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very great guy, very charismatic. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before, these guys are heroes to me, they really are. They make the game of tennis more beautiful and more unique because of what they do and how they do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After winning Paralympic gold medals in singles and doubles in 2016, Alcott was presented Tennis Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Newcombe Medal, which goes annually to the country\xe2\x80\x99s top player. Alcott said winning an award in a general category rather than one designated for disabled athletes \xe2\x80\x9cfelt like breaking through.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Alcott was born with lipomeningocele, which caused a large tumor against his spinal cord. He underwent his first of many surgeries at five weeks old. Health struggles continued throughout his childhood, with his ability to use his extremities worsening at times, both gradually and suddenly.'
b'In 2012, an inebriated acquaintance tried to pick up his chair and dumped him onto the floor, which was covered in broken glass; Alcott severed an artery in his hand in the fall, damaging his ability to use his right hand fully, which is one of the reasons he competes in the quad division. That spelled the end of his wheelchair basketball career and led him to focus on tennis, which he had started playing around age 9 or 10.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest thing is being really proud of my disability, which is kind of different,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. I always say, \xe2\x80\x98Nah, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about it, openly and all the time.\xe2\x80\x99 People buy into that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Though frank and candid about his challenges, Alcott also has tried to share the fullness of his life. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople that have a car accident think their life is over, because road safety ads say, \xe2\x80\x98If you drink and drive and end up in a wheelchair, your life\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x99 as a deterrence,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople look at me and think it\xe2\x80\x99s the same.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why in his autobiography, \xe2\x80\x9cAble,\xe2\x80\x9d a best seller published last fall, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI talk about the first time I had sex, when I travel, everything. To be given the platform to do that, that\xe2\x80\x99s so cool.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The platform for Alcott\xe2\x80\x99s tennis also is growing. His second round-robin match, a 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5 victory over David Wagner, was broadcast live on national television. In his on-court interview, Alcott seemed more ecstatic about the viewership than the victory, hoping that disabled people around Australia had watched and drawn inspiration. (By contrast, he won the United States Open in September on an indoor practice facility rather than a main stadium because of rain.) '
b'Alcott, a hip-hop fan who has rapped on stage with Ghostface Killah, started his own music festival, Ability Fest, which catered to the needs of disabled people often left out of such events. The event featured interpreters for the deaf and elevated platforms for seated viewers.'
b'Alcott also founded Get Skilled Access, a consulting group that works to improve how governments and corporations interact with disabled people. His foundation finances opportunities for disabled people because, he noted, he needs $8,000 for a wheelchair while his brother needed only $100 pair of shoes to play Australian Rules Football.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt might not be Paralympics; it might be a cello, it might be a scholarship to go to university and become a lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d Alcott said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we see people with disabilities in boardroom, in the mainstream? It\xe2\x80\x99s because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been given the opportunities, and we want to provide that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Alcott had a 28-3 record last year on quad tennis circuit, which is for players with at least three extremities affected by a permanent physical disability. He hopes he, too, can grow into something bigger and more powerful than just a tennis player.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI could win 20 Grand Slams and I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d regret not doing what I love the most, which is changing perceptions of disability, which broadcasting helps.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Alcott said he would like to move to New York or London to reach a wider audience.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t a guy in a wheelchair be the next Jimmy Fallon, or whatever it is?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'As he started to expand on his vision for success in America, Alcott stopped and gestured to something much closer: a girl standing a few meters away, staring at him with a huge smile and tears in her eyes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHello! I\xe2\x80\x99m Dylan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Jessica, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on? Want to get a photo?\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 The first point of the Australian Open men\xe2\x80\x99s final on Sunday told the story of all that was to come.'
b'With his opening serve, Novak Djokovic stretched Rafael Nadal wide, sending the Spaniard sprawling. Djokovic quickly had his longtime rival exactly where he wanted: off balance and unglued.'
b'In a flash, as Nadal spun 360 degrees and scrambled to recover, Djokovic took a half-dozen confident steps forward. He lined up a backhand and then unleashed a buzzing winner that Nadal did not even try for.'
b'Point won. Point made. Rafael Nadal: toast.'
b'The match, held at Rod Laver Arena on a warm and slightly breezy evening, finished just 2 hours 4 minutes later, Djokovic winning in a full-blown knockout, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.'
b'This was a win that tightened the 31-year-old Serb\xe2\x80\x99s hold on the top spot in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. It also elevated his name once again in the annals of tennis history. He now has a record seven Australian Open titles and has moved to sole possession of third place for major titles, with 15, breaking a tie with Pete Sampras.'
b'The three powerhouse sets were as fine and dominating as Djokovic \xe2\x80\x94 or anyone \xe2\x80\x94 has ever played in a major tournament final.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt ranks right at the top,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said, assessing his performance at a news conference. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this level, under these circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He could not have seen this coming. Nobody could.'
b'Djokovic versus Nadal, No. 1 vs. No. 2, was arguably the most anticipated match of the tournament. It was the first occasion in which these two tense rivals \xe2\x80\x94 who have now played 53 times on tour, with Djokovic winning 28 \xe2\x80\x94 had met in the finals of a Grand Slam event since 2014, when Nadal slipped by Djokovic in four sets at Roland Garros in Paris.'
b'Given the scintillating way both had performed throughout the tournament, with Nadal winning every set he played in his first six matches and with Djokovic winning all but two, it seemed certain that they would duel once again deep into the Melbourne night.'
b'It was a match that was expected to dust off hallowed memories of what might have been their greatest combined moment of glory. In 2012, the two played one of the most epic finals in Grand Slam history, right on Laver\xe2\x80\x99s sea-blue center court: a 5-hour-53-minute marathon won by Djokovic, the longest major final ever.'
b'But a reprise was not to be. What unfolded was not even a reasonable facsimile.'
b'Still, the night had its own way of being unforgettable. The final failed to offer drama, but it did present beauty \xe2\x80\x94 that of a top-flight athlete, among tennis\xe2\x80\x99s greatest champions, operating at the very peak of his powers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThings started so quick,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said, snapping his fingers twice to emphasize the point. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was pushing me to every ball. He played so well. He hit so long. His return was fantastic. He was super quick.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nadal, 32, did not appear particularly downcast after the match. Instead, it seemed as if he had simply resigned himself to the result. He noted that he had been injured and had not been able to prepare for the tournament as he had wished. Indeed, after pulling out of his semifinal match at the United States Open last September and then having ankle surgery, he had not played a match on tour until this tournament began.'
b'But he also allowed that there had been nothing he could really do on Sunday against Djokovic, saying it \xe2\x80\x9cwas unbelievable, the way that he played, no doubt about that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic made only nine unforced errors. He lost just one point on his serve in the first set. He aggressively shortened every rally he could, keeping them to an average of five shots, a stunningly low number considering the long-distance finals he and Nadal have slugged out in the past. Riding pinpoint accuracy and depth, he so flummoxed Nadal that the Spaniard once swung and whiffed on a forehand.'
b'Nadal, whose tally for major titles remains at 17, three behind Roger Federer\xe2\x80\x99s record, threw all he could muster at the match, especially as it drained from his grip. He worked in as many drop shots as he could. He altered positioning on his returns. He moved early, trying to guess which way Djokovic was serving.'
b'Nothing worked.'
b'Djokovic led early in every stanza and never looked back. There was no tension. The match was shorter by 23 minutes than Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s stirring women\xe2\x80\x99s final between Naomi Osaka and Petra Kvitova, which also unfolded in three sets but was blessed by tension at every turn.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, one of the most important objectives for the match was to start off well and bring the intensity and make sure that he also feels my presence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Djokovic, who looked remarkably calm and centered, both during the match and afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always makes sure that the opponent across the net feels his presence. That is how he plays. That\xe2\x80\x99s how he behaves. He brings so much energy, jumping around, sprinting.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was crucial for me to start off with an early break. Having a set under my belt just made me relax a bit more, not really worry too much. After that, it was smooth.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Smooth. Perfect summary.'
b'It was a rare lopsided Grand Slam final between men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis greats, reminiscent of Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s wipeout of Federer at the 2008 French Open and John McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s rout of Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in 1984.'
b'But it should not be forgotten how far the two came to get to the finals, the hurdles overcome. There is Nadal with his injuries, which have piled up over the years, especially on hard courts. There is Djokovic with the way he struggled with his confidence and his health after winning the French Open in 2016. For two full tennis seasons, it felt as if he was lost in the wilderness, in matches including a fourth-round loss at Melbourne Park last year to the unseeded South Korean Hyeon Chung.'
b'Djokovic underwent elbow surgery not long after that match. At first, the operation did not help his on-court results. He appeared to be a doubting and unhappy shadow of his self. Improbably, he found his game on the Wimbledon grass, winning the title there and then following that up with another championship at the U.S. Open in September.'
b'According to the International Tennis Federation, Djokovic is the first man to record three streaks of three or more Grand Slam titles in a row. He won four straight from Wimbledon in 2015 to the 2016 French Open, and three in a row from Wimbledon in 2011 to the 2012 Australian Open.'
b'His chance to hold all four major titles at the same time will come in four months at the French Open, which he has won only once (Nadal has been the champion at Roland Garros 11 times).'
b'Sustain this level through the United States Open, and it is not impossible to imagine him winning a calendar-year Grand Slam. No man has done that since Rod Laver in 1969.'
b'And what about reaching Federer\xe2\x80\x99s record 20 Grand Slam titles?'
b'Asked about those milestones on Sunday, Djokovic was his typically reflective self.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware that making history of the sport that I truly love is something special,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'He then gave a nod to the kind of uncertainty that he knows very well, firsthand: the way injuries and loss of confidence can shake the very best of foundations. There are no sure bets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow many seasons are to come? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, noting that he was trying hard not to get too far ahead of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI do want to definitely focus myself on continuing to improve so I would be able to compete at such a high level for the years to come \xe2\x80\x94 and have a shot at eventually getting closer to Roger\xe2\x80\x99s record.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still far.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'True, but if he keeps playing in the fluid, focused way he did on this Sunday evening in Melbourne, 20 Grand Slams will come into focus soon enough.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Could the 2019 Australian Open be the Grand Slam tournament in which a budding cast of young American men breaks through?'
b'The odds remain against that happening \xe2\x80\x94 thanks in part to a guy named Roger Federer \xe2\x80\x94 and there remains much tennis to be played. But after a pair of second-round upsets by Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, the stage just might be set.'
b'The first surprise came when Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, finished off fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson behind powerful forehands and serves. It was the biggest win of Tiafoe\xe2\x80\x99s young career and the biggest shock of the tournament so far.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99mon!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, rolling up his right shirt sleeve, then thumping his right biceps repeatedly with his left hand, a move that seemed freighted with both bravado and relief. Tiafoe, the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone who learned the game at the Maryland tennis club where his father was a custodian, has long been touted as a prodigious talent. But he has also seemed burdened by the weight of expectations.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means the world to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe told a crowd he had clearly won over during the tense three-hour match.'
b'The arena scoreboard flashed with the final score, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5, telling a story of its own. Early on, Anderson had pushed ahead, leading by 3-0 in the second set after winning the first. Then Tiafoe turned the tide.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI lost to Kevin three times last year,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe, ranked No. 39, explained in an on-court interview. \xe2\x80\x9cI was down a set and break today. I went to a different place. I dug deep. It\xe2\x80\x99s just how bad you want it, and I wanted it bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Indeed, in the beginning, it looked as if Tiafoe might soon be flying home for more practice at the United States Tennis Association\xe2\x80\x99s campus in Orlando, Fla., where many young American hopefuls train. But then he altered his approach \xe2\x80\x94 and flashed the kind of game that he will have to employ if he is to get past Andreas Seppi of Italy, a tour veteran ranked No. 35, in the third round.'
b'He had decided to \xe2\x80\x9ckind of just mix it up,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay smarter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to go for cannons. Be unpredictable.\xe2\x80\x9d Once he settled on a game plan, Tiafoe was particularly effective mixing a slew of low-bouncing slices into his powerful repertoire, forcing Anderson out of his comfort zone, making Anderson bend and contort his 6-foot-8 frame.'
b'How far can Tiafoe go at this tournament? When I posed that question to him, he was succinct. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the third round, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before laughing slyly.'
b'Should Tiafoe beat Seppi on Friday, he would find himself deeper in a Grand Slam tournament than he has ever been. Maybe because he\xe2\x80\x99s keenly aware of that fact, he leaned on a tried-and-true sports clich\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x94 but one that might show he has enough locked-in maturity to do real damage right now. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to consider anything more than the next match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook at today, I mean, he is five in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said, referring to Anderson, who is actually ranked No. 6. \xe2\x80\x9cI was able to beat him. It\xe2\x80\x99s so tight now. Anybody plays a good match, you can beat anybody on a given day.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fritz, 21, a Californian ranked 50th, can only hope those last words ring true. Shortly after Tiafoe\xe2\x80\x99s win, Fritz upset 30th-seeded Ga\xc3\xabl Monfils of France, 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). The match featured some of the most exquisite shotmaking of the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s opening days.'
b'Like Tiafoe, Fritz has never advanced past the third round of a major. But Fritz\xe2\x80\x99s next opponent is Federer, the two-time defending champion and No. 3 seed. The two have played only once: Federer won a tight three-setter on grass in 2016, as Fritz was just starting out on the tour.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI learned my lesson last time we played,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI won the second set, and it was one of the most amazing feelings I have ever had playing tennis, winning a set off Roger Federer! And then we were deep in the third and I had a chance to break his serve, and I started thinking: Oh my God, I am about to beat Federer. I might beat Federer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that thinking definitely lost me the match pretty quick. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t win another game after that. I have definitely learned I just have to treat it like any other match.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Playing Federer in Melbourne will not be any other match, of course. Same for Tiafoe, when he battles Seppi. But both matches present a real opportunity.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBetween Frances and Taylor today, we saw something different, something better, an intensity and composure I have never seen before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Blackman, the U.S.T.A.\xe2\x80\x99s general manager for player development. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of our players can learn from this.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Blackman oversees a group that includes the 7-footer Reilly Opelka, 21, who upset ninth-seeded John Isner on Monday before losing a five-setter on Wednesday, and Mackenzie McDonald, 23, the former N.C.A.A. champion who fell in four tight sets to sixth-seeded Marin Cilic.'
b'If any of the young American men are to begin making a bona fide dent in pro tennis, there is no better time to start than now.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Simona Halep of Romania is ranked No. 1 in the world in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. Last season, she won her first Grand Slam title, on the red clay of Roland Garros.'
b'On Monday night at Melbourne Park, she faced an opponent who, if judged by the numerical listing spit out by the pro tour\xe2\x80\x99s computer, should have been handled by Halep with relative ease. Except that player, currently ranked 16th in the world, is no slouch. That player, in fact, is Serena Williams, pure greatness in fishnet tights.'
b'Halep versus Williams in the round of 16 was a rare moment in tennis. It was a match in which the top-ranked player was also the decided underdog. Not only was Halep facing a formidable opponent with 23 major titles, seven of them in Melbourne alone, but she was also confronting someone who had dominated their career head-to-head matchups, winning eight times and losing just once.'
b'So it was hardly a shock that Williams ended up improving that record on Monday, rolling past the 27-year-old Halep by a 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 score.'
b'In the quarterfinals, Williams will now face seventh-seeded Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, who easily defeated Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza of Spain, 6-3, 6-1, to advance. Williams has beaten Pliskova twice in three matches, but the one loss came in the United States Open semifinals in 2016. Pliskova, meanwhile, has won all nine matches she has played this season. Williams will be the lower-ranked player when they meet but is again the actual favorite.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have to return better, but I will be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams vowed as she looked ahead to Pliskova. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s ready, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was vintage Serena confidence. And it also stood in contrast to her demeanor at the very beginning of her match against Halep. In those opening moments, Williams actually seemed shaky. She lost her first service game, the product of uncharacteristically poor shot-making and a clunky double fault.'
b'But in a flash, Williams got going. Playing with great precision, she continuously sent balls deep and into corners, often for winners.'
b'Game after game flew by, six straight in all decided in Williams\xe2\x80\x99s favor. At the age of 37, she simply did not allow her younger opponent to find her rhythm. Total time for the opening set: 20 minutes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I\xe2\x80\x99d been hit by a train,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep would say later.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI played really good,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said when asked about that first set. She spoke in a plain, matter-of-fact tone.'
b'A question came: \xe2\x80\x9cWere those six straight games the best you had played since coming back last year after the baby was born?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut probably.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Still, Halep is among the most tenacious fighters in tennis, and as the match progressed, she began extending the rallies, which is more to her liking and style. She began serving better, fending off Williams\xe2\x80\x99s attacks.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt that my level is growing,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep said afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had more confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And after capturing the second set, there was a brief period in the third when Halep appeared to have Williams on the ropes. Williams looked fatigued, her movements slower and less sure. But midway through that final set, Williams fended off three crucial break points. In the last, she pinned Halep into a corner and blasted a backhand winner down the line.'
b'As happens so often in tennis, Halep had trouble bouncing back from missing such an important opening. And as happens so often when Williams seems to be in trouble, she broke serve in the next game, seizing control with a string of strong baseline replies.'
b'When the last game of the match arrived, Halep offered meager resistance. Williams had prevailed again. Total time: 1 hour 47 minutes.'
b'Afterward, Halep was asked about the dynamics of taking on Williams, and whose confidence should have been higher when the match began.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ranked No. 1, and she is Serena Williams,\xe2\x80\x9d the questioner began before Halep politely cut him off.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'That one word response said it all, for Halep and for all of the women not named Serena who end up at the top of the computer rankings so long as she is playing.'
b'Williams now seems to be closing in on her old form after taking time off following the 2017 birth of her daughter. Even with that layoff, Williams still made the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year. At the U.S. Open, she lost the final to Naomi Osaka in a swirl of controversy and accusations of sexism.'
b'Williams is on a collision course with Osaka again. Seeded fourth in Melbourne, Osaka advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Anastasija Sevastova on Monday. Osaka next plays sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina and could face Williams in the semifinals.'
b'Williams\xe2\x80\x99s goal is clear and right there for the taking. If she wins her next three matches, she wins her 24th Grand Slam title, at last equaling the Australian great Margaret Court\xe2\x80\x99s total of major singles championships.'
b'Will she?'
b'Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, offered the strongest assessment.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is ready physically, I think emotionally, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is back,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cto being Serena.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 For Simona Halep, it was better to think that the United States Open wasn\xe2\x80\x99t held last year.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever happened,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep said, grinning. \xe2\x80\x9cThat tournament didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Top-seeded Halep was ousted from that tournament within its opening hours, blasted off the court by Kaia Kanepi in a 6-2, 6-4 demolition that sent shock waves through the newly built Louis Armstrong Stadium.'
b'Five months and 10,000 miles removed from that scene on Tuesday evening at the Australian Open, Halep was able to build back her sturdy defenses, digging into a gritty first-round rematch and defeating Kanepi, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 6-4, in 2 hours 11 minutes.'
b'Halep, who has had a tendency to give into negativity when being outplayed, did not relent this time. She expressed frustration, exasperation and disbelief after Kanepi struck many of her 40 winners, but remained dialed in throughout.'
b'Halep said all she could control was her effort.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s the best match I played in the last period, not giving up for one ball,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I improved in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Halep\xe2\x80\x99s consistent, rugged defense eventually outlasted Kanepi\xe2\x80\x99s attacking; Halep hit only eight unforced errors in the final two sets, compared with 36 by Kanepi.'
b'Though a first-round win against a player ranked 71st would not normally be a milestone for a top seed, it was a steep test for Halep. Not only had she been clobbered by Kanepi in their previous meeting, Halep had not won a match since, losing three times and pulling out of the year-end championships with a back injury.'
b'Halep, who has maintained her No. 1 ranking despite not winning a match since August in Cincinnati, projected no precariousness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of all these things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot play tennis anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A No. 1 ranked player whose ranking merits a Wheaties box but whose dominance belongs on the side of a milk carton is hardly a rare phenomenon in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis. Dinara Safina, Ana Ivanovic and Angelique Kerber are among those went through crises of confidence when they reached the top of the ladder. Halep preached contentment, particularly after winning a long-awaited first Grand Slam title at last year\xe2\x80\x99s French Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not putting pressure on myself anymore with the results, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still motivated,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat comes now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bonus.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Halep split with her longtime coach Darren Cahill at the end of last season, but she projected much of the clarity he instilled in her game \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps because the two are still in close contact. Cahill, also an analyst for ESPN, the American rights holder for the tournament, was on her court during pretournament practices.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to have him around,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso it\xe2\x80\x99s tough that he\xe2\x80\x99s not in my team anymore. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do. For sure, I need a coach, because at this level you cannot do it alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m just chilling for the moment, and we will see after this tournament.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Because of Halep\xe2\x80\x99s slide, and the even distribution of titles around the top tier of the tour, nine women can leave Melbourne with the No. 1 ranking at the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s end. Halep, who finished the last two seasons at the top, said retaining the spot was not in the front of her mind.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe ranking doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI play tennis because I like it. Now my challenge is to win every match I play. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s probably impossible, but I\xe2\x80\x99m trying just to stay with this thought, and give it my best.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Several current and former coaches, some with national titles and many with ties to U.S.C., were named in a federal indictment Tuesday.'
b'By Andrew Das, Marc Tracy and Naila-Jean Meyers'
b'The coaches led soccer teams and sailing teams, guided water polo champions and budding volleyball stars. At least two had won N.C.A.A. championships. A third gave Michelle Obama and her daughters tennis lessons from his post at Georgetown. '
b'The coaches charged Tuesday in a massive federal college admissions fraud scandal were some of the most prominent in their fields. But it was their apparent willingness to exploit their access to the admissions process at several exclusive universities that has them facing federal charges. '
b'Who are they? Several had deep associations with the University of Southern California, where Donna Heinel, a senior athletic department administrator, is accused of playing a central role in the scandal. For nearly a decade, Heinel had overseen the admissions of athletes into U.S.C., working closely with several of the current and former Trojans coaches who have been indicted. She was fired Tuesday.'
b'Here is a brief look at the current and former coaches identified by a federal complaint.'
b'U.S.C. water polo coach'
b'Vavic won 16 national titles at U.S.C., more than any coach in university history (10 in men\xe2\x80\x99s water polo, the most recent coming in December, and six in women\xe2\x80\x99s water polo). He was fired Tuesday after he was arrested in connection with the admissions scheme. He had coached the women\xe2\x80\x99s team, currently ranked No. 1 and the defending national champion, since 1995 and had been the sole head coach of the men\xe2\x80\x99s team since 1999. A 15-time national coach of the year, Vavic was named the Pac-12 Conference\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccoach of the century\xe2\x80\x9d for water polo in 2015. '
b'According to the indictment, the co-conspirators in the admissions fraud paid $250,000 to an account that financed the U.S.C. water polo program, and in return Vavic recommended two students as recruits to the water polo team. The ringleader of the scheme, William Singer, known as Rick, is said to have paid the private school tuition for Vavic\xe2\x80\x99s children through one of his company\xe2\x80\x99s charitable accounts \xe2\x80\x9cunder the guise of a fabricated scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Former Georgetown tennis coach'
b'According to the indictment, Ernst, known as Gordie, earned more than $2.7 million between 2012 and 2018 in payments that were falsely labeled \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting\xe2\x80\x9d fees. He \xe2\x80\x9cdesignated at least 12 applicants as recruits\xe2\x80\x9d for Georgetown\xe2\x80\x99s tennis teams, court papers said, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding some who did not play competitively.\xe2\x80\x9d One such player, listed in the complaint, was encouraged to make playing tennis part of her application essay and claimed to be a top-50-ranking player in the U.S.T.A. for junior girls, which was not true. She was accepted at Georgetown in 2016. '
b'A spokeswoman for Georgetown said Tuesday that the university had fired Ernst in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. Ernst, a native of Rhode Island who is in the New England Sports Hall of Fame, was named the women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last August. The university placed him on administrative leave on Tuesday. '
b'Wake Forest volleyball coach'
b'Ferguson has been the women\xe2\x80\x99s volleyball coach at Wake Forest since 2016. Before that, he coached the men\xe2\x80\x99s team at U.S.C., winning 150 matches and leading the Trojans to three N.C.A.A. Final Fours. He was the American Volleyball Coaches Association coach of the year in 2009 and 2012. His success has not continued at Wake Forest, where he was 22-41 in his first two seasons. After Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s charges were unsealed, Wake Forest announced that he has been placed on administrative leave. Ferguson is accused of accepting $100,000 from Singer in 2017 to help Singer\xe2\x80\x99s client\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance to Wake Forest as a volleyball recruit.'
b' U.C.L.A. men\xe2\x80\x99s soccer coach'
b'Salcedo has been U.C.L.A.\xe2\x80\x99s men\xe2\x80\x99s soccer coach since 2004. The Bruins are one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top programs annually, and Salcedo has produced dozens of players who have gone on to play professional soccer. A former All-American at U.C.L.A. who had a brief career in Major League Soccer and other leagues, he has been a member of the Bruins\xe2\x80\x99 soccer program as either a player, assistant coach or head coach for two decades. He is accused of helping two students gain admission to U.C.L.A. as student-athletes in exchange for $200,000. The Los Angeles Times and others reported that he had been placed on leave Tuesday.'
b'Former U.S.C. women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer coaches'
b'Khosroshahin won a national championship in his first season with the Trojans in 2007, when he was named national coach of the year, but he was fired in 2013 after missing the N.C.A.A. tournament three years in a row. U.S.C. went 8-10-2 in his final season; he was 82-53-15 over all. '
b'Janke joined Khosroshahin\xe2\x80\x99s U.S.C. coaching staff as an assistant after playing for him in his previous job at Cal State-Fullerton. A biography of her at the Geffen Academy, a private school in Los Angeles for students in grades 6 through 12, lists her as the physical education department chair. A previous announcement hailed her hiring as the head of the school\xe2\x80\x99s girls soccer program. '
b'In the indictment, Singer is said to have contributed $350,000 a private soccer club run by Khosroshahin and Janke in exchange for their suggesting four children of Singer\xe2\x80\x99s clients as recruits. '
b'Khosroshahin and Janke were also asked to create misleading recruiting profiles and to serve as references for students who were not competitive soccer players in order to help them gain admission to other colleges. '
b'Former Yale women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer coach'
b'A third cooperating witness in court papers was an unnamed person whose description closely matches Meredith, who served as Yale\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer coach from 1995 through late last year. Meredith was also a participant in the scheme, according to court filings. Meredith resigned as Yale\xe2\x80\x99s coach in November after a disappointing season, but also after, the authorities said Tuesday, he had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of payments to facilitate the admission of a non-soccer-playing soccer recruit to Yale. When he stepped down after last season, Meredith told the university that \xe2\x80\x9cit is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d A month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. '
b'Stanford sailing coach'
b'Vandemoer is accused of taking financial contributions to his championship-winning sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither student came to Stanford,\xe2\x80\x9d Stanford said in a statement Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s values.\xe2\x80\x9d Stanford said Vandemoer had been fired.'
b'Texas men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis coach'
b'The Longhorns have one of the top programs in the country, having reached the N.C.A.A. tournament every season since Center took over in 2000. He was placed on administrative leave Tuesday after being accused of accepting $100,000 from Singer in 2015 in exchange for recruiting a student who was not a competitive tennis player. According to court papers, the student\xe2\x80\x99s application to Texas said he played one year of tennis as a freshman, but his other activities included being manager of his high school basketball and football teams. The student withdrew from the tennis team shortly after beginning classes at Texas. '

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 No matter how smooth and imperious Roger Federer looked in the Miami Open final, whipping winners seemingly on demand and breaking big John Isner\xe2\x80\x99s serve on four occasions, Federer knows all too well how fragile this all is as the shadows lengthen.'
b'There can be no doubt that Federer is back near top gear at 37. He is moving like a man 10 years younger and has a sparkling 18-2 record this season. After his 6-1, 6-4 victory on Sunday, he is the first man or woman to win more than one singles title in 2019.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKind of fitting,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said of Federer ending that unprecedented streak of 33 different singles champions. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of our game\xe2\x80\x99s greats.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Perhaps the greatest, though it remains so tough to compare apples to apples and Federers to Lavers. Comparing eras is seemingly as foolish an errand as writing definitive lists until Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are all done winning, too.'
b'But Federer\xe2\x80\x99s enduring excellence is an evermore elegant and persuasive argument, even if the reminders of how challenging it is for tennis champions to endure and prosper were right there in front of him again on Sunday.'
b'There was his opponent, the defending champion Isner, 33, suddenly hobbling between points in the second set with a left foot injury that Isner fears could be a stress fracture.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have never had anything like this before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isner, who began feeling the pain late in the first set.'
b'And when it very soon came time for Federer to accept his fourth Miami Open singles trophy, one of the officials whose hands he shook was the tournament director James Blake, one of his former tour rivals who is now 39 and long retired.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cRoger, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to say,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake said after Federer\xe2\x80\x99s 101st tour singles title. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just makes me feel like such an underachiever.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nearly all the stars of Federer\xe2\x80\x99s tennis generation have moved on to other roles: Tommy Haas, one of Federer\xe2\x80\x99s closer friends, is now the tournament director at Indian Wells.'
b'Federer made his debut in Miami in 1999 and is the only man who participated that year who is still playing singles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a superlong journey for me here,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a wild card here in \xe2\x80\x9999 and made my first final here in 2002 against Andre Agassi.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He went on to win the title in 2005, 2006 and again in 2017, the year when he roared back to the top after recovering from knee surgery.'
b'That could have been his last hurrah, but the hurrahs keep coming with titles at Dubai and Miami in 2019 and a very close call at Indian Wells, where he was beaten in three tight sets by Dominic Thiem in the final.'
b'But Federer bounced back convincingly in a familiar tournament in an unfamiliar place: Hard Rock Stadium, the Open\xe2\x80\x99s new, much more capacious home after 31 years in the more intimate, boutique setting of Key Biscayne.'
b'In 2018, when the event was still on an island instead of in an N.F.L. stadium, Federer lost in his opening round to Thanasi Kokkinakis. Though Federer had another scare in the same round this year against the qualifier Radu Albot, he rallied to win in three sets and then gathered nothing but momentum, winning five straight matches in straight sets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy just to say, \xe2\x80\x98Well last year didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t come back this year, and as I\xe2\x80\x99m playing the clay, maybe add rather another clay-court event,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I felt like let\xe2\x80\x99s extend the hardcourt season. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see the new venue. To be honest, I think that was something also I was excited to see. I did feel like the game was there last year, and I thought also the game was definitely here this year even after the Australian Open. So I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with the team, we took the right decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The team has also agreed that Federer will play on clay for the first time since brief, unfulfilling visits to Monte Carlo and Rome in 2016. His next tournament: Madrid in early May, which will give him time to reboot and reacquaint himself with the game\xe2\x80\x99s grittiest surface.'
b'How confident is he?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot very confident,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember how to slide anymore. You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking baby steps at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is smart, as ever, to try to underpromise and overdeliver, particularly when you are entering the kingdom of Nadal, the 11-time French Open champion and most successful men\xe2\x80\x99s clay-court player in history.'
b'But Federer, despite his fourth-round loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Australian Open, has certainly had another hardcourt run to savor in 2019.'
b'He looked thoroughly in his element on Sunday, just as Isner feared and expected he would.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was going to play well today; I knew he was seeing the ball very big,\xe2\x80\x9d Isner said. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that was the case. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to the task in the first set, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Before the final, Federer compared the experience of facing Isner\xe2\x80\x99s serve to that of a soccer goalkeeper facing a penalty kick.'
b'If you embrace that metaphor, he made a very quick save, breaking Isner in the opening game, blunting the power with sliced returns on the stretch and then hooking passing shots that even the 6-foot-10 Isner struggled to reach.'
b'Federer rolled through his own service games in a hurry. He won all 20 of his first-serve points in the match and dropped only three points on his second serve.'
b'Isner, who had not faced Federer in an official match since 2015, would have needed to be very near the top of his game to stop this train or even get into one of his beloved tiebreakers.'
b'But he was far from his peak and eventually in great discomfort, limping down the stretch after an injury timeout late in the second set and later wincing and limping off the dais in the interview room.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou hope it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing serious, and I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Federer, who said experience helped him remain focused as Isner struggled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s tricky, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tricky indeed to remain hale and hearty year after year in a Darwinian individual sport; even trickier to keep holding up trophies year after year with younger men swinging full force across the net.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Still struggling with a hip injury that has limited him since June 2016, Andy Murray announced Friday that he would retire after this year\xe2\x80\x99s Wimbledon \xe2\x80\x94 if not sooner.'
b'Murray said that his decision to end his playing career this year had come during his off-season training in December.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to my team, and I told them, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot keep doing this,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said in an emotional news conference in Melbourne. \xe2\x80\x9cI needed to have an end point because I was sort of playing with no idea when the pain was going to stop. I felt like making that decision.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI said to my team, \xe2\x80\x98Look, I think I can get through this until Wimbledon.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s where I would like to stop playing. But I am also not certain I am able to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray, 31, became the first British male singles champion at a Grand Slam tournament in 76 years when he won the United States Open in 2012. He won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016 and won Olympic gold medals in singles in 2012 and 2016. Murray reached the ATP\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 ranking for the first time at the end of the 2016 season, holding on to it through Wimbledon the next year.'
b'A counterpuncher who wears down opponents through his elite physicality and guile, Murray earned a reputation as one of the hardest-working players of his generation. He is popular among his peers for an off-court affability that provided a striking contrast from his often ornery on-court demeanor. Murray was particularly admired by many in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis for his vocal support of their tour and his decision to hire Am\xc3\xa9lie Mauresmo as his coach in 2014.'
b'Andrea Petkovic said that she had been an admirer of Murray \xe2\x80\x9ceven before he kind of became WTA\xe2\x80\x99s darling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always my favorite, and I think it will be a huge loss for tennis in general, but also for the WTA,\xe2\x80\x9d Petkovic added. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause even nowadays, when you think everything is equal, you still need men, especially successful men, to speak up for women.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Though often in the shadow of the others in the Big Four of men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis \xe2\x80\x94 Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal \xe2\x80\x94 Murray is considered by many the greatest sportsman in Scottish history. He was knighted at 29.'
b'Just two years later, with a ranking of 230 after the injury layoff, Murray accepted his mortality in the sport. The weight of the decision was obvious in his news conference on Friday, when he broke down after the opening question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you feeling, and how is the hip injury?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, not great,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said, his voice quavering. He then sighed and let his emotions flood in, and left the interview room for about three minutes to compose himself.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, not feeling good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said when he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been struggling for a long time. I have been in a lot of pain. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been probably about 20 months now.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have pretty much done everything that I could to try and get my hip feeling better, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t helped loads. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a better place than I was six months ago but still in a lot of pain. Yeah, it has been tough.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray said he still planned to play at the Australian Open, where he is a five-time runner-up. His first match will be Monday against 22nd-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut.'
b'Murray\xe2\x80\x99s outlook in Melbourne looked bleak even before his announcement. In a practice match Thursday, Murray was thrashed by his longtime rival Djokovic, who led 6-1, 4-1, before their time slot on the court ended.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can still play to a level \xe2\x80\x94 not a level that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy playing at,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just that: The pain is too much, really. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to continue playing that way. I think I have tried pretty much everything I could to get it right, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray had hip surgery last January, and he said he had seen his Melbourne-based surgeon on Thursday. He said that although the operation had helped, it had not alleviated his pain, which he said had been the \xe2\x80\x9cdriving factor\xe2\x80\x9d in his decision.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can play with limitations, that\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s having the limitations, and also the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing, training or any of the stuff I love about tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Asked if the Australian Open could be his last tournament, Murray paused and wiped away tears again.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a chance of that, for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, like I said, I am not sure I am able to play through the pain for another four or five months.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray said that his injury had also taken an emotional toll.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have talked a lot, way too much, about my hip for 18 months,\xe2\x80\x9d Murray said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a daily thing. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just people I work with that ask me; it\xe2\x80\x99s everyone. So everyone I bump into, that is all I talk about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty draining.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Murray said that he had spoken \xe2\x80\x9cnot loads, but a number of times\xe2\x80\x9d with psychologists about his injury.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing helps because you are in lots, lots and lots of pain,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot do what it is that you want to do, and you love doing. Or I can do it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not fun or enjoyable doing it anymore.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I have done. I have tried to deal with it, talked about it, but none of that makes my hip feel better, unfortunately. I wish it did, because if it did, it would be feeling brilliant right now. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 It started as a curiosity, believed to be the tallest match in tennis\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Slam history.'
b'And yet by the end of a nearly three-hour slugfest on the Australian Open\xe2\x80\x99s opening day on Monday, fans left less impressed by all of the long-limbed height than by the guts of the surprising victor: the virtually unknown Reilly Opelka \xe2\x80\x94 21, American, 7 feet tall in socks \xe2\x80\x94 who doled out an eye-popping upset by defeating his ninth-seeded compatriot John Isner, 33, who stands a looming 6 feet 10 inches.'
b'Tennis players in the modern era trend taller than the players of yesteryear, even compared to those of 15 and 20 years ago. But not this much taller. In a sport where the best male players still typically hover around 6 feet (top-ranked Novak Djokovic is listed at 6-2), not only do Isner and Opelka seem like human skyscrapers, they come to the court for each match with the simplest game plan possible: Crush serves, slam forehands and hide their considerable deficiencies in movement by keeping every point whiplash short.'
b'Staring across the net at Isner, Opelka said after the match, was like looking in the mirror, and not just because of his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s height.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot of things that are out of your control,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking of the distress that comes from playing one of the few who can hit just as hard as he can, and from such high, imposing angles. \xe2\x80\x9cI was expecting that today I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch too many balls. I was hoping the same for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Official match statistics back Opelka up. He did not touch many balls. The average rally lasted two shots. On only four points were at least nine balls struck. Isner slammed 47 aces. Opelka slammed 40, the last a 141-mile-per-hour fastball that Isner barely moved for.'
b'The final score underscored how little separated the pair. Opelka, ranked No. 97, won, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5).'
b'When it was over, Isner could barely hide the disappointment. He rarely made eye contact during the postmatch news conference. At times, his hands shook with tension.'
b'He has long been ranked in the top 20 on the ATP Tour. Last season was his best. He won his first World Tour Masters 1000 at the Miami Open, made the semifinals at Wimbledon and, as one of the top players of the year, appeared in the elite tour finals in London.'
b'But last season also started poorly, punctuated with a loss that was in some ways similar to the one against Opelka: a first-round defeat at the Australian Open at the hands of a little known, albeit much smaller opponent, Matthew Ebden, an Australian who stands a tour-typical 6-2.'
b'Isner vowed to lean on the fact that he had begun last season in such bad shape \xe2\x80\x94 not only being upset in Melbourne but posting an early record of two wins and six losses \xe2\x80\x94 before breaking through and winning Miami.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was off and running from there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust got to get one under my belt and see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Though hardly one for long answers, Opelka appeared relaxed and casual as he spoke in the wake of the most significant victory of his young career. He spoke of the main difference between him and Isner. In the early stages of his career, Opelka, who is listed as 6-11 but has acknowledged that he is even taller, does not have a deeply successful professional past to hark back to.'
b'Hence, even after Monday, his primary motive remains clear: Keep playing well enough that he never again has to compete in tennis\xe2\x80\x99s often brutal minor leagues, where he won two titles at the end of last season to break into the top 100.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the immediate goal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'More than making a long run in Melbourne?'
b'Yes, he replied, saying he could only allow himself to think of his next match, against Thomas Fabbiano, an Italian who is ranked No. 102 and, compared to Isner, is a relative munchkin.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne guy is 5-10,\xe2\x80\x9d Opelka said, referring to Fabbiano. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other guy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, referring to Isner not by name but with a pregnant pause, \xe2\x80\x9cis not.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Time did not freeze, like a televised sporting event placed on pause, during the 13 months Serena Williams spent away from tennis. The absence of Williams, who has averaged one title in every three majors played, allowed younger players to wade deeper into the draws and grow their games and their confidence.'
b'Karolina Pliskova, 26, was already on the rise when a pregnant Williams took her leave from tennis after winning the 2017 Australian Open. The previous year, Pliskova had graced the final of the United States Open, beating Williams on the way. But it was the only Grand Slam event where she advanced past the third round in 2016.'
b'With Williams out of the picture from February 2017 to March 2018, the ascent of Pliskova continued apace. Advancing to the quarterfinals or better in 15 of 20 tournaments in 2017, Pliskova assumed the women\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 1 ranking that July, two months after Williams\xe2\x80\x99s last stay there.'
b'In the eight majors contested since Williams\xe2\x80\x99s last Grand Slam title, at the 2017 Australian Open, Pliskova has made it to the quarterfinals or better in five. With her 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 defeat of Williams on Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open on Wednesday, Pliskova avenged a two-set quarterfinal loss to Williams at last year\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Open.'
b'The way Pliskova pulled out the victory was telling; she played the big points as fearlessly as Williams, 37, once did. Down by 1-5 in the third set, Pliskova won six consecutive games and staved off four match points by swinging for the lines and serving to dime-sized spots. She did to Williams what Williams did to Kim Clijsters in the 2003 semifinals here. In that match, Williams staved off two match points while climbing back from a 1-5 deficit, then beat her sister, Venus, in the final to hold all four major titles concurrently.'
b'That Williams had an aura that sometimes all but overshadowed her. The Williams standing across the net from Pliskova hasn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciably changed. In spotting the rest of the women\xe2\x80\x99s game a full year, she simply gave everybody else a chance to catch up to her level of intensity and fight.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis time I just feel somehow different and more confident,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not doubting myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams held her first match point while serving at 5-1 in the third. She was called a foot fault on her first serve. Then at the end of the point she turned her left ankle after Pliskova wrong-footed her. Williams never called for a trainer to treat her ankle.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt that point I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I needed it or I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it would be a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams explained.'
b'There was a good reason she felt that way. Many times over the years, less than Williams\xe2\x80\x99s best was good enough.'
b'But that no longer is the case.'
b'Williams\xe2\x80\x99s serve has always been the weapon she can lean on when all else fails. On Wednesday, Williams didn\xe2\x80\x99t win another point on her serve after turning her ankle.'
b'Williams said of Pliskova: \xe2\x80\x9cI think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it had anything to do with my ankle per se.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams was right. Did her level of play drop in the last six games? Yes. But to focus on that is to miss the bigger picture. Williams lost because during the year that she spent growing a child instead of a game, Pliskova and the other top players got better.'
b'If Williams is to resume her winning ways, she will have to play better than she did in 2017, when she vanquished Venus here for her 23rd major title.'
b'It is not impossible. Williams\xe2\x80\x99s mission, if she chooses to accept it, is to forget the past and resolutely move forward, one honest day\xe2\x80\x99s work at a time. The good news for tennis is that she seems committed to the chase of Margaret Court and her record 24 major singles titles.'
b'This was Williams\xe2\x80\x99s eighth official tournament since her return from a difficult pregnancy. The golfer Tiger Woods, with whom Williams is friendly, won the Tour Championship in his 18th official start after his return from back surgery. As long as Williams is patient, she can once again prosper.'
b'Speaking earlier in the week, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said it was unrealistic to expect Williams to hit the tour winning after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. She won no titles last year, but reached the final at Wimbledon and the United States Open, losing to opponents whose masterly performances kept her off balance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot buy time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThings take time. To get back to shape, back in shape after a baby, a few months are not enough. I mean, still she could have won because she\xe2\x80\x99s doing things other people don\xe2\x80\x99t, but it was \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, the story said it was too early. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams didn\xe2\x80\x99t win six majors before her 22nd birthday because she was a patient person. But motherhood is a daily practice in living in the moment, and Williams is nothing if not a diligent student. Earlier in the tournament, she said her year off \xe2\x80\x9cgave me a new fire, a new purpose, a new meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It did the same for her opponents, which is why the women\xe2\x80\x99s game is infinitely more interesting now that Williams is back.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 The first tennis player to capture Novak Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s imagination was a big-serving American with a beautiful one-handed backhand. A grade-school-aged Djokovic, living in the Serbian mountain resort town of Kopaonik, watched on television as Pete Sampras won one of his seven Wimbledon titles, and he fell madly in love with tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI did not have a tennis tradition in my family,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it was definitely a sign of destiny to start playing tennis, to aspire to be as good as Pete.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic tried to emulate Sampras\xe2\x80\x99s game, right down to the one-handed backhand, before his first coach, Jelena Gencic, encouraged him to switch to both hands because that was his natural stroke. But on other things, Djokovic refused to budge.'
b'Most significantly, Djokovic never abandoned the belief that he would grow up to be the best men\xe2\x80\x99s player in the world, like Sampras, who held the year-end No. 1 ranking for a men\xe2\x80\x99s record six years beginning in 1993, when a 6-year-old Djokovic began playing tennis in earnest.'
b'On Sunday at the Australian Open, Djokovic finally and decisively slipped the surly bonds of Sampras. With his 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Rafael Nadal, Djokovic secured his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking his tie with Sampras. Djokovic took sole possession of third on the list, behind his contemporaries Roger Federer (20) and Nadal (17).'
b'When Sampras retired in 2002, he held the record for men\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Slam titles. Unlike Djokovic, who has peers to push him, Sampras spent his career in a mostly lonely pursuit of a long-retired player, Roy Emerson, who collected 12 major championships, including a men\xe2\x80\x99s record six Australian Open titles.'
b'Emerson, 82, attended Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final at Rod Laver Arena, and, like the 47-year-old Sampras, he had a target on his back. Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s title was his seventh at Melbourne Park. When he met up with Emerson after the trophy presentation, Djokovic said, smiling, that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Emerson\xe2\x80\x9d was mad at him for breaking his record.'
b'The careers of Djokovic and Sampras never intersected \xe2\x80\x94 Djokovic turned pro the year after Sampras retired \xe2\x80\x94 but their paths crossed in Los Angeles in 2013 when they played together (and lost) in an exhibition doubles match at U.C.L.A. against Bob and Mike Bryan.'
b'At the time, Djokovic described it as \xe2\x80\x9ca blast\xe2\x80\x9d to share the court with Sampras and said he had always hoped to play a match with or against him. Two months before the exhibition, Djokovic had collected his sixth Grand Slam title with his fourth Australian Open crown. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t considered a given that he would one day share a piece of Grand Slam history with Sampras, much less move past him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo surpass him with Grand Slam titles, I\xe2\x80\x99m speechless,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t had too much time to contemplate on everything that has happened, but I\xe2\x80\x99m planning to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In 2014, Sampras returned to the Australian Open as a spectator, and while there, he sat for a news conference in which he fielded a question about the aging process for champion athletes.'
b'Sampras was 31, the same age that Djokovic is now, when he retired. The grind of the tour, especially the extensive travel, eroded his motivation, Sampras said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you get older, it just gets tougher,\xe2\x80\x9d Sampras said then. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gets tougher to play. It gets tougher to travel. Sometimes it gets a little stale.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI just know from my perspective, I was fatigued the last couple years. I was enjoying my tennis, but it was a tough job.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic understands what Sampras meant. He traveled here without his wife and two small children. During the trophy presentation, Djokovic thanked his loved ones in absentia for their forbearance. He expressed gratitude for all the sacrifices they made so that he could maintain what he described as a selfish existence. He said that it was hard to be apart from his family for weeks on end.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHunger is always there,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut nowadays it\xe2\x80\x99s just more relevant for me to organize myself in life better, to manage to be very concise and concrete with what I do and what I plan to do, because I am a father and a husband. Right now it\xe2\x80\x99s not only about tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After his fourth-round exit here last year, Djokovic had surgery on his elbow, and that was tough, too, he said. He acknowledged having doubts about whether he could regain his championship form.'
b'That sounds ludicrous now, with Djokovic in current possession of three of the four major trophies and needing only a French Open victory to complete a Novak Slam.'
b'After passing Sampras, Djokovic has no plans to slow down. Many players, Djokovic was told, believe that he can surpass Federer on the major victory list.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you live with that?\xe2\x80\x9d a reporter asked.'
b'Djokovic laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I live with that?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cJust fine.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 What better way to kick off Australia Day weekend than with a win-one, get-No. 1-free special at Melbourne Park?'
b'That will be the holiday bargain on offer inside Rod Laver Arena on Saturday when Petra Kvitova and Naomi Osaka square off in the Australian Open women\xe2\x80\x99s final for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup and the top spot in the women\xe2\x80\x99s world rankings.'
b'Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon titlist from the Czech Republic, advanced with a 7-6 (2), 6-0 defeat of the American Danielle Collins in the first of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s semifinals. Osaka, the reigning United States Open champion, engineered a 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Kvitova\xe2\x80\x99s compatriot Karolina Pliskova, who described Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s play as \xe2\x80\x9cunbelievable\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was not much that I could do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka, 21, can become the first Japanese singles player, male or female, to hold the No. 1 ranking, a piece of history that seemed well beyond her grasp last year at this time when she entered the tournament ranked No. 72.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course that\xe2\x80\x99s a very big deal for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just really happy that I\xe2\x80\x99m in the position that I am now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take it for granted.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kvitova, who rose as high as No. 2 in 2011, didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that No. 1 was within her reach here. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t really care, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Pointing to her head, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any room here to think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She feels especially blessed to be playing for another major title. This is her first Grand Slam final since she fought off a knife-wielding burglar in her Czech Republic apartment in 2016. She sustained nerve and tendon damage in all five fingers of her dominant left hand in the attack, requiring hours of surgery to repair and sidelining her from competition for five months.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know even if I was going to play tennis again,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only physically but mentally was very tough, as well. It took me really long while to believe.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Since returning for her self-described \xe2\x80\x9csecond career\xe2\x80\x9d at the 2017 French Open, the 28-year-old Kvitova has won seven tournaments, including five last year.'
b'The power game will be on display in this year\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s U. S. Open final when two of the hardest hitters in the game, Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, square off. It will be the first Grand Slam final for Osaka who has burst onto the scene with one of the most powerful forehands in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis.'
b'She started 2019 on a high note, prevailing in the tuneup event in Sydney. But for all her success, she had struggled in the majors; after winning Wimbledon for the second time in 2014, Kvitova didn\xe2\x80\x99t advance to the semifinals in her next 16 Grand Slams. Her best showing was two quarterfinal appearances at the U.S. Open.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor the mental side, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really easy to kind of deal with that every time, coming to the Grand Slam and losing,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s probably more sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka may be in her second consecutive major final, but she can remember when making it to the second week was a major victory. Before her breakthrough against Serena Williams last year in Flushing Meadows, Osaka lost in the third round of Grand Slams seven times and got as far as the fourth round only once.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMan, for me it feels like it took awhile,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. Laughing, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe my time goes slower than your time. But definitely I remember all the matches that I lost in the third round.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka used to become easily frustrated. The biggest change that her coach, Sascha Bajin, has noticed in this tournament is that she is controlling her emotions better when points don\xe2\x80\x99t go her way.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just have to tell her grass is green, water flows and everything is all right sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bajin said. \xe2\x80\x9cOver all, she\xe2\x80\x99s very hard on herself. She has very high expectations. She wants to do well. She wants to get better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kvitova was the same age that Osaka is now when she claimed her maiden Wimbledon crown, in 2011. Back then, her career stretched before her like a clear ribbon of highway. Sure, there were a few potholes, but nothing she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get past. Then came the attack in her apartment.'
b'Kvitova said she found out only recently that in the early months of her recovery, her doctor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t optimistic about her returning to competitive tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, like, during that period,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said.'
b'Last summer, Kvitova met Monica Seles, who arranged the introduction. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was such a nice feeling to meet someone who kind of went through same things and thoughts and everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said of Seles, who was stabbed by a spectator during a match in 1993.'
b'Seles returned to competition, and won the Australian Open in 1996 for her ninth major championship.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that, actually,\xe2\x80\x9d Kvitova said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice then.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Whatever happens Saturday, Kvitova feels as if she has already won. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be honest, I think not very many people believe that I can do that again, to stand on the court and play tennis and kind of play on this level.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the woman for whom the Australian Open women\xe2\x80\x99s singles trophy is named. She was Daphne Akhurst, not Akhurt.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 After 170th-ranked Christopher Eubanks made it through the qualifying draw of a Grand Slam event for the first time last week, many of his friends from back in Atlanta began to grasp how far his career had come.'
b'It was not because of the three qualifying matches he had won, but rather because of who joined him for a practice before the Australian Open began: Serena Williams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome of my friends who don\xe2\x80\x99t really know tennis were saying, \xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99s hitting with Serena, he must be pretty good,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Eubanks said.'
b'His session with her was part of a new strategy for Williams, who is training with some of the best current players from the men\xe2\x80\x99s tour to raise the intensity of her practices. In addition to Eubanks, Williams has practiced this month with No. 15 Stefanos Tsitsipas, No. 21 Grigor Dimitrov, No. 39 Frances Tiafoe and No. 88 Bernard Tomic.'
b'Asked about her practices with such players, Williams said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was fun,\xe2\x80\x9d but her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was more loquacious.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf she lifts her level on a daily basis that much, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to improve incredibly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The early returns from the strategy have been positive: Williams beat Eugenie Bouchard, 6-2, 6-2, in the second round on Thursday night, thwarting the resurgent Canadian with sharp, focused aggression. Williams was particularly strong on her return, winning 61 percent of points on Bouchard\xe2\x80\x99s serve.'
b'Mouratoglou said the shift to finding the best male opposition available was \xe2\x80\x9ca long-term plan,\xe2\x80\x9d not a temporary trend.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important in your practice to be challenged, because I think that she can become much better than what she is already,\xe2\x80\x9d Mouratoglou said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in order to become better, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not challenged, you have no chance. I thought that to be challenged at practice was a good idea, so we tried once and we really loved it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That first try, Mouratoglou said, was with the Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis last year at Mouratoglou\xe2\x80\x99s academy in France.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe said: \xe2\x80\x98Wow, it was great, great rhythm, and it\xe2\x80\x99s tough. It pushes me,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mouratoglou said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought she played incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kokkinakis, who had beaten Roger Federer earlier that spring at the Miami Open, shared that assessment, marveling at his inability to push Williams back from her position on the baseline even with his hardest, heaviest shots.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so, so strong on the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I thought I hit some good shots that even some male players might even struggle with, she took it on the rise, handled it pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams has practiced with men throughout her career, usually employing a man as a full-time hitting partner. Most have been years removed from their active days on tour and had achieved modest rankings. Her longtime hitting partner Sascha Bajin peaked at 1149th; his successor, Robbye Poole, reached 414th; her current hitting partner, Jarmere Jenkins, reached a high of 190th.'
b'Mouratoglou said that Jenkins was \xe2\x80\x9cstill hitting the ball really well,\xe2\x80\x9d but that it was important to shake Williams out of her routine with him when possible.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe basically knows where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit in advance, because she hits with him every day, so there is no surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d Mouratoglou said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that she\xe2\x80\x99s challenged because she knows him too well. I think that counts a lot. And she controls him, in a way, because he\xe2\x80\x99s her employee. Even unconsciously, she makes him play the way she wants to, even if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s completely different relationship with a professional player, because she has to give him good rhythm, to give a good ball to him, too, so she can\xe2\x80\x99t lose focus.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Other top men and women have shared practice courts in the first month of the tennis season. Andy Murray and Naomi Osaka, for example, hit together for 30 minutes at a tournament in Brisbane, Australia.'
b'Mouratoglou said that he emphasized to the men that they should not treat Williams differently from any other practice partner.'
b'He said he told Eubanks, \xe2\x80\x9cPlay for yourself \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s your practice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Eubanks said the session with Williams helped him in his first-round loss Monday against 19th-seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili. Eubanks had set points to go up by two sets to one on a player ranked 150 spots ahead of him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSerena hits, in my opinion, one of the cleanest balls in the history of tennis,\xe2\x80\x9d Eubanks said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was working on absorbing pace, because she puts enough pace on it that you\xe2\x80\x99re really working the legs. I\xe2\x80\x99m being as professional as I can, because you\xe2\x80\x99re on the court with Serena Williams. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to think you can\xe2\x80\x99t play.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Eubanks said he felt the effects of Williams\xe2\x80\x99s intensity and skill the rest of the day.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI practiced again in the evening, and I told my coach I felt like I did a lift today, because my quads are so sore from just hitting with her for an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'After Williams\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Bouchard, the on-court interviewer Jim Courier joked that she should charge the men she hits with for lessons. Indeed, many of Williams\xe2\x80\x99s past practice partners have been thriving in Melbourne: Tsitsipas, Tiafoe and Alexei Popyrin have reached the third round at the Open for the first time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust to hit with a legend, especially Serena, it really gave me a great, great experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Popyrin said after No. 7 Dominic Thiem retired from their second-round match Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me some tips after the hit, so it was great.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tiafoe, whom Williams hit with several times while they were teammates at the Hopman Cup, had his best career victory on Wednesday when he beat fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson in the second round.'
b'Tiafoe said he had difficulty handling Williams\xe2\x80\x99s zipping shots, as he was more used to the spinning shots male players tend to use.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was struggling,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said of hitting with Williams. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hits the ball so hard. The courts are fast; it was skidding. I mean, a little topspin, maybe? I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to the ball coming in that flat. That was something I really had to adjust to.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mouratoglou said no man had turned down an offer to hit with Williams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any will say no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great experience for them, too, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99re curious how Serena is hitting, for real.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For Eubanks, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s story had particular resonance. His father coached him in Atlanta following many of the tactics and philosophies of Serena\xe2\x80\x99s father, Richard Williams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBeing able to see somebody who comes from humble beginnings, somebody who has dealt with adversity her entire life, seeing someone who comes from an unconventional tennis background, it shows it can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to the point now where I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get star-struck when I see people,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve practiced with Fed a couple times. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Novak, seen Rafa. You see them and understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re people. But Serena, there\xe2\x80\x99s something about her that\xe2\x80\x99s almost larger than life. So when I got out there and she said my name, it took me back to as if I was a little kid: \xe2\x80\x98Man, Serena Williams knows my name!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Ann Chisholm contemplated traveling from her Minnesota home to watch the main-draw debut of her cousin Danielle Collins at the Australian Open, but it seemed like a flight of fancy. Collins had lost in the first round of the three majors she played last year, and it made little sense for a relative to travel 10,000 miles to see what might be only one match.'
b'But Chisholm continued monitoring airfares after each of Collins\xe2\x80\x99s first three matches in Melbourne, all victories. Then, in the fourth round, the unseeded Collins defeated Angelique Kerber, the 2016 champion and this year\xe2\x80\x99s No. 2 seed.'
b'It was just past 11 on Saturday night in Grand Rapids, Minn., when Collins sealed the upset, and Chisholm\xe2\x80\x99s inner voice, which had been nagging her for a week to hop on a plane, grew so loud she could hardly sleep.'
b'On Sunday morning, Chisholm reached out to Collins and said she was looking at flights to Australia. Chisholm didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her arrival to surprise Collins in case, she said, it \xe2\x80\x9cmessed up her mojo.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Collins reacted enthusiastically, Chisholm, who has four children, asked her husband and her mother if they would watch over things at home if she went away for a few days. Then she called a Delta Air Lines reservation agent, who pieced together a trip from Minneapolis to San Diego, then on to Los Angeles that would deliver her to Melbourne on Tuesday morning.'
b'Chisholm had about five minutes to pack for her journey to the Southern Hemisphere, not enough time to retrieve summer clothes from storage. So she threw some shirts and pants into a suitcase, and when her family left for church, she left for Australia.'
b'The trip went off without a hitch, and a few hours after landing here in Melbourne, Chisholm was in Collins\xe2\x80\x99s player box at Rod Laver Arena, transmitting positive vibes down to the court during Collins\xe2\x80\x99s 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.'
b'With the victory, Collins, 25, earned a semifinal meeting against Petra Kvitova, the eighth seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, who recently beat Collins in three sets in the first round of a tuneup event in Brisbane.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m representing the whole family,\xe2\x80\x9d Chisholm said.'
b'In St. Petersburg, Fla., Cathy Collins, a preschool teacher, managed a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep before her alarm went off a little after midnight, in time for her to watch television coverage of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s match. Collins\xe2\x80\x99s father, Walter, a landscaper, waited until after the match to sleep, taking what amounted to a power nap before starting work.'
b'The house where her parents live is the only place Collins has called home. Some of the neighbors have known her since she was born. A couple that lives across the street has been running over to celebrate every win with Collins\xe2\x80\x99s parents.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the doorbell rings in the middle of the night, we know who it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Cathy Collins said by telephone.'
b'It was a quarter to 8 on Tuesday morning, and Collins\xe2\x80\x99s mother would soon be corralling more than a dozen preschoolers. She had gone back to bed when her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s match was over, and woke up wondering if the victory had been a Technicolor dream.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s weird,\xe2\x80\x9d Cathy Collins said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Is my daughter really in the semifinals?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On the other side of the world, Collins described her father as \xe2\x80\x9cthe hardest worker I know\xe2\x80\x9d and marveled at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s stamina.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how my mom is managing,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not getting more than four or five hours of sleep on these match nights, and she\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with 15 3-year-olds. She\xe2\x80\x99s a trooper.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So is Collins, who was ranked 35th in the world coming into this tournament with an 0-5 record in Grand Slam matches. She seems unfazed.'
b'At Collins\xe2\x80\x99s post-match news conference Tuesday, a longtime tennis journalist from Europe began a question by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you understand that we are used to meeting players when they\xe2\x80\x99re kids. You are different from our point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He went on to compliment her maturity, which Collins attributes to a route less taken. Her family couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford the elite academies and junior circuits that mold small children into young professionals, so she went to college on an athletic scholarship to get her seasoning.'
b'She started at the University of Florida, then transferred to the University of Virginia. Collins won two N.C.A.A. singles titles while earning a degree in media studies and making lifelong friends, many of them non-athletes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think not being a child prodigy, not being a superstar at a young age, certainly humbled me, made me in a way work harder for things,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of made me hungrier in some ways, like not having that, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been really amazing at tennis.\xe2\x80\x99 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always like that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Collins comes across as feisty \xe2\x80\x94 her mother said she\xe2\x80\x99d had \xe2\x80\x9ca fighting spirit\xe2\x80\x9d since childhood. Collins also oozes confidence, regardless of circumstances.'
b'One of her favorite courses at Virginia was Denise Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to drama.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things she taught us is sometimes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to your job and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to sit in that cubicle when you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to for eight hours and fake it till you make it,\xe2\x80\x9d Collins said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so much of life is acting. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to always have a positive mind-set.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stewart said she was not surprised that Collins had found the big stage. Her success, she said, transcends tennis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is such the right woman at this time to say, \xe2\x80\x98Humble is not my jam,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Stewart said.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Serena Williams dressed for work on Tuesday as though she were intent on reminding people who she was before she became a wife and mother.'
b'The last time Williams graced Rod Laver Arena, in 2017, she dispatched her older sister Venus in the Australian Open women\xe2\x80\x99s final while in the early stages of her pregnancy. She was unable to defend her title last year because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to return to the tour after a harrowing medical ordeal during and after childbirth.'
b'In her return, 717 days later, Williams warmed up for her first-round match against Tatjana Maria wearing a short black trench coat. Once she got back to her chair, she peeled off the coat to reveal a muscle-hugging, bright green shorts-and-tank-top set that called to mind the black outfit that Williams wore 17 years ago in a first-round match at the United States Open.'
b'It was a bold fashion statement for the 37-year-old Williams, resurrecting the \xe2\x80\x9cSerena-tard,\xe2\x80\x9d as she called it, which she first made famous in 2002 when she had one of her most sublime seasons, with victories in the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open, and a 56-5 match record.'
b'Williams\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0, 6-2 victory against Maria, her friend and fellow mother, felt like it took place in 2002. She breezed through the opening set in 18 minutes and won 54 points to Maria\xe2\x80\x99s 24. Williams, the No. 16 seed, produced 22 winners.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working really, really hard in the off-season to be incredibly fit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Williams, who can equal Margaret Court\xe2\x80\x99s record 24 Grand Slam singles titles with a victory here.'
b'Maria said she hopes that Williams succeeds. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a lot of respect for her for what she\xe2\x80\x99s done in the sport,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I was a little bit overwhelmed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Maria and Williams live near each other in Florida and occasionally get together for barbecues, Maria said, but she did not feel comfortable on the Australian Open\xe2\x80\x99s main showcourt, which is like a second home to Williams, a seven-time champion. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find my rhythm,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria said.'
b'Williams eschewed interviews and kept a low profile in the lead-up to this tournament, her first since her unsettling defeat in the United States Open final last fall, where her outburst toward the chair umpire led to her being penalized a game and fined $17,000. While Williams and Maria warmed up before the match, the D.J. played snippets of songs that included Joan Jett\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBad Reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d If it was an attempt to get a rise out of Williams, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage.'
b'She spoke afterward about her dual focus \xe2\x80\x94 on tennis when she\xe2\x80\x99s on the court and on her 16-month-old daughter, Alexis Olympia, when she\xe2\x80\x99s not.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpending a lot of time with my daughter is a priority for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a working mom I feel guilty. I understand that\xe2\x80\x99s normal. These are years I\xe2\x80\x99ll never get back.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams can\xe2\x80\x99t get the time back that she took off from tennis after having a child. The best she can do is win the Australian Open title that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t defend last year, and to that end, she got off to a fast start.'

b"HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x94 Christian Garin of Chile won the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday for his first ATP World Tour title, beating Casper Ruud of Norway 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3 at River Oaks Country Club."
b"Nearly six years after winning the French Open Juniors title, the 22-year-old Garin finally broke through on the tour, spoiling Ruud's bid to become the first Norwegian winner."
b'"Casper\'s a really solid player," Garin said. "His forehand is getting better every day. It was a really intense match. What I did well today was to keep playing my game, every game of the match. I think I am playing my best tennis right now."'
b'Garin got the decisive service break for a 4-2 third-set lead when, ripping a blistering forehand approach shot, he coaxed Ruud into popping up a backhand volley he easily put away. Garin then easily served out in cool and breezy, but sunny conditions.'
b'"I\'m disappointed because it was a very close match and one break in the last set went his way," Ruud said. "I had some chances at 2-all. I tried to stay aggressive and play my game. I made a couple of unforced errors, but I can\'t be too disappointed because I went for winners and it was a great match overall."'
b'Garin will crack the top 50 in the world ranking for the first time.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 The undercard became the main event at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on Saturday.'
b'The crowd arrived eager to watch Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal renew their rivalry, a few fans having paid dearly to secure a final-hour ticket to Stadium 1.'
b'But Nadal, having tendinitis in his right knee, soon announced his withdrawal after testing the knee in a morning training session.'
b'The only men\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal to be played on Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open was between Dominic Thiem and Milos Raonic, and Thiem prevailed, 7-6 (3), 6-7 (3), 6-4, in a match of contrasting styles in which there was only one break of serve.'
b'That came at 2-2 in the third set when Thiem finally found a window of opportunity against Raonic\xe2\x80\x99s huge serve (and improved volleying). Raonic struck a forehand into the net while facing break point, and Thiem took it from there despite playing a relatively shaky final game in which he had to save the only break point he faced all afternoon.'
b'It will be Thiem versus Federer in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final. It will be the ninth final here in the desert for the fourth-seeded Federer, who has won the title five times but lost last year\xe2\x80\x99s final after squandering three match points against Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro.'
b'It will be the first final at Indian Wells for the seventh-seeded Thiem, and it could be quite an eye-catching duel given each man\xe2\x80\x99s flashy style and their 2-2 head-to-head record.'
b'But it will not generate the same sort of anticipation as a Federer-Nadal rematch. They have not faced each other in 17 months, and this would have been their 39th meeting in singles. But Nadal, who has had patellar tendinitis for years, felt fresh pain in the late stages of his quarterfinal victory over Karen Khachanov on Friday.'
b'Late on Saturday morning, Nadal texted his friendly rival Federer to let him know that he would not be able to play.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about only today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about what it means for me to have to pull out in a tournament that I love so much like this one, and in the semifinals after playing well during the whole tournament. You can imagine that I can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nadal also announced his withdrawal from the Miami Open, which begins next week and is one of the few significant events he has not won. His decision not to play on Saturday was also made with the goal of preserving his clay-court season. An 11-time French Open singles champion and the most successful clay-court player ever, Nadal said he fully expected to be ready to play on clay in Monte Carlo next month.'
b'Federer, 37, appeared in the stadium after the Thiem-Raonic match to give an on-court interview for the fans. Nadal leads their rivalry, 23-15, but Federer has won five straight, most recently in the final of the Shanghai Masters in 2017.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had so many epic battles, and yes, I know that everyone we have now could be our last,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo was this our chance for the last one? I really hope not, and I really believe at the level he\xe2\x80\x99s playing and I\xe2\x80\x99m still going, there are definitely going to be more.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'For Serbs living in Australia, Djokovic is a sporting hero who provides a connection to their culture and tradition. '
b'By Karen Crouse'
b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Novak Djokovic, the men\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 1 from Serbia, has been lifting up people from his homeland for years, but not usually like this. At the end of a practice session during last year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open, Djokovic walked over to a waist-high fence where fans were packed 10-deep to watch him and hoisted a boy from the front of the crowd over the barricade and onto the court.'
b'That boy, 8-year-old Novak Pokrajac, then got to play a few points with the man for whom he was named, including a 29-shot rally that ended with him hitting an overhead smash past Djokovic for a winner.'
b'Both Novaks are back at Melbourne Park this year \xe2\x80\x94 Djokovic, 31, is seeking his seventh Australian Open title and 15th Grand Slam trophy, and Pokrajac, 9, is hoping to entice Djokovic into a practice-court rematch.'
b'For the tens of thousands of Australians of Serbian descent, Djokovic is the secular saint of sport, worshiped by Serbs who still feel an acute sense of persecution nearly two decades after the worst of the Balkans\xe2\x80\x99 fractious ethnic violence. That was evident on Wednesday afternoon, when Djokovic hit with the Australian teenager Alexei Popyrin in front of a crowd that included about a dozen fans flying the red, blue and white colors of the Serbian flag. '
b'Even during the 50 weeks of the year when the Melbourne Park courts go quiet, Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s presence looms. In the office off the Serbian Voice, a weekly newspaper on the western edge of Melbourne, one wall serves as a shrine to celebrated Serbian figures from history: Serbian Orthodox Church figures; Vuk Karadzic, the creator of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet; Nikola Tesla, the Serbian-American inventor; and Djokovic. '
b'For Serbia, a nation of seven million people, it is \xe2\x80\x9ca big deal\xe2\x80\x9d to be able to claim the top-ranked player in men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis \xe2\x80\x94 and one of the best ever \xe2\x80\x94 said Zeljko Prodanovic, the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the war, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy to say, \xe2\x80\x98Here we are,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at the movies, Serbs are always the bad guys. But now we can say we have the best tennis player in the world. That makes us proud.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Zivana Jovanovic, has welcomed several Serbian luminaries to her office in her two decades at the helm, including the actor Dragan Nikolic and the retired N.B.A. player Vlade Divac. She has never met Djokovic but said she felt as if she knows him because of his high profile. For all his fame, Jovanovic said, Djokovic comes across as humble. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI like that about him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t let all his success go to his head.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity status has made it hard for him to move freely in public in Melbourne, but in his younger days he had regular haunts: a church where he would ring in the Orthodox New Year, or the restaurants on Lygon Street, known for its outdoor cafes and European eateries. Now, though, when Djokovic ventures out into the city, as he did before the tournament for a photo opportunity for one of his sponsors, he is swarmed by admirers.'
b'Still, Djokovic said he tries to meet and chat with Serbs wherever he goes and invite them to watch him play.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it nurtures the culture and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMe as one of the athletes from our country that is internationally successful, I feel there is also a responsibility to represent the country in a right way. For a lot of those people, especially who live here, they have not seen or been to Serbia for a long time. So for them it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a treat to have me playing here and other tennis players from Serbia.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Michael Popovic, a middle-aged Serb who emigrated from Belgrade to Melbourne in his 20s, was at Rod Laver Arena in 2008 when Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals to reach the final, where he would defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for his first major title. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe feeling I had at that moment was very hard to describe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Popovic, a restaurateur. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like I just won.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Popovic owns Mediterraneo, a restaurant on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood south of the city center that specializes in steak and seafood. The restaurant also offers vegan and gluten-free dishes \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of Novak,\xe2\x80\x9d Popovic said, referring to Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s decision several years ago to overhaul his diet.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI serve Serbian burgers with no bread crumbs,\xe2\x80\x9d Popovic added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was Novak\xe2\x80\x99s influence, also.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But the only Djokovic whom Popovic has served is Novak\xe2\x80\x99s uncle Goran. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had the pleasure of having Novak here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'That nearly changed last weekend, when a large party of Serbs \xe2\x80\x94 including the pro Janko Tipsarevic, who every year distributes tournament tickets to the local Serbian community through one of his friends \xe2\x80\x94 stopped in for dinner. Djokovic was supposed to join them, but long after they had been seated, they received a text from him saying they should eat without him because he was stuck in meetings related to his responsibilities as the president of the ATP Player Council.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d Popovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was really hoping he would come.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On Monday, Pokrajac, the young fan, made sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss Djokovic, arriving at Melbourne Park with his mother, Snezana, more than an hour before the player was scheduled to practice. He wanted to claim a prime viewing spot, up against the fence again. The night before, Pokrajac said, he had imagined getting to hit again with Djokovic, borrowing a technique that has served him well in his matches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I visualize something before,\xe2\x80\x9d Pokrajac said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Djokovic finished practicing, Pokrajac shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember me, Novak? I\xe2\x80\x99m here from Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic remembered. He came over, hoisted Pokrajac over the fence again, handed him a racket, and they began to hit. They played four \xe2\x80\x9cpoints.\xe2\x80\x9d The second rally was 34 shots; the fourth ended on the 16th, when Pokrajac hit a half-volley for a winner.'
b'His prize was a hug and a signed T-shirt from Djokovic, who also offered a tip on how to return a slice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me to get lower,\xe2\x80\x9d Pokrajac said.'
b'Two days later, Pokrajac staked out his same spot. He unfurled a Serbian flag that he had signed and which he intended to present to Djokovic as a parting gift. After his session, Djokovic came over and accepted the flag. He read what Pokrajac had written: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Novak from Novak from Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d Under his signature Pokrajac had written, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be worth gold money\xe2\x80\x9d and added a smiley face.'
b'Djokovic hugged him. As Pokrajac turned to rejoin his mother, his smile was incandescent.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I know him,\xe2\x80\x9d Pokrajac said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be friends now.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 In what is usually one of his most successful stretches of the season, top-ranked Novak Djokovic fell short of expectations for the second time this month, losing, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, to No. 22 Roberto Bautista Agut in the fourth round of the Miami Open on Tuesday afternoon.'
b'After gaining a foothold in the match early in the second set, Bautista Agut endured a 40-minute rain delay before drawing level. After breaking for a 3-1 advantage, Bautista Agut dropped his serve but then broke Djokovic again immediately, extending his lead to 5-2 before the two traded holds to finish the match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe key of the match was at the beginning of the second set, no?\xe2\x80\x9d Bautista Agut said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I wanted to win the match, I had to be very close at the score. Otherwise Novak, when he gets an advantage, he plays really aggressive.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Indeed, Djokovic had never previously lost a match at the Miami Open after winning the first set, a string of 41 matches.'
b'His advantage looked even more secure when he broke Bautista Agut in the first game of the second set, but Djokovic could not hold in the next game.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI lost the momentum,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI lost the rhythm in the second set. I gave him a little room to step in, and he did. A little hope that he can come back, and he made a great comeback. But fault is on me, for sure. I had way too many opportunities that I wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic, a six-time champion in Miami, came into the tournament with little momentum, having lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Indian Wells, a tournament where he is a five-time champion.'
b'The stumbles have come unexpectedly for Djokovic, who had appeared untouchable as he finished his run to a seventh Australian Open title in January, finishing off the major with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Rafael Nadal in the final.'
b'Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s inability to dominate has been consistent with the parity on tour this season: The 19 ATP tournaments this season have each been won by a different man. While Djokovic is still a clear leader of the pack in the rankings, his leadership role off the court has perhaps hampered that status.'
b'Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, has spent these tournaments embroiled in a back room imbroglio over the ATP board\xe2\x80\x99s contentious decision not to renew the contract of the chief executive, Chris Kermode.'
b'Though Djokovic initially refuted a suggestion that those things had disrupted his play, he ultimately conceded that the distractions had been detrimental.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just had way too many things off the court,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that affected me a little bit on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was Bautista Agut\xe2\x80\x99s third win over Djokovic in 10 matches. He also defeated him in their most recent meeting in January, in the semifinals of the ATP tournament in Doha, Qatar.'
b'Bautista Agut converted 4 of 7 break point opportunities on Tuesday, compared with 4 of 13 for Djokovic.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis kind of match I should not have lost,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many opportunities. Just way too many wasted opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'ISNER ADVANCES; KYRGIOS LOSES The defending champion John Isner reached the Miami Open quarterfinals with a 7-6(5), 7-6(3) win over Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Kyle Edmund on Tuesday, while Nick Kyrgios, in a loss to Brona Coric, was given a point penalty for an audible obscenity.'
b'The obscenity by Kyrgios, who produced perhaps the shot of the tournament early in his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 loss to the 11th-seeded Coric, was apparently directed at a spectator. The penalty put him down a double break in the third set.'
b'Up next for Coric will be a clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat No. 17 Nikoloz Basilashvili, 7-6(4) 6-4, to become the first qualifier to reach the last eight in Miami since Guillermo Canas in 2007. Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, also became the first player born in the 2000s to reach a Masters quarterfinal.'
b'Isner, known for his serve, fired 17 aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set through three matches in Miami. He will next face Bautista Agut. (REUTERS)'
b'KVITOVA ATTACKER SENTENCED A man who stabbed the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in her home was sentenced to eight years in prison on Tuesday.'
b'Radim Zondra, 33, was convicted of causing Kvitova serious bodily harm by a regional court in Brno, Czech Republic.'
b'The state prosecutor requested 12 years for Zondra, who pleaded not guilty to attacking Kvitova in December 2016 in her apartment in Prostejov.'
b'Kvitova\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, Karel Tejkal, said she \xe2\x80\x9crespects the ruling of an independent court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied with the verdict because she identified the convicted person as the attacker,\xe2\x80\x9d Tejkal said.'
b'Zondra can appeal, and so can the prosecution. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)'

b'Naomi Osaka, the No. 1-ranked player in the world, announced on Monday that she was splitting with her coach, Sascha Bajin, abruptly ending one of the most successful recent partnerships in women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis at what seemed to be a high point.'
b'Hey everyone, I will no longer be working together with Sascha. I thank him for his work and wish him all the best in the future.'
b'The surprising announcement came just 16 days after Osaka won the Australian Open, her second major title under Bajin\xe2\x80\x99s watch. The win vaulted her to the No. 1 ranking, a first for an Asian player on the men\xe2\x80\x99s or women\xe2\x80\x99s singles tours.'
b'Bajin, who became a coach after serving as the longtime hitting partner of Serena Williams, was named the WTA\xe2\x80\x99s Coach of the Year in 2018. He responded on Twitter to Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.'
b'Osaka, 21, was ranked 68th when she hired Bajin in the lead-up to the 2018 season, giving him his first head coaching role. She quickly surged under his guidance, reaching the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time at the 2018 Australian Open, and then winning her first professional singles title at Indian Wells, Calif., in March.'
b'Osaka beat Williams, her idol, for the first time in her next match in the first round of the Miami Open, and then memorably beat her again six months later in the final of the U.S. Open, a victory which took her into the top-10 for the first time.'
b'The reasons for the split were unclear. Bajin did not respond to messages seeking comment, and Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Stuart Duguid, declined to comment.'
b'Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s split from Bajin is the latest on a coaches\xe2\x80\x99 carousel in which success has not guaranteed longevity in player-coach partnerships. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s French Open champion, Simona Halep, and the Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, parted with their coaches at the end of last season, meaning that the reigning champions of the past four Grand Slam events are no longer with the coaches who helped them to those titles.'
b'Halep, ranked third, is now working with Thierry Van Cleemput, who split with his longtime charge David Goffin at the Australian Open.'
b'Osaka, who has not yet named a successor to Bajin, will play her first match as WTA No. 1 next week in Dubai. It will be her first time as the No. 1 seed at any WTA event.'
b'Asked after the Australian Open final what advice Bajin had given her before the match, Osaka smiled and said she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, no, like we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really been talking, to be honest, like before any of my matches here,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would tell me, like, one thing, then I would be, like, \xe2\x80\x98O.K.\xe2\x80\x99 That was it.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The athletes \xe2\x80\x94 including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd \xe2\x80\x94 are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutionalized gender discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d as my colleague Andy Das reported.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,\xe2\x80\x9d Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.'

b'The issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer\xe2\x80\x99s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. '
b'Here are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.'
b'The U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women\xe2\x80\x99s title. The men\xe2\x80\x99s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.\xe2\x80\x9dIn 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.'

b"The Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men\xe2\x80\x99s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women\xe2\x80\x99s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women\xe2\x80\x99s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women's Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled \xe2\x80\x9cWimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I\xe2\x80\x99m Only a Second Class Champion.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men\xe2\x80\x99s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men\xe2\x80\x99s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. \xe2\x80\x9cThe stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis matches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'The W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities \xe2\x80\x94 though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.'
b'Last summer, A\xe2\x80\x99ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. \xe2\x80\x9cMust be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.'
b'U.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women\xe2\x80\x99s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women\xe2\x80\x99s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to do the fair thing, and the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 not just for hockey but for all women,\xe2\x80\x9d Meghan Duggan, the team\xe2\x80\x99s captain, said at the time.'

b'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 In a short stretch of Saturday afternoon, the Miami Open lost two of its biggest attractions \xe2\x80\x94 and just held on to a third. Top-ranked Naomi Osaka lost her third-round match, 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3 to 27th-seeded Hsieh Su-wei. Midway through Osaka\xe2\x80\x99s match, Serena Williams, an eight-time tournament champion, unexpectedly withdrew, citing a left knee injury.'
b'Osaka, who had emerged as the sport\xe2\x80\x99s best front-runner, had won 63 straight matches when winning the first set, dating to 2016. Osaka also led early in the third set, 2-0, before Hsieh leveled and then took a 4-3 lead she did not let go. Hsieh, a crafty 33-year-old veteran, closed out the victory on her first match point, hitting an overhead smash that Osaka blocked back, and then finishing off the point with an unreturnable slice volley.'
b'Osaka had beaten Hsieh earlier this year in the third round of the Australian Open, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. Hsieh has used her unorthodox game of jabs and feints to establish a reputation as a giant killer; she knocked then-No. 1 Simona Halep out of the third round of Wimbledon last year.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s always great to pick up a better level during the match,\xe2\x80\x9d Hsieh said in her on-court interview. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it and you beat a good player, you feel, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, this is everything. This is so amazing, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka, in her typically introspective way, admitted that she had \xe2\x80\x9coverestimated\xe2\x80\x9d herself in several ways, like thinking she could afford to turn her intensity on and off during matches and judging how well she has been handing the pressure of holding the No. 1 ranking.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was doing fine with that, but I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Osaka, who has a 3-3 record since assuming the top spot, which she may lose depending on the results of other top players in this event. \xe2\x80\x9cI think more about winning now.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The 10th-seeded Williams, who last won the Miami Open in 2015, was to face 18th-seeded Wang Qiang in a third-round match Sunday. Wang receives a walkover into the fourth round, where she will await the winner between Wang Yafan and 25th-seeded Danielle Collins.'
b'It was the third consecutive tournament in which Williams\xe2\x80\x99s body let her down before her racket did. Williams, 37, was forced to retire midway through her second match in Indian Wells, Calif., earlier this month because of a viral illness. In the Australian Open quarterfinals in January, Williams was leading Karolina Pliskova, 5-1, in the third set when she twisted her ankle on match point. Though she had more match point opportunities, the injury particularly encumbered Williams\xe2\x80\x99s serve, causing her to lose all 10 subsequent points in her service games.'
b'After receiving a bye in the first round of the Miami Open, Williams survived an up-and-down second-round match against 63rd-ranked Rebecca Peterson on Friday afternoon. She had not appeared encumbered by her knee, though she did struggle with blinding glare that shone on her side of the court for part of the match, through gaps at Hard Rock Stadium which is hosting tennis for the first time. Williams survived with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 victory but was not happy with her performance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI need to just move on and really focus on playing better \xe2\x80\x94 or not be in the tournament much longer,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said in her postmatch news conference.'
b'Osaka will next play at the WTA tournament in Stuttgart, Germany, in April, but where Williams will play next is unclear. The next mandatory WTA event for top players is the Madrid Open in May, though Williams has not played there since 2015. Williams did not play any clay court tournaments before the French Open last year, as she focused on improving her conditioning and losing weight she had gained during and after her pregnancy.'
b'That sort of selectivity in scheduling, long a staple of Williams\xe2\x80\x99s career, has increased in recent years, when she has focused more and more on Grand Slam events.'
b'In the men\xe2\x80\x99s draw, Roger Federer avoided being a third high-profile casualty at the tournament on Saturday when he rallied to beat Radu Albot of Moldova, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Federer, 37, acknowledged some fuzziness on his tactics against Albot, who won the nearby Delray Beach ATP tournament last month.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed very clear to me, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the heat of the moment, I started forgetting stuff also that my coach told me.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Early in his quarterfinal match at the Australian Open on Tuesday, Frances Tiafoe, part of a new generation of male stars who have emerged for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament, faced a break point against his battle-tested opponent.'
b'But Rafael Nadal, of course, is not just any opponent. He is the No. 2 seed, a champion in Melbourne in 2009, the owner of 17 Grand Slam titles and as punishing a player as ever at age 32.'
b'Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s return of serve came back powerfully, pushing the 21-year-old Tiafoe far to his backhand side for a meager reply. And with that, Nadal, as he did during the entire span of a vintage and coldly efficient victory, had put his opponent on an energy-sapping, confidence-draining string.'
b'The exchange ended, mercifully, with a booming Nadal down-the-line forehand, which the powerfully built Tiafoe sent meekly into the net.'
b'Two games into a much-anticipated fight, Tiafoe\xe2\x80\x99s serve had been broken, his fighting spirit dealt a severe blow.'
b'After winning that first break point, Nadal never looked back. Roughly 90 minutes later, the scoreboard flashed the result: 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.'
b'Earlier, another rising star had done what Tiafoe could not, beating his elder to reach the semifinals. Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, defeated the 30-year-old Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2), several hours before Nadal and Tiafoe took the court.'
b'But with Nadal\xe2\x80\x99s win at Rod Laver Arena, a measure of order was restored by a member of the old guard.'
b'Buoyant on court after the match, Nadal told the crowd that he had recently joked that the tour\xe2\x80\x99s young challengers could wait awhile before challenging for tennis supremacy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut looks that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are there, no?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In this tournament, Nadal has also beaten Alex de Minaur, the 19-year-old new hope of Australia. In the semifinals on Thursday, he will play Tsitsipas.'
b'Tsitsipas, seeded 14th and the first Greek player to make a serious dent in the pro game, is among the clutch of college-age players heralded by the ATP Tour as eventual successors to the four aging kings of the sport: Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, who have won virtually every Grand Slam singles title since 2003.'
b'They will not be able to defy time forever. Case in point: Murray, the three-time major champion, a former No. 1 and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced at the start of this tournament that his days as a player may end at this year\xe2\x80\x99s Wimbledon, if not sooner.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like a fairytale,\xe2\x80\x9d Tsitsipas said in a post-match interview.'
b'As he spoke, inside the stadium and out, rowdy fans, many from Melbourne\xe2\x80\x99s large Greek population, chanted songs and danced \xe2\x80\x94 as they have all tournament long.'
b'With his flowing locks and scythe-like, one-handed backhand, Tsitsipas had proved himself a legitimate threat to win here when he blunted Federer on center stage Sunday night.'
b'The upset \xe2\x80\x9cgot people\xe2\x80\x99s attention,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy biggest challenge was to stay concentrated, stay focused\xe2\x80\x9d in order to prove the win over Federer was no fluke.'
b'Tiafoe \xe2\x80\x94 known as \xe2\x80\x9cBig Foe,\xe2\x80\x9d and one of the few black players on tour \xe2\x80\x94 could not come close to duplicating Tsitsipas\xe2\x80\x99s effort. Before playing Nadal, the young American seemed to be playing with the form and confidence that would give him a chance for a monumental upset of his own. He had scored three straight surprising wins against higher-ranked players, including one over the No. 5 seed, Kevin Anderson. He had also gained an avid following with his vivacious on-court persona and post-match celebrations \xe2\x80\x94 taking off his shirt and pounding his chest, mimicking his favorite N.B.A. players.'
b'His hope against Nadal was that his young legs would push him past a champion who has won 80 tour titles in a career of nearly two decades.'
b'Add to that: Maybe, just maybe, Nadal would break down on the unforgiving hard court, a surface that has taken a toll on his body.'
b'After all, Nadal completed just one hard court event last year. At the Australian Open, he retired during the fifth set of his quarterfinal against Marin Cilic, because of an upper leg injury. At the United States Open in September, he retired again, this time because of a knee injury during a semifinal against Juan Mart\xc3\xadn del Potro.'
b'Nadal took the rest of the year off and had ankle surgery. Then, after he arrived in Australia, he withdrew from a warm-up event in Brisbane because of a left thigh injury.'
b'But at Melbourne Park this year, he looks refreshed. His movement is fluid. His ball striking has looked as crisp and powerful as ever.'
b'Tiafoe spoke to this, offering a view of what it\xe2\x80\x99s like from the distressed other side of the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he was going to bring crazy intensity,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiafoe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew the ball was going to be jumping.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew if he got hold of a forehand, it was going to be barbecue chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, resorting to a culinary metaphor to describe how he felt after just a few points: cooked.'
b'Keenly aware of how small the margins between winning and losing are at this level, Nadal slightly altered his service motion during the off-season. He cut down on his backswing to gain more efficient power. He said after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s match that he had also worked on finishing points earlier than usual, to reduce the wear on his body.'
b'There is still much tennis to be played in this tournament. Novak Djokovic, the firmly entrenched No. 1 player, remains on the other side of the draw. He and Nadal could meet in the final here for the second time, a rematch of 2012, when Djokovic won in a nearly six-hour marathon.'
b'But first things first, and for Nadal that means facing Tsitsipas, another chance for the old guard to keep a youthful challenger at bay.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Top-ranked Simona Halep expressed relief and satisfaction after her third-round victory over Venus Williams on Saturday night at the Australian Open. She also remained galvanized for the task ahead \xe2\x80\x94 a fourth-round match on Monday against Venus\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Serena.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always a big challenge to play against the Williams sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep said in her on-court interview after her 6-2, 6-3 victory over Venus. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I was super-motivated today.\xe2\x80\x9d As she will have to be on Monday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely is the toughest draw I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep said.'
b'Though Halep arrived at Melbourne without a victory since August, she has impressed in her first three matches here. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she played pretty flawless today,\xe2\x80\x9d was the assessment from Venus Williams after the match.'
b'Serena Williams, meanwhile, easily won her third-round match \xe2\x80\x94 6-2, 6-1 over Dayana Yastremska \xe2\x80\x94 and then expressed eagerness for the chance to test herself against the No. 1-ranked Halep.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI honestly would love to face the world No. 1,\xe2\x80\x9d said Williams, adding that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t faced a No. 1 since her return from maternity leave last year. Actually, Williams has actually not faced a No. 1 player in nearly six years \xe2\x80\x94 largely because you can\xe2\x80\x99t be across the net from the No. 1 when you are the No. 1.'
b'Williams\xe2\x80\x99s last match against a top-ranked player was against Victoria Azarenka in February 2013 in the Doha final. Though Williams lost that match, she secured the No. 1 ranking by reaching the semifinals of that tournament and she then held onto it for 186 weeks, through the 2016 U.S. Open, when she ceded it to Angelique Kerber.'
b'Despite her two runs to Grand Slam finals last year, Williams has not beaten many high-profile opponents since her return. She is 1-3 against top-10 players in that span, with the lone victory coming last year against Karolina Pliskova in the United States Open quarterfinals.'
b'Still, Williams is considered the player to beat at every tournament she enters. And according to the player who has spent the last 48 weeks atop the rankings, she\xe2\x80\x99s still the best in the world.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, to be No. 1 in the world and to be the best player in the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit different,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this moment, I\xe2\x80\x99m No. 1 in the world, so I will take that. I have been there many months, many weeks.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut for sure she\xe2\x80\x99s the best player in the world because she won so many Grand Slams,\xe2\x80\x9d Halep added in reference to Williams, who is a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot on No. 1. I cannot compare my results to her. But in this moment, I am confident that I am in this position, and I\xe2\x80\x99m positive about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Monday\xe2\x80\x99s blockbuster match is a product of a draw that has been almost devoid of major upsets, with seven of the top eight women reaching the fourth round (No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki lost to five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova in the third round).'
b'That steadiness by the favorites represents an abrupt arrival of order to women\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Slam tennis: at Wimbledon last year, only one of the top eight reached the fourth round; at the United States Open, only three did.'
b'Pliskova, the only player seeded in the top 8 to make the second week at the last three Grand Slams, could face the winner of the Halep-Williams match in the quarterfinals. She is looking forward to which of the two it might be.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor sure, the best match now in the draw,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said.'
b'The men have also had a steady ride to the round of 16, with six of the top eight seeded players reaching the second week, including the top four.'
b'But those four all have tough challenges directly ahead of them. The top-seeded player, Novak Djokovic, faces No. 15 Daniil Medvedev, whose ranking has soared from No. 65 since the beginning of last season. Rafael Nadal, who is seeded No. 2, faces resurgent veteran Tomas Berdych, who beat him in straight sets here in 2015, which was their most recent meeting on hard courts.'
b'Roger Federer, seeded No. 3, faces No. 14 Stefanos Tsitsipas, the young Greek who won the ATP\xe2\x80\x99s Next Gen competition in Milan in November. And the player seeded No. 4, Alexander Zverev, faces No. 16 Milos Raonic, who has already knocked out Nick Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka en route to the second week.'
b'Though all dangerous, none of those men face a challenge quite like the one that Serena Williams presents to Halep. Halep is 1-8 against Williams, with her lone win coming via a 6-0, 6-2 blitz in the round-robin stage of the 2014 WTA championships in Singapore. Williams avenged that loss, 6-3, 6-0, in the final days later.'
b'Halep said she would be used to the pressure of facing Williams when they meet here on Monday and hoped she would able to play the same sort of assertive, proactive tennis she deployed against Venus.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in a good position,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel confident. I played very well today. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the same against her. I will wait. I will focus on myself \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And Halep, who has kept a markedly positive attitude throughout the tournament, said there would be something positive resulting from the match, regardless of the outcome. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always great to play against Serena,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause every time, I have something to learn.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 This is a story about Roger Federer\xe2\x80\x99s third-round match. Only it is not about Roger Federer.'
b'It is about a young upstart on the men\xe2\x80\x99s tennis tour, a lanky power-hitting Californian who possesses skill and promise and a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 stacked with solid but not spectacular results.'
b'At Rod Laver Arena this Friday afternoon, the education of Taylor Fritz took a significant, though bruising, step forward. This was a graduate level course held in front of 15,000 fans, taught with calculating precision by a 37-year-old Swiss who has won 20 Grand Slam titles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a real lesson,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz said, once the match was done. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be better because of this match, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fritz, who is 21 and considered to be one of the most promising players in the game, had come to this Australian Open match on the heels of the biggest Grand Slam victory of his career: a tense, hard-fought win over the 30th-seeded Frenchman Ga\xc3\xabl Monfils.'
b'After that match, though he was playing as confidently as he ever had, Fritz was cleareyed about his slim chances against an all-time great like Federer. He noted how his only previous meeting with Federer had been a battle that went to the later stage of a tight third set. Then Fritz had crumbled.'
b'This time, though aware of the long odds against him, Fritz vowed to play loose and relaxed. \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay my game, hit big.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted to soak up the moment, and learn.'
b'At 1 p.m. on a muggy afternoon, Fritz finally took the court at Rod Laver Arena. He had never played there. He smiled tightly. He fidgeted with his brown hair and white headband. His mind raced.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of thoughts going on in my head,\xe2\x80\x9d he would explain, noting that he had simultaneously tried to pump himself up and find calm by listening to rap on his headphones as he strode before the fans.'
b'Then the warm-up began. It was impossible to miss the fact that Fritz\xe2\x80\x99s introduction took just a few seconds. When Federer\xe2\x80\x99s followed, crackling over the public address system, it was a condensed version of the Swiss star\xe2\x80\x99s achievements. Even shortened, it took a full minute.'
b'Now the match was on, and it was clear from the beginning that Federer considered Fritz dangerous. He had reason to. In that one and only meeting, in Stuttgart, Germany, in the summer of 2016, Federer had emerged victorious, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Hardly smooth sailing. Federer seemed determined not to let Fritz get that close again.'
b'So, from the start, Federer displayed the fullness of his range. There were sharp angles and booming drives. There were heavily spinning forehands followed by balls that cut flat against the hot air. It was a level of play Federer will need if he is to win this tournament for a third straight time, and a seventh over all.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since I have gotten a beat-down like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz told me, unspooling the entire experience once it was done. \xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel great, not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The first set took 20 minutes. Federer: 6-1.'
b'In the second set, Fritz fared better. He began using the leverage from his 6-foot-4-inch frame. With Federer serving, Fritz nudged ahead in a key game. Federer responded with a pair of scorching forehand winners and a curveball ace.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI get any of those points and I have a break point, a chance to break him and a chance to serve for the set,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz said.'
b'There was resignation in his eyes. But also a glint of hope. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, with someone as good as Roger, you know that might be the only chance you get,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see now that you have to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He certainly did soak up the moment. He loved every part of playing in front of a crowd that large. He tried a bit of showmanship, on one point faking as if he was going down the line, then hitting crosscourt. Problem was, Federer caught up to the ball, responded with a fake of his own and hit a winner.'
b'Fritz had been posterized.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tried to play with him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand, well, he played me back.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Then he spoke of his last stand. Of trying to simply survive. \xe2\x80\x9cRegroup, hold serve, hold serve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said he kept telling himself, like a mantra.'
b'It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Everyone could feel it, most notably his opponent. \xe2\x80\x9cFederer was rolling,\xe2\x80\x9d Fritz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it so many times before, on TV. Once he is in front, he smothers you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The end was inevitable. The final score: 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.'
b'Next up for Federer is the round of 16, and another dangerous young player: Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 20-year-old from Greece, part of a group of 23-and-under men making waves in Melbourne. The American Frances Tiafoe, who turns 21 on Sunday, is in the fourth round of a major for the first time after following his upset of fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson with a five-set win over Andreas Seppi on Friday.'
b'Taylor Fritz, meantime, will return to California, itching for more center courts, more Grand Slam tournaments, more matches against the very best. Against Federer, he experienced aspects of tennis that, if copied, will add significantly to his growth. How to disrupt timing. When to use angles. The way pouncing on the slimmest openings can change tone.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was such a learning experience for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI plan to take it and get better, get more comfortable in these moments, so I can play the way I know I can play. I plan to use this as a steppingstone.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'After spending 2018 rapidly ascending the global tennis ranks, Aryna Sabalenka decided to spend some of her brief off-season in free fall. So during a winter visit to Dubai, Sabalenka said, she took the opportunity to bungee jump from 41 floors up.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese three seconds before you jump, it\xe2\x80\x99s like something unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabalenka, a 20-year-old Belarusian, said in a recent telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to cry, smile and laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The daring off-season activity underscored the intensity and cheerfulness that came to define Sabalenka as she burst onto the scene last year, winning her first two WTA titles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s always very friendly,\xe2\x80\x9d said her coach, Dmitry Tursunov. \xe2\x80\x9cShe likes to be in a good mood.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'She also likes to win, and she has started where she left off after her breakthrough campaign, becoming the first WTA titlist of 2019 by defeating Alison Riske, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, in the final of the tournament in Shenzhen, China, on Saturday.'
b'Now Sabalenka can add one more label: dark horse to win the Australian Open, where she could establish herself not just as an up-and-comer but as one of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s pacesetters.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you here, right now, that the winner of the Australian Open women\xe2\x80\x99s side is going to be Sabalenka, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d the ESPN analyst Patrick McEnroe told reporters this week. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to win the Australian Open.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The title in Shenzhen helped her return to a career-best ranking of No. 11 on the eve of the year\xe2\x80\x99s first Grand Slam tournament. And despite a stumble at her next tournament \xe2\x80\x94 a first-round loss to eighth-ranked Petra Kvitova in Sydney \xe2\x80\x94 Sabalenka\xe2\x80\x99s recent tear has put her on more than one list of Australian Open favorites.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the top 20 players, especially with her age, she is probably the most dangerous one right now because of the power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sophie Amiach, a former Australian Open quarterfinalist in singles and doubles who is now an analyst for the WTA\xe2\x80\x99s world feed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides the given, Serena, everybody else, the power is there, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s as much as what she has,\xe2\x80\x9d Amiach added, referring to Serena Williams, who is seeking to equal Margaret Court\xe2\x80\x99s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.'
b'But the overwhelming force that has fueled Sabalenka\xe2\x80\x99s rise can also be difficult to harness at times. Her serves and forehands can misfire by yards, and her shot selection is sometimes questionable. Seesaw matches proved a mainstay for Sabalenka in 2018, leading to a WTA-high 29 third sets contested.'
b'That inconsistency might have been what prompted a bit of criticism from President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus when he met Sabalenka in November.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy with your performance,\xe2\x80\x9d he was quoted saying by the news agency BeITA, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept for several moments when the ball went out of court while you could keep it in the game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But like her fellow rising star Naomi Osaka, 21, Sabalenka has started to rein in her game while still blasting winners. It helped Sabalenka, the only player to take a set off Osaka during her run to the United States Open title last fall, rise to No. 13 by the end of 2018 after beginning the year ranked 73rd. Her eight wins over top-10 players last year \xe2\x80\x94 all after June \xe2\x80\x94 placed her behind only Kiki Bertens and Elina Svitolina.'
b'And Sabalenka toppled Svitolina, the eventual champion at the WTA Finals in October, on the way to her biggest title, in Wuhan, China, a month earlier.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a quick learner, but I feel also she is a quick learner because she is passionate about it and wants to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tursunov, who used a similarly powerful style to win seven ATP titles in his career. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think that kind of summarizes her improvement.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Before he became Sabalenka\xe2\x80\x99s coach during the summer grass-court swing last year, Tursunov had already been impressed by his future charge\xe2\x80\x99s performance and attitude as he observed her on tour.'
b'At last year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., Tursunov looked on as the player he was then coaching, Elena Vesnina, faced Sabalenka and her countrywoman Victoria Azarenka in a doubles match with Ekaterina Makarova. Vesnina and Makarova, the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s top seeds, prevailed, 6-4, 6-3.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get fazed when she was being rifled at,\xe2\x80\x9d Tursunov said, \xe2\x80\x9cand a few times they were just going at her and knocked her down on her butt. She was kind of sitting and giggling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThose are the things that just kind of stuck in my mind. The way she was handling tough situations, and situations where she was being outplayed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Sabalenka attributes some of that mental toughness to her roots in Belarus. Money was scarce, so she did not compete in any junior Grand Slam events and participated in just four tournaments outside Europe.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI could play tennis, but no one believed in me that much,\xe2\x80\x9d Sabalenka said. \xe2\x80\x9cActually I think this kind of thing helped me to improve my game.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBefore, I was actually upset with it. They think I am not the best player, and it made me work extra hard and improve my game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was with the Belarusian Fed Cup team, however, that Sabalenka emerged on the broader scene, in 2017. Belarus advanced to the final, with Sabalenka and Aliaksandra Sasnovich falling to the Americans Shelby Rogers and CoCo Vandeweghe in the deciding doubles match in Minsk.'
b'Even as her ranking climbs and her goals become loftier, Sabalenka said she did not intend to skip the Fed Cup series. Her energy seems to resonate throughout the squad.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe is always fighting, so when playing on a team with her, you just cannot go down, because you are just getting involved in this flow she creates,\xe2\x80\x9d Vera Lapko, her fellow 20-year-old Belarusian, said in an email.'
b'Neither that grit nor the smiles will escape Sabalenka anytime soon.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m smiling and laughing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be too serious because this is not me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the result of a match between Aryna Sabalenka and Kiki Bertens in Fed Cup in 2017. Sabalenka held a match point against Bertens; she did not win the match. And the match was in the first round, not the semifinals.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Serena Williams was one point from the Australian Open semifinals when she lost her footing and the match slipped away.'
b'Williams, who was seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title, lost the final six games to fall, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, to Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday, relinquishing her lead after rolling her left ankle when the match was within her reach.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was almost in the locker room, but now I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here as a winner,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said in her on-court interview after the match. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a really good feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams, known more for improbable comebacks than collapses, had not lost a Grand Slam match after holding a match point since the 2010 French Open.'
b'Pliskova, the No. 7 seed, will face the fourth-seeded Naomi Osaka in the semifinals on Thursday. The other semifinal pits the eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova against the unseeded American Danielle Collins.'
b'This was Williams\xe2\x80\x99s fourth major tournament since resuming her career in 2018 after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September 2017. Williams withdrew before the fourth round of last year\xe2\x80\x99s French Open because of an injury and lost in two other Grand Slam finals \xe2\x80\x94 to Anqelique Kerber at Wimbledon and to Osaka at the United States Open in a match remembered primarily for Williams\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation with the chair umpire, which cost her a game penalty.'
b'Williams, who dispatched the top-seeded Simona Halep in a hard-fought, fourth-round match, has not defeated two top-10 players at the same event since returning from her pregnancy. She has spoken candidly about her struggles to return to peak physical condition after giving birth, and she arrived here looking fitter than she had since before her pregnancy.'
b'Williams, 37, has not reached for excuses, even when she has struggled in ways she had not before leaving the tour to become a mother.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Day 1, I expect to go out and, quite frankly, to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened. But I do like my attitude. I like that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go out here and say, \xe2\x80\x98I expect to lose because I had a year off, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing for 10 months, I\xe2\x80\x99m not supposed to win.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'While Williams\xe2\x80\x99s mind-set has been positive, on Wednesday her body betrayed her and the match suddenly pivoted in Pliskova\xe2\x80\x99s favor.'
b'Her match turned in an instant. With a commanding 5-1 lead in the third set, the 16th-seeded Williams held a match point on her serve, at 40-30. But after she was called for a foot fault on her first serve, Williams appeared to sustain an injury in the rally that began off her second serve, rolling her left ankle as she tried to change directions to reach a shot from Pliskova.'
b'Williams lost the point, and then the next two points. She did not call a medical timeout on the ensuing changeover, but she retied her shoelaces, making them tighter.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI really hate calling the trainer out, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd at that point I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I needed it or I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it would be a big deal. So I just kept going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But the tighter shoes did not keep her in the match. Pliskova won the next two games, pulling to 4-5, suddenly back on serve. Williams earned three more match points in the 10th game, but Pliskova saved them all.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98All right, here we go, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to win one of these,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, but I was just trying at that point.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pliskova held on to make it 5-5 with a backhand cross-court winner, punctuated with a loud and long scream.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, suddenly, I got a chance too,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said of her improbable victory after facing four match points. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how it is in tennis. You need luck, of course, because this is \xe2\x80\x94 I think \xe2\x80\x94 not happening often. Maybe once in life. But I went for it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams, who like all right-handers lands on her left foot when she serves, lost all 10 remaining points on her serve after the injury. While she said she would not know how bad her ankle injury was until a day later, she played down the effect of the injury on the outcome of the match, repeatedly giving Pliskova credit for playing \xe2\x80\x9clights out\xe2\x80\x9d tennis as she surged back.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think she just played well on my serve after that point,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she just kind of started playing really, really good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it had anything to do with my ankle, per se. I just think she was just nailing and hitting shots. Obviously I made some mistakes, but she played really well after that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pliskova said she thought something might have happened to Williams, but that she remained focused on her own side of the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is happening on the other side, I just try to block it,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said. \xe2\x80\x9cEither it\xe2\x80\x99s positive or negative, whatever is there, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not my business. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is. I know once I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think about that, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Pliskova won the next two games to complete the improbable comeback, winning after Williams hit a forehand into the net for an unforced error on her third match point.'
b'Pliskova, a former No. 1, had knocked Williams out of a Grand Slam event before, beating her in straight sets in the 2016 United States Open semifinals. She had looked on track for a similarly efficient victory when she broke Williams for a 3-2 lead in the second set.'
b'But Williams roared back, breaking Pliskova at love in the next game, beginning a stretch of winning 9 of 11 games and taking complete command of the match before her late collapse.'
b'Pliskova, whose appearance in the 2016 United States Open final was her only previous major title match, has won two of her previous three matches against Osaka. She most recently beat her 6-4, 6-4 in the final of the WTA tournament in Tokyo in September.'
b'Osaka, 21, will be seeking a second straight Grand Slam title. She reached the semifinals with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over the sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina.'
b'Osaka, who had never reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam before her triumph in New York last fall, said she was keeping this accomplishment in perspective.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo be here is something that a lot of people want, and I know that a few months ago I would have given anything to be in the semifinals of a slam,\xe2\x80\x9d Osaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s this weird feeling of: You want to do the next big thing. And especially now that I won a Grand Slam, and I feel like I want to win another one, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so close and I just want to keep going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Osaka and Kvitova could each claim the No. 1 ranking for the first time if they win the tournament on Saturday. After pulling herself from the brink of defeat, Pliskova also has a chance to return to the No. 1 ranking with a victory, even if she had begun to count herself out of the tournament when she was one point from defeat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind was in the locker room,\xe2\x80\x9d Pliskova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was still here.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For Williams, who has the trophy as her goal every time she arrives at a Grand Slam event, her quest to match Margaret Court\xe2\x80\x99s 24 singles Grand Slam titles will resume at the French Open in May.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9dI mean, the big picture for me is always winning,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sit here and lie about that. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet, but I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen. Just keep taking it one match at a time, just keep soldiering on, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'UNIONDALE, N.Y. \xe2\x80\x94 The second edition of the New York Open concluded on Sunday with a pair of unexpected players engaging in a tense and memorable final that provided enough excitement to make up for the lack of star power.'
b'The organizers of the event, which moved to Long Island last year after 40 years in Memphis, might have hoped for more marketable names to highlight the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s final days to help lift the profile of the tour stop.'
b'After all, neither Reilly Opelka nor Brayden Schnur were among the seven players featured on the promotional posters used to advertise the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s return to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. But Opelka and Schnur provided plenty of buzz for the 3,128 fans who showed up for the final.'
b'The tension peaked with a nerve-racking replay after a challenge on the 15th point of the third-set tiebreaker. On the next point, Opelka finished off Schnur, 6-1, 6-7 (7), 7-6 (7), for his first ATP Tour-level title.'
b'Opelka, 21, has won challenger tournaments at the lower levels of the professional tour, and he won the juniors title at Wimbledon in 2015. But this was the breakthrough he and many of his supporters had anticipated for some time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is definitely my biggest title yet, the one I\xe2\x80\x99m most proud of, for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Opelka said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of years coming.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It did not come easy. Schnur saved five match points and appeared to have a match point of his own when he served what seemed to be an ace at 7-7 in the tiebreaker of the decisive set. But Opelka challenged the call, and the serve was ruled out by perhaps a millimeter.'
b'Schnur, who had never even won an ATP Tour-level match before arriving in New York (he was 0 for 5), then missed his second serve for a double fault. At 8-7, Opelka ripped an ace out wide to win the match.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat challenge was probably the difference in the match,\xe2\x80\x9d Opelka said.'
b'At 6 feet 11 inches with a booming serve, Opelka is expected to rise to No. 56 from No. 89 when the new rankings come out. Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s result will also bolster his status as a potential heir to John Isner, the current top-ranked American male player, whom Opelka has beaten twice in a row.'
b'Opelka downed the top-seeded Isner in their hard-hitting semifinal encounter Saturday night as the two set a record with 81 combined aces in a three-set match. That was a repeat of Opelka\xe2\x80\x99s surprise victory over the 6-10 Isner in the first round of the Australian Open last month.'
b'Opelka\xe2\x80\x99s close victory on the black wooden courts at the Coliseum denied Schnur, a 23-year-old from Canada, what would have been an even more improbable victory.'
b'A qualifier with a head cold, Schnur arrived in New York last week without a guaranteed spot in the draw.'
b'He had reached a career-high ranking of 154th leading up to the New York Open, but he nearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to play a single point here. He was granted the last alternate spot in the qualifying draw, and he won two matches there to advance to the main draw. There he upset the third-seeded Steve Johnson and the sixth-seeded Sam Querrey as he earned four straight victories to reach the final.'
b'Though generally unknown, Schnur, a former college player at the University of North Carolina who was born in Pickering, Ontario, has one attribute that will endear him to those who want pro tennis to speed up: He does not bounce the ball before serving. Most players bounce it at least a few times, and some, like Rafael Nadal, sometimes bounce it repeatedly, to the chagrin of some opponents and spectators.'
b'Schnur stands at the baseline, waits for his opponent to get into the ready position, and then simply tosses the ball into the air and slams away. He started doing it that way, he said, while playing on the uneven grass at warm-up tournaments ahead of Wimbledon. Schnur said the unpredictable bounces left him scrambling to catch up to the ball and adversely affected his rhythm.'
b'The emotions of the breakthrough week seemed to catch up to Schnur on Sunday as he fought back tears in his postmatch speech to fans and later during his news conference.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a handful of people know how hard I really worked for this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the most talented guy out on the court.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Schnur\xe2\x80\x99s and Opelka\xe2\x80\x99s paths to the final were relatively smooth, as the Open\xe2\x80\x99s field of players didn\xe2\x80\x99t include many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top-ranked individuals. But attendance was up compared with last year, according to Josh Ripple, the tournament director, both over all and for the final; in last year\xe2\x80\x99s final, Kevin Anderson beat Querrey.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe did better by every metric,\xe2\x80\x9d Ripple said, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding attendance and revenue, and 2020 will be the pivotal year for us.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'If Opelka comes back, he probably will make it onto the poster.'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 The beginning of a calendar year normally would seem a strange time to be preoccupied with endings. But when Andy Murray tearfully announced his impending retirement because of a deteriorating right hip in a pretournament news conference, the Australian Open underwent a jarring mood swing, from the so-called Happy Slam to a major dominated by talk about pain management and the sometimes extraordinary measures required to prolong careers.'
b'The Hospice Slam, anyone?'
b'The 31-year-old Murray, a three-time major winner, missed the tournament last year because of hip surgery that did not alleviate his suffering. On Monday, he valiantly battled the pain and his opponent, Roberto Bautista Agut, for more than four hours before losing in five sets.'
b'Rafael Nadal, 32, who secured a spot in the second round against Matthew Ebden, described how his crumbling knees and various other injuries have forced him to adjust his practice schedule based on his \xe2\x80\x9cbody feelings\xe2\x80\x9d and to adopt a faster, more aggressive serve to try to shorten points.'
b'The five-time major winner Maria Sharapova, 31, easily dispatched Harriet Dart, then spoke about how the shoulder pain that has plagued her for 10 years forced her to accept the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not immortal; you\xe2\x80\x99re never going to play this forever.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Then there was Caroline Wozniacki, who is still in her twenties but already managing her own health crisis. Wozniacki, 28, returned to Rod Laver Arena for her first-round match against Alison Van Uytvanck looking outwardly the same as she did when she outlasted Simona Halep on the same stage last year to win her first Grand Slam title.'
b'Wozniacki ran down drop shots and prevailed in most of the rallies of more than nine shots in a 6-3, 6-4 victory that belied the extra effort now required for her to maintain her competitive edge. Last summer Wozniacki learned she had rheumatoid arthritis, a condition linked to immune system dysfunction. As Wozniacki explained it, her immune system attacks healthy tissue in and around the joints of her hands, knees and feet, causing rashes, inflammation and fatigue.'
b'The diagnosis forced Wozniacki to overhaul her routine to include more massages, less (or at least smarter) tennis, more rest, less sugar, more stretching and less jogging.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to the body, you try different things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are days I wake up and don\xe2\x80\x99t feel great, and when that happens, I\xe2\x80\x99m still going to go out there and do my thing, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to taper it down. And I know in my head I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to go full-out today and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make me feel worse tomorrow. I\xe2\x80\x99ve matured a lot. That\xe2\x80\x99s never how I used to think.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable to hear so many prominent players give voice to their vulnerabilities. As Murray acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re going to compete, you want to be positive and optimistic about things because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be telling your opponents, the guys you\xe2\x80\x99re competing against, how bad you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'His Friday news conference announcing his retirement, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwas kind of the first time I kind of came out and let everyone know how bad it\xe2\x80\x99s been and tough.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wozniacki was the same way. She knew before last year\xe2\x80\x99s United States Open that the flulike symptoms that had plagued her all summer were, in fact, signs of something more serious. But she said nothing about her condition for two months, waiting until the news conference after her final match of the season, in Singapore in October, to reveal the diagnosis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give anyone the edge,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said.'
b'She rejected the notion that a full disclosure of her health woes would have benefited her by moderating external expectations.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think because I\xe2\x80\x99m such a competitor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to be an excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI know myself and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done out there. I\xe2\x80\x99m either proud of myself for giving it my all, or I can be disappointed because I thought I could do better, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really need the sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wozniacki followed her Australian Open title with two more victories, in a pre-Wimbledon tuneup at Eastbourne in June and a Premier Mandatory event in Beijing in October \xe2\x80\x94 both, she said, while exhibiting one or more of the textbook symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The Beijing win was especially satisfying, Wozniacki said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, will I ever be able to play six matches in a row? That really gave me the confidence, you know, if I can do this I can do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Wimbledon, where Wozniacki lost in the second round, the rest of her summer passed in a fog of inconclusive doctor visits and inexplicable early-round losses. Wozniacki withdrew from the tournament in Washington because of pain in her knees. In her next tournament, in Montreal, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in her first match and awoke the next morning unable to lift her arms to brush her teeth. From there, it was on to Cincinnati, where she retired after the first set of her first match because she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the energy to soldier on.'
b'Everywhere Wozniacki went, she saw doctors, she said, who proclaimed her fit and sent her away with medication for a head cold or influenza.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors did blood tests, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t addressing the inflammation, which was the weird thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wozniacki, who found it stranger still that after years of wearing opponents down with her fitness, she was the one tiring first in her matches.'
b'From Cincinnati, Wozniacki traveled to New York, where she maintains an apartment, and insisted on undergoing a comprehensive battery of tests, one of which came back positive for rheumatoid arthritis. Wozniacki was relieved finally to have a diagnosis but refrained from reading up on the disease, she said, because she wanted to focus on the United States Open.'
b'After her second-round loss to Lesia Tsurenko, Wozniacki typed \xe2\x80\x9crheumatoid arthritis\xe2\x80\x9d into a search engine on her phone during the ride back to her apartment and quickly educated herself on this new and formidable opponent. She made an appointment to see a New York-based rheumatologist, who assuaged her fears.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe said a lot of people she works with can live a normal life with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said.'
b'Of course, Wozniacki\xe2\x80\x99s physically challenging, globe-trotting existence is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a normal life.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI asked her: \xe2\x80\x98What about my tennis? What about my career?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to figure it out.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In Monday\xe2\x80\x99s match, Wozniacki expressed surprise at Van Uytvanck\xe2\x80\x99s tactic of hitting drop shots from behind the baseline, as if to test her speed and stamina.'
b'But Wozniacki figured it out and hit a few back for winners. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, I actually got to them, hit it well, I kind of complimented myself on a couple of them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a laugh, not bothering to disguise her delight in showing how much life is left in her wheels.'

b'INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 After another day of big serves and topspin forehands in the desert sunshine, just about everyone appeared to get what they wanted: a 39th match between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.'
b'The question is, will it actually happen?'
b'Federer, despite being the elder at 37, looks readier to rumble. Between Dubai and Indian Wells, he has won nine straight matches and 15 straight sets and artfully and uneventfully dispatched the unseeded Hubert Hurkacz, 6-4, 6-4, in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s first quarterfinal of the BNP Paribas Open.'
b'But Nadal had to dig much deeper to wriggle free of the firm grip and aggressive game of Karen Khachanov, the brawny young Russian who pushed him hard in the third round of last year\xe2\x80\x99s United States Open.'
b'This time, Nadal prevailed, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), but only after Khachanov stretched him repeatedly with huge serves and whipping forehands and only after Nadal needed on-court treatment and tape for pain in his long-troublesome right knee.'
b'And there lies the problem with planning your day or, depending on the time zone, your night around watching No. 39.'
b'Nadal remains one of the greatest, in-the-moment competitors in any sport, but his recent record in hardcourt tournaments is a downbeat litany of withdrawals, retirements and anticlimaxes.'
b'It remains an open question if he will feel hearty enough to play Saturday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s semifinal. He does not have a day off to recover. He also has the rest of the 2019 season to consider, including his sacrosanct season within a season on clay that is scheduled to start next month in Monte Carlo.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course my goal and my idea is to be ready for tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said after pursing his lips and shaking his head.'
b'But he also knows from long experience with patellar tendinitis that being ready is no sure thing.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot guarantee how I will feel when I wake up tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the desire to play a match like this against Federer is always very special, and it\xe2\x80\x99s even more special if we\xe2\x80\x99re both at a high level and at 100 percent. Hopefully it will be that way, above all for me but also for the fans on site and for fans in general. I hope I will be able to play aggressively. I need to be ready to react very quickly and to have everything in place to be able to succeed. If not, it will be very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nadal and Federer first played in Miami in 2004, but they have not met since October 2017, when Federer beat Nadal in the final of the Shanghai Masters. Federer went 5-0 against Nadal in 2017, a resurgent season for both men, after upgrading his ability to attack with his single-handed backhand.'
b'That run of success has narrowed the big edge that Nadal once held in their rivalry; he now leads by 23-15.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think those five matches matter that much, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said of the 2017 victories. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of time has gone by, unfortunately maybe for the rivalry for us, or for me. It\xe2\x80\x99s always better to keep on maybe playing against him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Federer started this season by failing to retain his title at the Australian Open but has responded by going on a roll. After winning his 100th career title in Dubai, Federer is now two victories from his 101st. To get there, he may first have to deal with the man who has been his friendly rival for 15 years and who remains a friend: The two had coffee at Federer\xe2\x80\x99s rented home last week to discuss the state of the tennis world.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent styles, different ways to understand the sport,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the same time, two players with a good relationship after all the things that we went through in our careers, competing for the most important things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In his first match against Hurkacz, a rangy and powerful 22-year-old from Poland, Federer looked loose from the start as he tested the full range of his skill set.'
b'There was the usual: wickedly sliced backhands, blocked returns and first serve-forehand combination punches. There was also the unusual: chip and charge tactics, serve-and-volley on second serve and no-look flicked backhand overheads.'
b'But it will be hard to be quite so relaxed and experimental against Nadal, whose ability (when healthy) to extend rallies and take command of them with his left-handed, topspin forehand is an entirely different, though much more familiar, challenge.'
b'The two did not play any of the same regular ATP Tour events in 2018, and they did not face off in the three Grand Slam tournaments that they both played: the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.'
b'Federer was asked if, after all these years, the matchup with Nadal still gave him more of a thrill than facing an unknown rising player.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think a combination,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was only Rafa, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy that as well. I think having the mix is the magic really for me. Playing against young guys to eventually get to Rafa, that\xe2\x80\x99s exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was quite an achievement for Nadal to get to Federer through the 22-year-old Khachanov. He was visibly hampered by his knee trouble, which first required treatment on court with Khachanov leading by 2-1 in the second set. Visibly slower and unable to push off as powerfully with his legs to serve, he still found a way to grind and win.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a special victory considering the way I was feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadal said.'
b'Playing with pain has unfortunately become close to the rule on hardcourts for Nadal, who has long complained and warned about the physical toll of hardcourt play.'
b'Nadal, 32, conceded that part of the problem was playing more than 1,100 matches in his career, not just playing on hardcourts. But he also pointed out that other sports tended to be played regularly on grass or on other more forgiving surfaces.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love to play on hard, but probably my body doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love it that much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my feeling is there are a lot of players that love to play on hard, true, but their bodies don\xe2\x80\x99t love to play on hard, either.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He is also concerned about the price he and others might pay in retirement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I see some old legends walking around the tour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s tough.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 There\xe2\x80\x99s no rewinding the results in sports, as New Orleans fans still fuming about last week\xe2\x80\x99s N.F.C. Championship game can attest. But sometimes, as Sam Stosur proved Friday at the Australian Open, it is possible to get it right the second time.'
b'In 2006, Stosur, a Queenslander playing in the women\xe2\x80\x99s doubles final in her home Grand Slam, lost her service while attempting to close out the match in the second set. Stosur and her doubles partner, Lisa Raymond, squandered two championship points on their way to a three-set defeat to the Chinese team of Yan Zi and Zheng Jie.'
b'Thirteen years later, Stosur was back in the women\xe2\x80\x99s doubles final, this time alongside China\xe2\x80\x99s Zhang Shuai. They were playing the defending champions, Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, and again Stosur was serving in the second set to close out the match.'
b'Stosur earned a championship point, which she squandered with a double fault. But the past doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be prologue. On the next point, Stosur produced an overhead winner to end a 25-shot rally. Then she watched the 13th shot of the next point sail long, near her feet, to seal her 6-3, 6-4 victory with Zhang at Rod Laver Arena.'
b'It was sweet redemption for Stosur, not only because of her near miss in 2006 but also because of all her quick exits here in the singles competition. Since defeating Serena Williams in the final to win the 2011 United States Open, Stosur, 34, has exited in the first round in singles in this tournament five times, including the past four years.'
b'Stosur held her head high after her latest opening-round defeat, last week in straight sets to Dayana Yastremska, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, of whom she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very good player.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stosur, who won the mixed doubles here in 2005 with Scott Draper, immediately turned her attention to the women\xe2\x80\x99s doubles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think probably for any singles player, playing doubles can almost feel more relaxing or more fun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'In Zhang, Stosur found a partner whose wit is as sharp as her net play. She kept Stosur loose \xe2\x80\x94 and occasionally made her laugh out loud \xe2\x80\x94 with her on-court comments. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we could transfer that a little bit into the singles court, that would be a good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Stosur said.'
b'Zhang, 30, had exited in the first round in singles in all 14 majors she had played and was contemplating retirement in early 2016 when Stosur sent her a long and passionate text encouraging her to continue playing. Zhang then advanced to the quarterfinals in singles at the 2016 Australian Open as a qualifier \xe2\x80\x94 still her best finish in singles in a major \xe2\x80\x94 and now, on the strength of Stosur\xe2\x80\x99s powers of persuasion, she can call herself a Grand Slam champion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cReally important message,\xe2\x80\x9d Zhang said, smiling, of Stosur\xe2\x80\x99s long-ago text.'
b'These two weeks, Zhang added, have been the most \xe2\x80\x9camazing in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stosur said she had been in communication with Raymond, who told her the other night in a text: \xe2\x80\x9cGo get it 13 years later. Get it now.\xe2\x80\x9d Stosur said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was really nice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The stands were roughly half full for the final but wholly behind Stosur and Zhang, ringing the stadium with chants of \xe2\x80\x9cAussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou guys definitely are in a good mood right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mladenovic said to the crowd during the on-court trophy presentation. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not our goal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The walk from the court to the locker room took Stosur and Zhang nearly as long as Stosur\xe2\x80\x99s opening service game, which lasted 10 minutes, because every few steps she was stopped by well-wishers. Tournament workers applauded when Stosur emerged from a media-center elevator, and she received more applause from reporters as soon as she stepped inside the main interview room.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think to be able to play at home is super exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d Stosur said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can feel my phone going off every two seconds at the moment. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to know that the support\xe2\x80\x99s there from everyone that\xe2\x80\x99s close to you, but also feeling it from people you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know who are happy and excited, it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Maria Sharapova walked up to the dais as if she were walking into a bash. She wore a black crop top that fell to her waist and tights that were shimmery and chic.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t pull those out too often,\xe2\x80\x9d she chirped to a roomful of reporters, referring to the top. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really happy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Known for her frosty reserve on the court, Sharapova was in a celebratory mood on Friday after dispatching the reigning champion and No. 3 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, in a third-round grudge match.'
b'Wozniacki, who is friends with the other women on the tour, and Sharapova, who keeps her competitors at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, are one-time Australian Open winners and full-time adversaries. Their clashing personalities don\xe2\x80\x99t account for why they approached every point in the 2-hour, 24-minute slugfest as if they were playing for the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup instead of a berth in the round of 16.'
b'At this tournament in 2016, Sharapova, the 2008 champion from Russia, tested positive for meldonium, which had been newly added to the sport\xe2\x80\x99s banned substances list. Sharapova, who has steadfastly maintained that she was unaware of the change in the drug\xe2\x80\x99s status, received a two-year ban that later was reduced to 15 months.'
b'When Sharapova returned to competition in 2017, many players, including Wozniacki of Denmark, were critical of her receiving wild cards and other forms of what they considered preferential treatment. That year, the animus between the pair seeped into the United States Open after Sharapova played a second-round match at Arthur Ashe Stadium while the much higher-seeded Wozniacki was relegated on the same day to an outside court, where she lost.'
b'In an interview afterward with a Danish newspaper, Wozniacki questioned putting \xe2\x80\x9csomeone who comes back from a drugs sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d as she worded it, on the main show court. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t set a good example,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'When Wozniacki\xe2\x80\x99s comments were later relayed to her, Sharapova said it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter where she played, because all she cared about was that she was still in the tournament. Without mentioning Wozniacki by name, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where she is.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Friday\xe2\x80\x99s match at Rod Laver Arena was the 11th competitive meeting between Wozniacki and Sharapova, who holds a 7-4 edge. But it was the first time they\xe2\x80\x99d played since Sharapova\xe2\x80\x99s suspension.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was definitely, you know, a match that I looked forward to when the draw came out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sharapova, who conspicuously avoided looking at Wozniacki \xe2\x80\x94 and vice versa \xe2\x80\x94 during the prematch coin toss.'
b'But when they returned to the net nearly three hours later for the handshake, they made eye contact, two warriors to the battle born. Wozniacki\xe2\x80\x99s strength is blasting balls from the baseline until her opponent blinks and, true to form, she engaged Sharapova in 23 rallies of at least nine shots. Sharapova won 17 of those points, including a 23-shot rally in the eighth game of the first set.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the rallies that I think many years ago that she used to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Sharapova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I did a great job of getting a higher percentage of wins in those.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wozniacki had one forehand winner in the first two sets (to Sharapova\xe2\x80\x99s 17) and prevailed in the second set despite hitting just one winner, off her backhand.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I did my best out there,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was fighting till the end.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Even as Wozniacki raced out to a 4-1 lead in the first set, she appeared to be long on guile and grit but short on gas. One of her second serves was clocked at 73 m.p.h. \xe2\x80\x94 and came back to her at 82 m.p.h.'
b'Wozniacki, 28, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis before last year\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. Open, and Friday\xe2\x80\x99s weather, which included rain and some thunder and lightning, presented perfect conditions for a flare-up. In Wozniacki\xe2\x80\x99s postmatch news conference, a reporter, who identified herself as a rheumatoid arthritis sufferer, said she had been in quite a bit of discomfort because of the weather and asked Wozniacki about her pain levels.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m O.K.,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to blame it on anything else. You know, she was just a little bit better than me today. And that was really it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wozniacki, who returned to the top of the women\xe2\x80\x99s world rankings with her victory here last year, will tumble out of the top five when the new rankings come out after the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion. She was asked if Friday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat stung any less because she would forevermore be known as a major champion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a competitor,\xe2\x80\x9d Wozniacki said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate losing more than I love winning. Obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here and you\xe2\x80\x99re a little sad. But, you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s what drives you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The 31-year-old Sharapova regularly fields questions about her motivation. Her 2018 season ended prematurely, in September, after her surgically repaired right shoulder started giving her fits. According to Forbes, Sharapova, a five-time major winner who has completed the career Grand Slam, has earned more than $280 million in her career. With an ostrich-size nest egg, why does she persist with the constant travel and daily grind?'
b'The answer is simple, Sharapova said: For days like this.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt very much in the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt present.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Sharapova added, \xe2\x80\x9cTo be in the grind of things and to really have to figure out a way to be on top is what I missed.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never done this before,\xe2\x80\x9d Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said as she climbed on a stationary bike in front of a crowd that didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that much smaller than the one that had watched her 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3 upset of fifth-seeded Sloane Stephens at the Australian Open.'
b'The fourth-round match ended six minutes before 2 a.m. on Monday morning, and Pavlyuchenkova was mentally making a list of all the tasks that stood between her and a good morning\xe2\x80\x99s sleep: the stationary bike, the reporters with their notebooks and microphones, the ice bath, the shower, the change of clothes, the drive back to the hotel.'
b'Pavlyuchenkova asked if she could field questions from reporters while she pedaled so she could kill two tasks with one bike ride. She was so tired, she had struggled to construct her points on the court, and now she was having trouble organizing her thoughts in front of reporters.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what a starting time of nearly half-past 11 will do to a player. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s honestly terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d Pavlyuchenkova said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal time to play tennis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Describing the match, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was like, \xe2\x80\x98This match is so intense, why am I like still sometimes feeling like I\xe2\x80\x99m going to fall asleep now?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The late, late, late show, with hosts Pavlyuchenkova and Stephens, started Sunday and ended Monday. Nine matches in the first eight days of the tournament ended after midnight, but Pavlyuchenkova\xe2\x80\x99s win over Stephens wasn\xe2\x80\x99t close to being the latest finish.'
b'It was 12 minutes past 3 a.m. on Friday when Garbi\xc3\xb1e Muguruza clinched her second-round match against Johanna Konta. By the time Muguruza met with her coach, showered, changed out of her tennis outfit, received a massage, fulfilled her media obligations and returned to her hotel, it was one hour before sunrise.'
b'And Muguruza\xe2\x80\x99s match wasn\xe2\x80\x99t close to being the latest-ever finish in Australian Open history; that feather is in the pillows of Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, whose third-round slugfest here in 2008, won by Hewitt, ended at 4:33 in the morning.'
b'The prime-time television hours in Muguruza\xe2\x80\x99s native Spain are from 10:30 p.m. until 1 a.m., so she knows from flawed time systems.'
b'And yet, Muguruza, 25, readily acknowledged that playing that late \xe2\x80\x9cis not normal.\xe2\x80\x9d She added, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very awkward.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The post-midnight hours would pose no problem if the players had the body clocks of the mostly nocturnal koala bear, who can sleep up to 22 hours. But the human body\xe2\x80\x99s inner clock has a circadian low, a window roughly between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., when focus, strength, reaction time and physical flexibility ebb, the better to promote sleep.'
b'The circadian rhythm can be reset by changing sleep or eating patterns. But how can players adjust their internal clocks for optimal performance when they\xe2\x80\x99re playing at 2 a.m. one day and at 2 p.m. another?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way to train that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria Sharapova, who advanced to the third round in a match that ended at 12:36 a.m. \xe2\x80\x94 or roughly two hours past her preferred bedtime.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask any player that goes into this tournament how many times they have trained after midnight, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re jet lagged or just crazy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t train for that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On the same night that Muguruza barely beat both Konta and daybreak, Novak Djokovic outlasted Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a match that ended 41 minutes past midnight. Djokovic, the men\xe2\x80\x99s world No. 1, has a reputation for leaving few routes unexplored to gain a competitive edge. Over the years he has tried hyperbaric chambers, yoga, meditation, biofeedback and restrictive diets.'
b'So is he crazy enough to have tried practicing after midnight?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not done that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think ever,\xe2\x80\x9d Djokovic said.'
b'He added with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not doing push-ups at midnight before I go to sleep. You train a bit later, and the whole routine is pushed back a little bit. But you also want to get a good night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep so your biological rhythm keeps going in the right way.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Djokovic has one strategy, grudgingly adopted, that helps him sleep longer and sounder during tournaments: he leaves his two small children at home. He may be on to something. Norah Simpson, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford who studies the role of sleep on athletic performance, recommends that players get good, quality sleep in the days before matches so they don\xe2\x80\x99t go into a late-night match already sleep-deprived.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very challenging to navigate the variable schedule in respect to both your internal clock and the amount of sleep you\xe2\x80\x99re able to obtain,\xe2\x80\x9d Simpson said in a telephone interview.'
b'The potential for late-night matches is part of tournaments with stadium lights and no curfews. Madison Keys played mostly night matches on her way to the final at the 2017 United States Open, and recalled going to bed after 4 a.m. many mornings, waking up around noon and taking power naps whenever she could. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not natural,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I know I\xe2\x80\x99m playing a night match, I sleep as much as I can the day before.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova\xe2\x80\x99s coach, Simon Goffin, encouraged her to stay up until 1 a.m. the night before playing Stephens to help reset her body clock.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI pushed her to watch a movie, do something, even after midnight, to be used to this kind of late match,\xe2\x80\x9d said Goffin, who also insisted that she sleep in until noon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for the body and the mind to have this routine.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Still, Pavlyuchenkova said she felt sluggish. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was so, so strange because I was like \xe2\x80\x98Come on, I have to make rallies!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy energy level was on and off as well. I was trying to get as many energy drinks and gel packs as I could take.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After ingesting all that caffeine, how did Pavlyuchenkova plan to get to sleep? \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cTry to take chamomile tea?\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 A veteran right-hander with an all-court game and a one-handed backhand, the hands-down greatest player of his era, was trying to dodge an upset in a fourth-round match of a Grand Slam tournament against a former junior world No. 1 with long hair, a flowing one-handed backhand and no fear.'
b'In their first official head-to-head meeting, Pete Sampras, then 29, could not hold off a 19-year-old Roger Federer, who won in five sets at Wimbledon in 2001.'
b'On Sunday night at the Australian Open, Federer, the two-time defending champion, was the one looking across the net at a younger, fresher, more fearless version of himself. And like Sampras 18 years earlier, Federer had no answer for his fourth-round opponent, Stefanos Tsitsipas, a former junior world No. 1 from Greece who sent him packing with a 6-7 (11), 7-6 (3), 7-5, 7-6 (5) defeat in their first official head-to-head meeting.'
b'Federer was the 15th seed in 2001 when he beat Sampras, the top seed and a seven-time Wimbledon champion. Tsitsipas, 20, is the 14th seed and the youngest player remaining in the men\xe2\x80\x99s draw. With the victory, Tsitsipas foiled the 37-year-old Federer\xe2\x80\x99s bid to become the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals here since the 43-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1977.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI lost to a better player who was playing very well tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the third-seeded Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, including six titles in Australia. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hung in there, gave himself chances at some point, stayed calm. It\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy, especially for younger guys. Credit to him for taking care of that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The match lasted 3 hours 45 minutes, but Federer essentially cinched his fate two hours in, after he squandered eight break points, including three on unforced errors, to give Tsitsipas enough of an opening to squeeze past him in the second set.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t go the way I was hoping on the break points,\xe2\x80\x9d said Federer, who kept searching for a weakness to exploit only to see his strengths reflected back at him.'
b'Tsitsipas looked eminently comfortable at the net and he matched Federer winner for winner on the forehand side, with 15.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe did a nice job of taking care of his half volleys,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s maybe what won him the match tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Perhaps pride kept Federer from equivocating. The difference in the match was Tsitsipas\xe2\x80\x99s youthful energy, which he oozed with his every Tigger-like step. Federer simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match it from the first point to the last, a backhand that he netted.'
b'Federer wasted no time after the match completing his media responsibilities, leaving the clear impression that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put this loss in his rearview mirror fast enough. His eyes grew glassy as his news conference wore on, as if his feelings about the loss had traveled from his mouth to his marrow.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have massive regrets, you know, tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Federer, who also announced he intended to play some events on clay this spring after skipping clay-court season the past two years. \xe2\x80\x9cI might not look the part, but I am. I felt like I have to win the second set. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how I do it, but I have to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tsitsipas, who trains at the academy of Patrick Mouratoglou, whose best-known pupil is the 23-time major winner Serena Williams, was proud of the mental toughness he showed in fending off a dozen break points in all.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI could have cracked at any moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t because I really wanted it bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tsitsipas said he believed from the first point that he could pull off the upset and described the victory as \xe2\x80\x9ca beginning of something really big.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tsitsipas broke onto the scene last year by reaching the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto in August, defeating four top-10 players, including Novak Djokovic, on the way.'
b'Tsitsipas is in the quarterfinals of a major for the first time. He will face 22d-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut, 30, who will also be playing his first Grand Slam quarterfinal.'
b'John McEnroe, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, conducted the post-match, on-court interview with Tsitsipas and described his victory as a changing of the guard.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that story the last 10 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom that standpoint, nothing new.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He had a point. Consider Grigor Dimitrov, now 27, who made it to the quarterfinals here in 2014. He lost Sunday to Frances Tiafoe and is 0 for 34 in majors.'
b'Before Dimitrov, there was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, now 33, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the 2008 final here and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t advanced to another Grand Slam final.'
b'Even a player like Andy Murray, whose sterling career included major titles and wins over Federer, fell short of Federer\xe2\x80\x99s gold standard.'
b'So, yes, the torch has been passed, only to get extinguished. But there was a hint of resignation in Federer\xe2\x80\x99s voice and a slump in his shoulders during his news conference that belied the breeziness of his rebuttal to McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s observation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Stefanos, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely done a really nice job now the last year and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI see him definitely being high up in the game for a long time. This was a good night for him tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Sampras lost to Federer at Wimbledon, he won one more major, the 2002 United States Open, then retired. How many more chances will Federer get to grow his legacy?'
b'Federer looked irked when he was asked if he could see a bit of himself in Tsitsipas, the son of two tennis coaches, who has described Federer as his childhood idol.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a one-handed backhand and I used to have long hair, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Federer said. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, so maybe a little bit, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'On Friday, all 28 players on the United States women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, an escalation in their increasingly public battle for equality.'
b'The players have said that they play more games than the men\xe2\x80\x99s team \xe2\x80\x94 and win more of them \xe2\x80\x94 yet still receive less pay. They said \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d affected not only their paychecks, but also where they played and how often, how they trained, the medical care and coaching they received, and even how they traveled to matches.'
b'They are not alone in their fight for fairer pay and better treatment. Here are eight times in recent memory when women fought for equality in sports.'
b'Experts claimed for years that distance running was damaging to women\xe2\x80\x99s health and femininity.'
b'In 1967, women weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to officially enter the Boston Marathon, so Kathrine Switzer entered that year as \xe2\x80\x9cK.V. Switzer\xe2\x80\x9d to hide her gender.'
b'Two miles in, an official tried to eject her from the course, a moment captured in dramatic photographs. She finished anyway, becoming the first woman to complete the race as an official entrant.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe learned that women are not deficient in endurance and stamina, and that running requires no fancy facilities or equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d Switzer wrote in The New York Times in 2007.'
b'Women were officially allowed to enter the race in 1972. Women\xe2\x80\x99s marathoning joined the Olympics in 1984.'
b'The year 1973 was a big one for Billie Jean King, the trailblazing tennis star.'
b'She founded the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Tennis Association. She led a movement for female players to earn equal prize money in tournaments that featured players of both sexes.'
b'And, on a September night at the Astrodome in Houston, she epitomized her crusade for gender equality when she handily beat Bobby Riggs, a self-described male chauvinist pig, in the Battle of the Sexes.'
b'King went on to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 for her work championing the rights of women and gay people. She is considered to be one of the most important athletes of the 20th century.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs,\xe2\x80\x9d King once said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Chris Ernst is a two-time Olympic rower. But in the spring of 1976, she was the captain of Yale University\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s crew team \xe2\x80\x94 and sick of not having proper showers to use after practice.'
b'She led 18 teammates in an eye-catching protest at Yale\xe2\x80\x99s athletic office. The athletes stripped to their waists, revealing the words \xe2\x80\x9cTitle IX,\xe2\x80\x9d which had been drawn in blue marker on each woman\xe2\x80\x99s back and breasts.'
b'The Times ran an article in the next day\xe2\x80\x99s paper, and a photograph of the history-making event also ran in The Yale Daily News.'
b'Within two weeks, the female rowers had new locker rooms. And, across the country, educators began viewing Title IX \xe2\x80\x94 which had been in effect for just four years \xe2\x80\x94 as a law that required compliance.'
b'In 2007, after pressure from the tennis great Venus Williams and others, Wimbledon announced that women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis players would receive prize money equal to the men\xe2\x80\x99s.'
b'Williams had made a failed plea to Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s governing body the night before she won the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed essay in The Times of London titled \xe2\x80\x9cWimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I\xe2\x80\x99m Only a Second Class Champion.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever been let down by someone that you had long admired, respected and looked up to?\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle in life is more disappointing, particularly when that person does something that goes against the very heart of what you believe is right and fair.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After the policies changed in 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her fourth Wimbledon victory, the same amount as the men\xe2\x80\x99s champion, Roger Federer.'
b'In March 2017, the women\xe2\x80\x99s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey, the sport\xe2\x80\x99s national governing body, did not increase the women\xe2\x80\x99s wages.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that in 2017, we have to fight so hard just to get equitable support,\xe2\x80\x9d Meghan Duggan, the team\xe2\x80\x99s captain, said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to do the fair thing, and the right thing \xe2\x80\x94 not just for hockey but for all women.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'They put their careers on the line, but the risk paid off.'
b'Less than two weeks later, the team reached a four-year deal with U.S.A. Hockey. It provided the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. The team also received the same travel and insurance provisions that the men\xe2\x80\x99s national team did, and a pool of prize money to be split each year.'
b'Four prominent female big-wave surfers, Bianca Valenti, Andrea Moller, Keala Kennelly and Paige Alms, spent years fighting for equal pay in the largely male sport where they regularly risk their lives.'
b'Last July, the Committee for Equity in Women\xe2\x80\x99s Surfing, an organization formed by six women, sent letters to the California Coastal Commission arguing that by treating women unequally, the World Surf League was in violation of state civil rights law.'
b'Months later, in September, Valenti and other female surfers earned a victory when the World Surf League announced it would offer equal prize money to men and women.'
b'Valenti, along with Sabrina Brennan, the president of the San Mateo County Harbor Commission, and Karen Tynan, a labor lawyer, also successfully pushed for women to be included in the Maverick\xe2\x80\x99s Challenge, a big-wave surfing competition that had traditionally invited only men.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome people would tell me that by trying to get the (prize) pie redistributed I was ruining it for everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d Moller said in December. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I would just say: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. We\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for the industry. People love watching women surf big waves, so the whole sport will grow.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the world of professional basketball, pay disparities are well-documented: In the N.B.A., a multibillion-dollar industry where players often make millions, the minimum starting salary is about eight times what the average W.N.B.A. player makes.'
b'And female players are speaking up, on social media and on TV.'
b'Skylar Diggins-Smith, the W.N.B.A. All-Star who plays guard for the Dallas Wings, recently appeared in a commercial to raise awareness about pay inequity.'
b'The commercial, by the investment adviser Wealthsimple, contrasts the paths of two young players, a boy and a girl. Each lists their basketball dreams and accomplishments, but only one will grow up to receive a multimillion-dollar rookie contract.'
b'A\xe2\x80\x99ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the first overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, has also weighed in: \xe2\x80\x9cmust. be. nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote about LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe over here looking for a M but Lord, let me get back in my lane.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, was expected to earn about $6.8 million in his first year playing for the Phoenix Suns.'
b"Ada Hegerberg, a 23-year-old Norwegian, was recognized as the best female soccer player in the world last year when she became the first person to win the women\xe2\x80\x99s Ballon d'Or, a prestigious individual honor in soccer that had previously been reserved for men."
b'Despite the big award, she has decided not to play on the biggest stage of all, the Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, in France this summer.'
b'Hegerberg quit the Norwegian national team in 2017 in protest of what she said was a lack of support for women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer in her home country.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was quite clear with them about what I thought needed to be better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in an interview after winning the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave them the reasons. I wish my national team all the best. I love my country. I wish I could play for them. In this case, I had to move on.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Tiger Woods hadn\xe2\x80\x99t won a major in 11 years. He had struggled through injury and personal crises. He was dismissed as finished, his years of dominance fading into memory.'
b'Then on Sunday he won the Masters again, at age 43.'
b'When athletes begin to fade, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually all over. But a select few have returned in triumph, defying setbacks or Father Time.'
b'The comeback most people thought of when Woods won Sunday was the Masters victory by Jack Nicklaus at age 46 in 1986. Nicklaus had not won a major in six years and became the oldest player to win the Masters.'
b'Even more incredible was the return of Ben Hogan at the 1950 U.S. Open. His car had collided head-on with a Greyhound bus in Texas in 1949, and Hogan was nearly killed. After two months in the hospital, and a year recovering, he returned to golf and won the Open. He added five more major championships over the next three years.'
b'After three straight championships with the Chicago Bulls from 1991 to \xe2\x80\x9993, Michael Jordan decided to give baseball a try. A .200 batting average in the minor leagues made him a figure of ridicule for many fans and commentators, and the N.B.A. moved on.'
b'Then as abruptly as he retired, Jordan came back in 1995. In his first three full seasons, the Bulls won three more titles. Jordan retired again in 1999, generally considered the best player in basketball history. (A second comeback, with the Washington Wizards, was less successful.)'
b'After Muhammad Ali declined to serve in the military during the Vietnam War, he was stripped of his heavyweight title and was unable to box for three years.'
b'When he was able to get relicensed in 1970, he resumed a career that is regularly cited as the greatest. He regained his title in 1974 and battled through three immortal fights against Joe Frazier.'
b'George Foreman, from whom Ali recaptured the heavyweight title in 1974, hung up the gloves in 1977. But 10 years later, at 38, he decided to return to the ring. After a series of wins, he got a shot at the title at age 42, but lost to Evander Holyfield. He kept boxing, though, and got another improbable title shot in 1994 at 45 years old. Incredibly, he beat the champion, Michael Moorer, and won three more fights before losing in his final bout in 1997 at age 48.'
b'Roger Federer\xe2\x80\x99s win at the Australian Open in 2017, at age 35, was his first major title in five years and capped a comeback from back injuries and knee surgery. Beating Rafael Nadal in that final showed Federer could defeat the younger rivals who had flummoxed him during his drought. In 2018, he won the Australian Open again, for his 20th major title, and returned to No. 1.'
b'Jennifer Capriati was written off after her career as a teen star was derailed by personal problems. She quit the tour for two years and dropped out of the rankings. But she returned in 1996 a more mature player and won the Australian Open in 2001 at 24. She became world No. 1 and added two more Grand Slam titles.'
b'But the most inspiring tennis comeback undoubtedly belonged to Monica Seles, who was stabbed by a deranged fan on the court in 1993. She was 19, No. 1 and an eight-time major singles champion at the time. Seles struggled with her injuries and with understandable anxiety after the attack. Still, she returned to win the 1996 Australian Open and make three other Grand Slam finals.'
b'Quarterback Doug Williams helped lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the 1979 N.F.C. championship game. But after a salary dispute in 1982, he left to join the fledgling U.S.F.L.'
b'When that league folded, Williams caught on as a backup to Jay Schroeder for the Washington Redskins in 1987. But Williams earned the starting job just before the playoffs and led the team to a Super Bowl title, the first black quarterback ever to do so.'
b'Aldiniti was a solid steeplechaser in Britain in the late 1970s before sustaining a bad leg injury. At about the same time, the jockey Bob Champion learned he had testicular cancer. Once both had recovered, they were paired for the 1981 Grand National and won it. Their triumph was turned into a 1984 movie, \xe2\x80\x9cChampions,\xe2\x80\x9d starring John Hurt.'
b'Honorable mention goes to Da Hoss. He won the 1996 Breeders\xe2\x80\x99 Cup Mile, then raced only once in two years. Yet in his return to the Mile in 1998, he won it again, causing the race announcer Tom Durkin to proclaim it \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest comeback since Lazarus.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Greg LeMond became the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986 and seemed poised to reel off several more. But the next year he was accidentally shot while turkey hunting, hit by several dozen pellets, including some in his heart lining.'
b'He returned to the Tour in 1989 in poor form and was considering retirement. But he strengthened as the race went along and won it in one of the most famous finishes ever, beating his rival Laurent Fignon in a time trial on the Champs-\xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es. The final margin was the closest in history: eight seconds. LeMond went on to win another Tour the next year.'
b'Tommy John had a strong 12-year career as a pitcher for the Indians, White Sox and Dodgers. But in 1974 he sustained an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow, which usually meant the end of pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 careers.'
