b'U.S.A. Basketball plans to gauge the interest of the Duke University sensation Zion Williamson in joining the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 12-man squad for the FIBA World Cup in China this summer, according to a person familiar with U.S.A. Basketball\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.'
b'No discussions have taken place with Williamson, whose freshman season at Duke ended Sunday with a 68-67 quarterfinal loss against Michigan State in the N.C.A.A. tournament.'
b'Formal talks with Williams, the presumptive No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick, would most likely not take place until Williams had officially declared his intention to turn professional and chosen an agent licensed by the N.B.A. to represent him, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly.'
b'But the precedent for such an invitation was set by the current U.S.A. Basketball hierarchy in 2012, when Anthony Davis \xe2\x80\x94 fresh off being drafted No. 1 overall out of Kentucky by the New Orleans Pelicans \xe2\x80\x94 earned a roster spot with Team USA at the London Olympics under Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski.'
b'The 2019 World Cup, which runs Aug. 31 to Sept. 15 in China, will be the first major competition for the United States since Krzyzewski was succeeded as coach by Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. Williamson is widely regarded as the rare sort of talent, like Davis before him, who would not be out of place with the N.B.A. All-Stars expected to fill out Popovich\xe2\x80\x99s roster \xe2\x80\x94 no matter who is coaching.'
b'The Athletic reported Monday that the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 LeBron James, a three-time Olympian, would not make himself available for the World Cup team this summer but that he had not ruled out playing for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.'
b'There was some hope in international basketball circles that James would consider playing in the World Cup since the Lakers had missed the playoffs and James would sit out the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since 2004-05.'
b'Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of U.S.A. Basketball, declined to discuss James or Williamson specifically when he was reached on Monday, saying only that roster invitations \xe2\x80\x9cwill be addressed at the appropriate time.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The real hoops drama is in Europe.'
b'By Zach Messitte'
b'Mr. Messitte is writing a book about Americans playing basketball in Italy.'
b'MILAN \xe2\x80\x94 As the National Basketball Association plods its way to the 68th annual All-Star Game in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday, American hoops fans should take note of how the Italians generate hardwood drama in February.'
b'Since Thursday, the eight best teams in Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Lega Basket Serie A from the first half of the season have been competing for the Coppa Italia, a no-holds-barred, single elimination tournament whose outcome actually matters to fans, players, team owners and corporate sponsors. And while a champion will be crowned at the end of the playoffs later this spring, bragging rights for holding the Coppa\xe2\x80\x99s trophy aloft on Sunday provides a midseason shot of adrenaline.'
b'The N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s 82-game regular season, which began in October and will end in April, is a slog. Anyone who has watched a Wednesday night non-marquee matchup in November can attest to that. The action rarely begins before the fourth quarter; coaches rest their superstars.'
b'The first half of the Italian season, by contrast, is an exciting sprint from the opening tipoff. The 16-team league has a 30-game regular season in which each club plays each other twice \xe2\x80\x94 once at each other\xe2\x80\x99s home court. If you play in Venice in week one, Venice\xe2\x80\x99s team comes to your arena in week 16. And there\xe2\x80\x99s drama: Turin, seeded fifth in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Coppa, won the trophy, even though they placed 11th at the end of the season.'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s an intensity to the Italian regular season that too often is missing from the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s long fall and winter games. Not only are there fewer games, but also they are shorter and quicker (10- as opposed to 12-minute quarters and with fewer play stoppages mandated by television). And even if the quality of play in Italy is inferior, the interest in the February Coppa Italia far outstrips whether Team LeBron will prevail over Team Giannis at the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star Game.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhether it is game six or 26, you are always playing for something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Travis Diener, an American who also holds Italian citizenship and plays on this year\xe2\x80\x99s fourth-seeded team from Cremona. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you get the Coppa and anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x9d Diener, who spent several years in the N.B.A., won the M.V.P. award of the Coppa Italia when he was playing for Sassari in Sardinia in 2014.'
b'The Coppa allows teams from smaller markets (and smaller budgets) like Sassari and Cremona (more famous for Stradivarius violins than hoops) to pull off March Madness-like upsets against more glamorous squads like Milan, which is sponsored by Giorgio Armani and takes full advantage of the lack of a league salary cap.'
b'In last year\xe2\x80\x99s Coppa, Milan was one of three top seeds that lost in the first round, much to the delight of fans from smaller-market teams like Cant\xc3\xb9, which plays in the Milanese suburb of Desio. As one team official told me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that coaches have built-in salary incentives if their team does well at the midseason tournament \xe2\x80\x94 and sponsors, of course, love the positive brand attention of a winning squad.'
b'The quarterfinal round began on Thursday and Friday, featuring a doubleheader each day: Milan-Bologna and Cremona-Varese on day one, and Venice-Sassari and Avellino-Brindisi on day two. American fans should try to imagine a similar midseason weekend tournament: What if the Bucks, Warriors, Raptors, Nuggets, Celtics, Pacers, Thunder and 76ers were playing in Charlotte this weekend for bragging rights to an American Basketball Cup? It would be a fresh take on a tired All-Star Game whose television ratings have declined by more than 50 percent since the Michael Jordan-dominated 1990s.'
b'The Italian basketball league used to have its own all-star game, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough sustained interest from players or fans, so it ended in 2016. A dunk contest was similarly discontinued. Giorgio Gandolfi, a former basketball journalist who now runs his own international sports agency and who has been to 13 N.B.A. All-Star Games, said that winning the Coppa Italia is second in prestige only to winning the league championship at the end of the season. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss Italy\xe2\x80\x99s all-star games. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were just kind of boring,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'While there is too much money to be made for the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 and team owners \xe2\x80\x94 to consider shortening the season from the grueling 82-game march to the playoffs, the idea of borrowing from the Italians to make each tipoff count more should be enticing.'
b'Take the case of the New York Knicks, who currently hold the worst record in the N.B.A. There is nothing much left for the Knicks to play for or their fans to watch this season.'
b'By contrast, Italian basketball teams near the bottom of the league run the risk of relegation to the second division, which is a bad result for everyone. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the fight near the end of the season can be just as fierce at the bottom as it is as the top.'
b'If the Knicks had to worry about being consigned to the minor leagues, the folks at Madison Square Garden might think differently about how to handle the final months of the season. If the Knicks were demoted to play against the Maine Red Claws, New York fans would probably have some choice words and creative hand gestures for their team\xe2\x80\x99s poor management. Italian basketball fans would have some advice on how to do that better, too.'

b'Although noting "regrets" that LSU men\'s basketball coach Will Wade didn\'t comply with the school several weeks ago when asked about recruiting issues, athletic director Joe Alleva announced in a statement Sunday that Wade\'s month-plus suspension has been lifted.'
b"The university suspended Wade on March 8 because it said he refused to meet with school officials amid scrutiny of a reported FBI wiretap capturing the coach talking about an offer to then-recruit Javonte Smart. Wade missed the Tigers' final regular-season game and all of their SEC and NCAA Tournament games."
b'Assistant coach Tony Benford took over as head coach and led LSU to the SEC regular-season title with a win over Vanderbilt in his first game, then led the Tigers to the Sweet 16, where they lost to Michigan State.'
b'Wade was reinstated after he met with Alleva and NCAA compliance officials on Friday, Alleva said in the statement, adding that he saw no place where Wade violated his contract, allowing for his reinstatement.'
b'"During those meetings, he answered all questions and denied any wrongdoing in connection with recently reported allegations of irregularities in college basketball recruiting," Alleva said.'
b'The statement also said the university "regrets that Coach Wade did not choose to fulfill his obligations to LSU when he was first asked to do so. However, the seriousness of the allegations and Coach Wade\'s prior refusal to refute them could not be ignored without exposing the University and basketball program to great risk. Protecting LSU and preserving our integrity must always be our first priority. Coach Wade\'s explanations and clarifications offered during the meeting, absent actual evidence of misconduct, satisfy his contractual obligation to LSU."'
b"The alleged offer to Smart arose in a conversation Wade was having with Christian Dawkins, described as a middleman in the scandal of paying basketball recruits. Dawkins was convicted on felony charges of wire fraud last year and sentenced last month to six months in prison. The specifics of that case were unrelated to Dawkins' reported interaction with Wade."
b'ESPN and Yahoo Sports reported last month that a wiretap caught Wade upset about not landing Smart at that point despite a "strong-ass offer." CBS Sports described Smart as a top-50 recruit from Baton Rouge. He ultimately signed with the Tigers.'
b'"I was thinking last night on this Smart thing," Wade reportedly said to Dawkins on the wiretap. "I\'ll be honest with you, I\'m (expletive) tired of dealing with the thing. Like I\'m just (expletive) sick of dealing with the (expletive). Like, this should not be that (expletive) complicated."'

b'As the crowd filed out of the Barclays Center in May 2015, there was reason for hope. Though the Nets had just been eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs, they had overachieved and shown some promise for the future. And Phil Jackson had become the Knicks president the year before, bringing his triangle offense and a coaching r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 that included 11 N.B.A. titles to Manhattan.'
b'Little did New York fans know that it would be four dreadful years before playoff basketball would return to the city. It finally will on Thursday night, when the Nets host the Philadelphia 76ers in a series tied at one all.'
b'While there has been no playoff basketball in the city in the interim, much has happened in those four years. And for Knicks and Nets fans, not much of it has been good.'
b'May 1, 2015 The eighth-seeded Nets fall to the top-seeded Hawks, 111-87. But they take two games in the series, raising optimism. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to secure a playoff spot,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Lionel Hollins says. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people will say, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s their problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'June 25 After putting up a 17-65 record, the worst in franchise history and the league\xe2\x80\x99s second worst in 2015, the Knicks have bad luck in the draft lottery, ending up at the No. 4 spot. Nevertheless, their selection, Kristaps Porzingis of Latvia, will pay off, quickly becoming a star and a fan favorite.'
b'Oct. 3 Knicks Coach Derek Fisher gets into a physical altercation after being confronted by Matt Barnes of the Memphis Grizzlies at the home of Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s estranged wife. Barnes is suspended for two games.'
b'Dec. 30 Cleanthony Early of the Knicks is shot in the knee by masked men and robbed of gold teeth caps after a visit to a strip club.'
b'Jan. 10, 2016 The Nets fire Coach Hollins and demote General Manager Billy King with the team at 10-27. \xe2\x80\x9cFrankly speaking, I deserve a championship now much more than six years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d  owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov says.'
b'Feb. 8 The Knicks, 23-31, fire Fisher. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot to say,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson says in his first remarks to reporters since the start of training camp.'
b'April 13 The Nets finish the season 21-61, the league\xe2\x80\x99s third worst record. But there will be little help on draft day: They traded their top pick to the Celtics in 2014 for a 37-year-old Kevin Garnett and a 36-year-old Paul Pierce, both of whom are gone at this point.'
b'The Knicks finish 32-50. That\xe2\x80\x99s a 15-game improvement, but Jackson says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed about our season.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'April 17 The Nets hire Kenny Atkinson, a Hawks assistant, as head coach. \xe2\x80\x9cTogether, we can do great things,\xe2\x80\x9d Prokhorov says.'
b'June 2 The Knicks hire Jeff Hornacek as coach, bypassing the interim coach, Kurt Rambis.'
b'June 22 The Knicks trade for Derrick Rose, who proclaims them a \xe2\x80\x9csuperteam.\xe2\x80\x9d After a year he will leave for the Cleveland Cavaliers.'
b'July 7 The Nets sign Jeremy Lin, perhaps hoping to recapture the Linsanity that took over the Knicks in 2012.'
b'July 8 The Knicks sign Joakim Noah for four years and $72 million. This will not work out. Noah will be suspended for 20 games for a drug violation, be sent to the developmental league and get into a shouting match with Hornacek. The Knicks wind up releasing him in 2018 and paying him anyway.'
b'Feb. 8, 2017 The Knicks legend Charles Oakley is ejected from Madison Square Garden during a game. The crowd sides with the former player, chanting \xe2\x80\x9cOakley, Oakley.\xe2\x80\x9d The Knicks say he behaved abusively, and the owner, James L. Dolan, says that Oakley \xe2\x80\x9cmay have a problem with alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d Oakley sues, claiming defamation and battery.'
b'March 12 Carmelo Anthony gets his 10,000th point as a Knick, becoming the third player to reach that mark with two teams.'
b'April 12 The Nets finish 20-62, the worst record in the league. Once again a potentially high draft pick is gone, as part of the Garnett deal. The Knicks are 31-51.'
b'June 22 The Nets trade their longtime star Brook Lopez to the Los Angeles Lakers for D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov. Russell will become a key player in the team\xe2\x80\x99s resurgence.'
b'June 28 The Knicks and Phil Jackson agree to part ways after three years. The Knicks never fully embraced his triangle offense, and Jackson remained wary of the 3-point shot as it became increasingly important in the league. He also could never seem to get rid of Anthony, the team\xe2\x80\x99s aging star who refused to waive a no-trade clause. Jackson also feuded with the player expected to be the team\xe2\x80\x99s future, Porzingis.'
b'Sept. 25 A trade is finally worked out for Anthony, who is sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Enes Kanter. He gave the Knicks seven seasons of 20-points-a-game play. Jackson was willing \xe2\x80\x9cto trade me for a bag of chips,\xe2\x80\x9d Anthony says. He also notes that under new management, \xe2\x80\x9cThey went from asking for peanuts to asking for steak.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Oct. 18 Lin ruptures a knee tendon  in the Nets\xe2\x80\x99 opening game and misses the entire season.'
b'Feb. 6, 2018 Porzingis tears the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and is out for the rest of this season and the next one.'
b'April 11 The Nets finish 28-54. Incredibly, for a third straight year they do not have their top pick because of that Garnett deal. (Garnett is by now 41 and has been out of the league two years.) The lost picks turned into Jaylen Brown, a big part of the contending Celtics; Markelle Fultz, a No. 1 overall choice; and Collin Sexton, who averaged 17 points as a rookie with the Cleveland Cavaliers.'
b'The Knicks wind up 29-53 and fire Hornacek the next day. David Fizdale will be the new coach.'
b'Asked how the Knicks can improve, the superfan Spike Lee can only turn to prayer: \xe2\x80\x9cOn bended knee I pray above to da basketball gods to deliver us back to da glory years of da Orange and Blue. Amen,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes in The New York Times.'
b'June 20 The Nets make a trade to get Dwight Howard from the Hornets, but Howard buys his way out of his contract and never plays for them.'
b'July 13 The Nets trade Lin to the Hawks, curing the city\xe2\x80\x99s second, significantly milder case of Linsanity.'
b'Jan. 31, 2019 The Knicks  send their most popular player, Porzingis, who is still recovering from the torn A.C.L., to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster trade. Two months later it will be revealed that he is under investigation by the New York Police Department after being accused of sexual assault.'
b'The Knicks get Dennis Smith Jr. and some expiring contracts, which should open up salary cap space so they can sign some marquee free agents. Assuming that marquee free agents would want to play for the Knicks.'
b'March 12 Knicks fans hoping for a change in ownership are disappointed when Dolan proclaims that he will not sell the team, even for $6 billion. Two days before that, he was filmed threatening a fan with banishment from the Garden after the fan had urged him to sell the team.'
b'April 10 The Knicks have sunk to the bottom of the league again, finishing 17-65 and tying the franchise-worst mark. The Nets start the season 8-18, but then unexpectedly turn things around behind Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie (picked up from the developmental league in 2016) and Jarrett Allen (a No. 22 pick in 2017). They finish 42-40. Playoff basketball returns to New York. For now.'

b'OAKLAND, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 The Golden State Warriors run a practice drill that Coach Steve Kerr did not intend as a tribute, even if he named it after someone who taught him a great deal. He calls it the \xe2\x80\x9cLute Olson drill,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is a blur of activity: a 3-on-2 exercise that Kerr uses to get his players up and down the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to get a little running and rhythm and shooting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The Warriors, who are pretty good at those things, have elevated basketball into modern art in recent seasons. But Kerr, as he helps define basketball\xe2\x80\x99s present, cannot help but dip into his past. He learned that drill in 1983, when he was a freshman guard at the University of Arizona playing for Olson, who was in the early stages of building a college powerhouse. Kerr, ever the student, was already absorbing as much as he could.'
b'Olson, 84, retired as the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at Arizona in 2008, but his influence resonates. Not so much, oddly enough, at the college level, where, of late, Arizona has had its well-publicized struggles along with the rest of the Pac-12 Conference. Instead, Olson\xe2\x80\x99s impact exists largely in the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 and with the Warriors, in particular.'
b'Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr\xe2\x80\x99s longtime assistants, played for Olson in the 1980s before working under him as a graduate assistant. And Andre Iguodala, the veteran Warriors forward, played at Arizona from 2002 to 2004, when he sought to emulate an older teammate named Luke Walton.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll the fundamentals,\xe2\x80\x9d Iguodala said. \xe2\x80\x9cThings like footwork, body positioning and just being a smart player.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Walton, who now has the thankless task of coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, is still considered a member of the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 extended family after serving as one of Kerr\xe2\x80\x99s assistants for two seasons. Before Walton joined the Warriors in 2014, Kerr did not know him well. But Olson recommended him, and that was more than enough.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you came out of Arizona during that era, you knew how to play the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Fraser said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was mostly because of Lute.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Olson, who has had health issues in recent years, emphasized basketball basics. Each practice began with a series of chest passes. Players worked on their weak hands. The Warriors, who warm up by launching half-court heaves, are slightly less regimented.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Coach Olson walked in and saw some of this, he\xe2\x80\x99d be shaking his head,\xe2\x80\x9d Fraser said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d think we\xe2\x80\x99re so loose.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Warriors are still mindful of the essentials, though, especially at training camp, where they dribble around traffic cones and throw passes at pitch-back nets configured with targets. If they channel the Harlem Globetrotters, their flamboyance is rooted in bedrock principles.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think you could tie a lot of that back to Coach Olson and Arizona,\xe2\x80\x9d Fraser said.'
b'Kerr played for several legendary N.B.A. coaches \xe2\x80\x94 Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Lenny Wilkens, Cotton Fitzsimmons \xe2\x80\x94 and he took pieces from each as he developed his own style. Jerry Marvin, his former coach at Palisades High School in Los Angeles, made a big impression, too. But these were coaches with unique approaches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the common thread is their force of personality,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey all saw the game a little differently and ran different stuff, basing a lot of it on their personnel. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not what made them great coaches. It was having great talent, and then developing a great culture and system so that their talent could flourish.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Olson, for example, adapted to the strengths of his roster. He became more guard-oriented over the years, especially after he recruited high-profile players like Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves and Gilbert Arenas. (Kerr noted how he had been one of the \xe2\x80\x9cslow guys in the backcourt\xe2\x80\x9d when Olson was just starting out at Arizona.)'
b'But Olson was not necessarily trying to outwit anyone by being especially innovative. Basketball, Kerr said, is not like football, where a mastermind like Bill Belichick can lean on his tactical genius to mold the New England Patriots into the most dominant N.F.L. team of his era.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFootball is so strategic,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in basketball, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many guys I can think of historically who are the best coaches on earth who were just offensive wizards or defensive wizards. It was more about the culture they built and the way their teams played together \xe2\x80\x94 not a style or a system.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It has become a hackneyed concept in sports, as if teams can just crack the code on demand, but Olson was all about culture, his former players say. Jason Terry, a retired N.B.A. guard who played at Arizona from 1995 to 1999, recalled his recruitment. He was not a shy young man, but Olson, at that point firmly established as one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s top coaches, had the sort of gravitas that intimidated him.'
b'On the second day of Terry\xe2\x80\x99s official visit to Arizona, Olson and his wife, Bobbi, had him over for pancakes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese unbelievable pancakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry, an analyst for Turner Sports, said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a big part of the recruitment. But I also remember that he kind of came over and put his big paw on my shoulder, and I jumped. He was like, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing to be scared of young fella. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to have you in my home.\xe2\x80\x99 And from that point on, you were just at ease.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Olson, Terry said, was the first coach he had who never used profanity. Olson would glare. His face would go red. And those big paws would shake.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut he would never yell,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would just say your name over and over and over.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Above all, Olson imbued his players with the sense that they were a part of something larger than themselves. Before the national championship game in 1997, two prominent alumni \xe2\x80\x94 Kerr and Sean Elliott, both of whom had graduated to the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 boarded the team bus. Olson had invited them to address his players, and their message was simple: Do it for all of us who have come before you but could never quite get the job done.'
b'Terry saw that Olson had tears in his eyes. Arizona went on to win its first national title by defeating Kentucky in overtime.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe knew that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him down,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said.'
b'With the Warriors, Kerr definitely swears on occasion. (Ask Draymond Green.) And the N.B.A. is not college basketball. But Kerr still tries to foster an atmosphere that is more about the collective whole than about its supremely talented parts. Kerr loathes isolation sets. He celebrates ball movement. And he stages team dinners on road trips, where family members are welcome.'
b'As for the Pac-12, these are rough days. Arizona, under Coach Sean Miller, has been entwined in a corruption scandal, and the conference could send just one team to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Iguodala described the Pac-12 as garbage (he used a more colorful word), though he expressed hope moving forward. Kerr was more diplomatic.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a dry spell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In fact, the Pac-12 has not won a national championship since Kerr boarded the Arizona team bus back in 1997 and delivered his pregame pep talk. But in his own way, as the Warriors chase another title, he is still carrying the mantle for the conference and his old coach.'

b'It is one of the oldest warnings in sports: Great athletes, they say, don\xe2\x80\x99t often become great coaches.'
b'In the case of Magic Johnson, the legendary former Los Angeles Lakers point guard, that maxim must be amended. For Johnson, neither the front office nor the bench proved to be a winning or even comfortable habitat like the hardwood he used as a launching pad to basketball immortality.'
b'Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s forgettable coaching career with the Lakers lasted just 16 games at the close of the 1993-94 season before he unhappily vowed never to return to that occupation. Then this week, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s two-year reign as the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 president of basketball operations ended even more ignominiously.'
b'He abruptly announced his resignation before the team\xe2\x80\x99s final game of an enormously disappointing season, then revealed that he had told the news media of the decision before he had informed his boss, Jeanie Buss, in order to deny Buss an opportunity to talk him out of it.'
b'Johnson, of course, has stunned the world before, with his announcement and early retirement in 1991 because he was found to be H.I.V. positive, followed by his brief return to basketball in 1996. He spent the ensuing two decades constructing a business and entertainment empire replete with a highly successful chain of movie theaters and an ownership stake in the storied Los Angeles Dodgers. But Johnson always insisted that he was, first and foremost, a Laker.'
b'Handling his exit in such a haphazard manner has earned Johnson untold amounts of criticism in the days since, given how much the Lakers mean to Southern Californians and how unexpected this news was. Yet he seems prepared to take the hits in exchange for the opportunity to return to his more customary post-playing life \xe2\x80\x9con the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d as he described it \xe2\x80\x94 forever a Laker but officially unattached to any team.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI like to be free,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said.'
b'But his freedom comes at a steep cost \xe2\x80\x94 to Johnson, to the Lakers, to a Hollywood belief in, well, magic.'
b'It turns out Magic Johnson, who piloted some of the greatest teams in N.B.A. history, will not be the savior who helps the Lakers escape their longest run of futility.'
b'After last summer\xe2\x80\x99s blockbuster signing of LeBron James, Johnson proclaimed the Lakers to be \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 with the promise of a return to full \xe2\x80\x9cback back\xe2\x80\x9d status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to James. Johnson has instead fled just when the most crucial work was about to commence, with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoffs in 2013 and last won a championship in 2010.'
b'When he convened an impromptu news conference Tuesday night, rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the Lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base, Johnson did just the opposite. Describing himself as \xe2\x80\x9chappier when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the president,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained that the conditions and pressures attached to building a championship team around James meant that the real Magic \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In a series of rambling interviews with a number of news outlets while the Lakers were in the process of losing their regular-season finale to the Portland Trail Blazers, Johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to Oklahoma City\xe2\x80\x99s Russell Westbrook or to tutor Ben Simmons, the rising Philadelphia 76ers star, without inciting a storm of tampering allegations.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew if I stayed in the role,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m giving up a lot of me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Such disclosures, of course, only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted Buss\xe2\x80\x99s decision to install Johnson as the new face of the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 basketball operations in February 2017.'
b'Rival front-office executives questioned Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the all-encompassing nature of the job from the moment he was named to replace the much-maligned Jim Buss (Jeanie\xe2\x80\x99s brother) and Mitch Kupchak, the longtime Lakers executive. Those questions only rose in volume when Buss named as Magic\xe2\x80\x99s sidekick another front-office neophyte, Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s polarizing former agent.'
b'There were red flags from the start. In taking on his first active role with an N.B.A. team since his second retirement as a player in 1996, Johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the ins and outs of the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s complex salary cap and the rhythms of a job that had evolved so much in his time away.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe main part for me is really learning the other part that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and that is to understand the C.B.A., the salary cap, where we are in terms of the salary cap and who\xe2\x80\x99s a free-agent-to-be,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson told USA Today of the challenges he faced in building a roster and understanding the collective bargaining agreement.'
b'Part of the issue might have been that Johnson could never just be a basketball executive. He is a mogul and a cultural force. While other N.B.A. teams primarily lean on decision makers focusing solely on basketball, Johnson seemed to always have his eye on something bigger than the game itself \xe2\x80\x94 reaching with his business tentacles to as many corners as possible.'
b'Johnson acquired a 4.5 percent share of the Lakers in 1994 before selling his stake in 2010. He even once hosted a syndicated late-night talk show, 1998\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Magic Hour.\xe2\x80\x9d And he was never just about one game either, acquiring a minority stake in the Dodgers in 2012 and one in the Los Angeles Football Club of Major League Soccer in 2014.'
b'Business had clearly been on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s mind when he took the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 front-office job in 2017. He told \xe2\x80\x9cCBS This Morning\xe2\x80\x9d in an interview at the time that he had turned down other offers to run a franchise, including the embattled Knicks, but that he felt it was the right time to rejoin the Lakers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt this point in my life, you know, I think that I can do it right now because my businesses are running smooth,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can turn them over to my executive team that I have.\xe2\x80\x9d In that same interview, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI always wanted to be the male Oprah.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Johnson was one of the first athletes to build an empire for himself outside professional sports. He went from whipping behind-the-back passes and being the engine that made the 1980s Showtime Lakers rev to investing in more than 100 Starbucks and Burger King locations, among many other business investments, all while flashing his famed charismatic grin. According to a Basketball Reference estimate, Johnson made about $23 million from N.B.A. salary alone, not including endorsements. Now his net worth is in the hundreds of millions.'
b'The business of reviving the Lakers, however, proved beyond him. Buss, as a result, is already facing pressure to rebound from her nostalgic faith in Johnson to pursue a more accomplished executive this time \xe2\x80\x94 such as Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s Bob Myers or San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s R. C. Buford \xe2\x80\x94 to plot the team\xe2\x80\x99s recovery from a season soaked in drama and dysfunction.'
b'Bizarre as the timing seemed, Johnson insisted to reporters that there were no hidden reasons for leaving other than the desire, as he put it to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s Rachel Nichols, to stop \xe2\x80\x9cletting myself down by not being Magic Johnson.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that walking away when he did spared him from firing Coach Luke Walton \xe2\x80\x94 something Walton and his assistant coaches, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discuss it publicly, had been bracing for this week. Walton\xe2\x80\x99s culpability for the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 37-45 record is a matter of debate, given all of this season\xe2\x80\x99s injuries, but Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s desire to make a change had been widely anticipated in league circles for weeks, if not months. Buss\xe2\x80\x99s well-chronicled fondness for Walton is thought to be the only thing that had kept him in place throughout Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s reign.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would have to affect someone\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood and their life,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson told reporters Tuesday night, seemingly confirming that he was poised to fire Walton. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thought about that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fun for me. That\xe2\x80\x99s not who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There had never been a player like Johnson before he was drafted out of Michigan State as the first pick in the 1979 N.B.A. draft. His court vision, quickness, length and versatility made him a dominant presence and led to his winning three Most Valuable Player Awards and five N.B.A. championships. He became perhaps the defining face of what it means to be a Laker \xe2\x80\x94 no easy feat given the deep well of great players who have worn their familiar purple-and-gold jersey.'
b'But the fact that Buss has yet to address the news media, beyond a brief statement insisting that the organization still believed \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d speaks to the team\xe2\x80\x99s level of shock that he would step down without warning.'
b'At a speaking engagement at Chapman University on April 3, Buss acknowledged that the Lakers \xe2\x80\x9chaven\xe2\x80\x99t lived up to the brand my father created,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to one of the most successful owners in the history of American team sports: Jerry Buss. The signing of James in free agency last summer \xe2\x80\x94 for which Johnson is sometimes subjected to claims that his \xe2\x80\x9ccloser\xe2\x80\x9d role was overstated \xe2\x80\x94 could not prevent the Lakers from extending their playoff drought to a franchise-worst sixth consecutive season. That figure matches the Knicks for the league\xe2\x80\x99s third-longest active drought behind Sacramento (13 seasons) and Phoenix (nine).'
b'Now, the onus falls squarely on Buss to find a successor to repair a roster in need of overhaul.'
b'To Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s relief, such issues are no longer his concern. He returns now to a world he may have felt increasingly more comfortable with anyway in recent years: the one outside basketball. As he told The Los Angeles Times in 2008, Johnson hoped to go down in history as a better businessman than an athlete.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m going after it each and every day.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 The criminal case involving one of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s leading adversaries and the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest shoe company has also ensnared an unlikely figure from the youth basketball world.'
b'The coach, Gary Franklin Sr., started his club from scratch in Los Angeles and ran a program known for its rectitude, according to Sonny Vaccaro, the former Nike and Adidas executive who essentially forged the relationship between the shoe industry and the summer youth basketball circuit. What began as a team for Franklin to coach his then 10-year-old son became a powerhouse club that attracted future N.B.A. stars and major college recruits, and one that steered clear of any scandals.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of the guys who built it up through his own resources, and his program had a reputation as one of the \xe2\x80\x98good guys,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Vaccaro said of Franklin in an interview this week.'
b'Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s club, California Supreme, and others like it are major participants in a system involving youth basketball, shoe companies and colleges that supplies the professional game with a deep reservoir of talent. And Michael Avenatti knew it.'
b'Now Franklin has become a central figure in the case against Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her lawsuit against President Trump. Whether Franklin, who has not been charged, is an accomplice, a co-conspirator or simply collateral damage is not yet clear, but prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 revelations about his involvement have stunned those who have known him for years.'
b'The question in the club basketball world is, could Franklin have morphed from a stickler who played by the rules into the latest symbol of an amateur basketball world that has spun out of control?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCal Supreme was always the best team for doing things by the book, because there were a lot of other teams that didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it by the book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy Brown, a former forward for Cal Supreme who went on to play at Stanford. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cal Supreme did it by the book.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'California Supreme reached its zenith at the 2016 Peach Jam, a summertime showcase for the best travel basketball teams and players in the country. In the final event of the Nike-sponsored league, Deandre Ayton, a towering Bahamian who was about to turn 18, helped the team reel off a huge winning streak before Cal Supreme fell to the eventual champions.'
b'For Franklin, a soft-spoken coach from Los Angeles, the run was a triumph. His Nike-sponsored team was one of the best in the country in what is now known as grass-roots basketball.'
b'Three years later, Franklin, 51, is in a different spotlight, with federal prosecutors accusing Avenatti of extortion for threatening Nike with the release of information that Avenatti had pledged would damage the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock-market value to the tune of a few billion dollars. Specifically, Avenatti had told Nike lawyers this month that a coach in Nike\xe2\x80\x99s grass-roots basketball league had approached him with information that company employees had paid the families of three players, prosecutors said. Avenatti, prosecutors said, demanded that Nike pay millions to make the whole thing go away.'
b'Paying players and their families would violate N.C.A.A. rules, rendering the players ineligible for college play. Also, if the money was paid in exchange for players to commit to colleges Nike sponsors, it would resemble the behavior that recently led to federal fraud convictions for two former Adidas employees.'
b'Two people familiar with the investigation confirmed that the unidentified coach in the complaint is Franklin. Nike had recently declined to renew its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme, which was worth more than $70,000 annually. Franklin could not be reached for comment.'
b'Grass-roots basketball is often erroneously called A.A.U. basketball, even in prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 court filings. That is a misnomer because the elite leagues are not sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union. Rather, they are supported by sneaker companies that spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to organize tournaments from April through July. The teenage players who participate are outfitted, from head to toe, in apparel made by and bearing the logo of the league\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor.'
b'Sneaker companies like Nike and Adidas also pay thousands of dollars each year to sponsor the teams themselves as a sort of long-term investment strategy: They hope to build brand loyalty among young players who could eventually become stars. Get players into your gear early, the thinking goes, and you may be more likely to land them as spokesmen when they turn pro and have even more influence over the world\xe2\x80\x99s fans \xe2\x80\x94 and their wallets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSneaker companies want to make money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California who was the executive producer of a 2016 documentary, \xe2\x80\x9cAt All Costs: Life Inside A.A.U. Basketball.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s their objective. And if you have a kid who\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to go on to the N.B.A., and he chooses to continue wearing these shoes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a long-term investment that could pay off for years.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At the same time, the grass-roots basketball landscape has shifted in recent years as N.B.A. players like Bradley Beal, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony have increasingly become involved in forming their own teams. These are players who already have partnerships with shoe companies and can help subsidize costs on their own. Last year, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who has an endorsement deal with Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Jordan brand, organized a Los Angeles-based team that advanced to the playoffs at the Peach Jam.'
b'Franklin was far from the N.B.A. when he started his team.'
b'A flattering portrait of Franklin is included in \xe2\x80\x9cPlay Their Hearts Out,\xe2\x80\x9d a 2010 book by George Dohrmann that details youth basketball culture in Southern California. Franklin, according to the book, played basketball and football at Los Angeles Valley College. Later, he doted on his son, Gary Jr., creating a club team he initially called the Runnin\xe2\x80\x99 Rebels. He preached fundamentals during their practices at Manual Arts High School and spoke openly about his faith in God. Gary Franklin Jr. went on to play college basketball at Baylor.'
b'Cal Supreme did not have lavish resources. When Brown, the Stanford player, was with the team, it practiced at various Los Angeles-area high schools. Parents subsidized costs. And players paid for their own meals at tournaments.'
b'Yet neither Brown nor his teammates were na\xc3\xafve about the world they inhabited.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody who played knew what was going on,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all knew people who were getting paid, we all knew people who were getting free stuff \xe2\x80\x94 we all knew it. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s all coming out. So it\xe2\x80\x99s shocking, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not shocking, because we all knew it was happening.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For years, the sponsorship deals have been heavily dependent on grass-roots coaches\xe2\x80\x99 attracting the best players to their programs. Cal Supreme appeared to have enough talent over the years to keep Nike interested, producing players who ultimately landed at major college programs like Southern California, Oregon and Arizona, along with several who went to the N.B.A.'
b'Big names circled in Cal Supreme\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. Miles Simon, a guard who had won an N.C.A.A. championship while playing at Arizona, was one of the program\xe2\x80\x99s coaches from 2011 to 2014. (Simon, who now works as an assistant for the Lakers, declined to comment through a Lakers spokeswoman.) Shareef O\xe2\x80\x99Neal, a top-tier recruit and the son of Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal, played for Cal Supreme before going to U.C.L.A. More recently, Percy Miller, the businessman and rapper known as Master P, was listed on Cal Supreme\xe2\x80\x99s website as a team partner.'
b'Ayton, who spent a season at Arizona before the Phoenix Suns made him the top overall pick in the 2018 N.B.A. draft, was Cal Supreme\xe2\x80\x99s highest-profile player. But in a twist, after years of wearing Nikes, Ayton signed a lucrative deal to wear Pumas when he went to the N.B.A. For Nike, it was an investment that did not pay off.'
b'It remains unclear whether Ayton\xe2\x80\x99s deal played any role in Nike\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to extend its sponsorship deal with Cal Supreme.'
b'Cassius Stanley, a top-30 recruit and a senior at Sierra Canyon High School outside Los Angeles, played for Cal Supreme in 2016 and for Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s team in 2018. His father, Jerome Stanley, who works as a lawyer, said that as far as he knew, Nike had never provided Cal Supreme players or their family members with benefits that would violate N.C.A.A. rules.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very sad that Coach Gary has gotten himself tangled up in this mess,\xe2\x80\x9d Stanley said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel bad for him and his family, and I pray that he and his lawyers can help him move on and not be damaged or used any more than he has been the past few days.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Zion Williamson of Duke insisted he doesn't know if he's going to declare for the NBA draft and leave Duke early."
b'Then his words seemingly betrayed him.'
b"After winning the John R. Wooden Award as the nation's outstanding men's player at the College Basketball Awards Friday night, he rattled off memories from his freshman year."
b'"Just being around each other on and off the court because it was more than basketball," Williamson said during the nationally televised show. "The brotherhood is something real. The bond we had built is second to none so I know I\'m going to miss that."'
b'Oops.'
b'Asked for the second time on the show if he was leaving early, he replied, "Like I said before, I don\'t know."'
b'Williamson is the sixth player from Duke to win the award named for the late UCLA coach, who won a record 10 NCAA championships.'
b"Williamson's trophy cabinet is already overstuffed. He has collected numerous awards \xe2\x80\x94 including The Associated Press player of the year \xe2\x80\x94 for his efforts in leading the Blue Devils to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. They lost 68-67 to Michigan State, denying themselves a trip to the Final Four."
b'Earlier, Williamson won the Karl Malone power forward trophy.'
b'"I don\'t regret nothing about this season," he said. "I enjoyed every moment of it."'
b"Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon was a surprise winner of the women's Wooden Award. She and Williamson shared the spotlight during the fifth annual ceremony at The Novo in downtown Los Angeles."
b'Her mouth dropped open when her name was announced. The NCAA Division I leader in career triple-doubles with 18, she led the Ducks on their first-ever Final Four run. The 21-year-old point guard plans to return for her senior year.'
b'"This award isn\'t won alone, so this goes out to my team, my family, my coaches, and everyone that made this possible," Ionescu said. "Growing up with two brothers, it wasn\'t easy. They never took it easy on me. We fought all the time. We played in the yard, and so this goes to them. They pushed me to my limits all the time."'
b"Ionescu beat out Connecticut's Napheesa Collier, Asia Durr of Louisville, Iowa's Megan Gustafson and Teaira McCowan of Mississippi State."
b'Gustafson had earned several postseason honors, including AP player of the year for leading the nation in scoring for the second straight season.'
b'Other winners were:'
b'\xe2\x80\x94 RJ Barrett of Duke, Jerry West shooting guard award'
b'\xe2\x80\x94 Rui Hachimura of Gonzaga, Julius Erving small forward award'
b'\xe2\x80\x94 Ethan Happ of Wisconsin, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar center award'

b'All of the award namesakes were on hand to present their trophies except Cousy, who is 90.'
b'Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger received the Wooden Legends of Coaching award from Steve Henson, his former player at Kansas State and current Texas-San Antonio coach.'
b"Kruger is 160-105 in eight seasons with the Sooners. He's the first Division I coach to guide five different schools to the NCAA Tournament."
b"The individual awards were decided by a combination of fan votes and input from the Basketball Hall of Fame's selection committee."

b'When Breanna Stewart, the reigning W.N.B.A. most valuable player, was carried off the floor of the Euroleague championship game in Hungary last weekend with a ruptured Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon, her pain was not just her own.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love Stewie and was heartbroken to hear about her injury, especially coming off an unbelievable W.N.B.A. season and World Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d Elena Delle Donne, the Washington Mystics star and a former league most valuable player, said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s just a great player, competitor and friend. She will be missed this year, but I know she will come back stronger than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stewart is not only a beloved player for the Seattle Storm; she is also a prominent symbol of an enduring issue in professional women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball in the United States: Its players\xe2\x80\x99 seasons never end.'
b'A rookie selected in this month\xe2\x80\x99s W.N.B.A. draft will make $41,265 to $53,537 in base salary, and nobody in the league will earn a base salary of as much as $120,000 this coming season.'
b'Because of that, many of the 144 players in the W.N.B.A. maximize their earning window by heading to Europe and Asia, where independent owners, free of salary caps, can offer them lucrative opportunities.'
b'There is a price to pay, however: endless seasons bleeding into one another; a physical, psychological and emotional toll; and, the players say, a heightened risk of injury.'
b'A few weeks ago, Victoria Vivians, a 2018 first-round pick of the Indiana Fever, tore her anterior cruciate ligament playing in Israel. She, like Stewart, will miss the 2019 W.N.B.A. season.'
b'These were only the biggest, latest injuries. Consider one by Amanda Zahui B., the Liberty center, who plays for Sopron Basket in Hungary.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just twisted my ankle really bad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a phone interview in the past week. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a swollen potato. But I got to practice through it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t really have the time to take off. Everyone twists their ankles. Everyone gets bone bruises in their knees and such.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'All of which elevates the question of how much W.N.B.A. players are paid, and whether a framework can be established to keep more of them in the United States during the league\xe2\x80\x99s off-season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said, everybody that plays overseas in the W.N.B.A. needs therapy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mystics guard Kristi Toliver, who spent a decade on the hamster wheel of women\xe2\x80\x99s professional basketball before being hired this off-season as an assistant coach for the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Wizards, said ahead of her 11th W.N.B.A. campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a real thing \xe2\x80\x94 just so much that you go through with the travel and, being away from loved ones, family or significant others, and trying to manage and deal with all these different things that are coming at you.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have a high-level job and you have to perform well in order to keep it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ending the financial need for nonstop play is a prime focus of Terri Jackson, president of the Women\xe2\x80\x99s National Basketball Players Association. It appears the league is supportive as well, which is not surprising, given that the quality of play would most likely rise and players who remained in their home market could promote their teams year-round.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a dream, a goal, of the union to grow the league to the point where players can work in it year-round and not have to endure the risks and the rigors of overseas play, of that 12-month calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter that concerns me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter that is top of mind for the executive committee and our larger C.B.A. committee.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That focus is particularly important right now, after the players\xe2\x80\x99 association opted out of its collective bargaining agreement with the league late last year. So the injury to Stewart, while reflecting a longstanding reality, has also shed new light on the way these players earn a living.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFirst and foremost, our thoughts are with Breanna and we wish her a speedy recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Tatum, the acting W.N.B.A. president and N.B.A. deputy commissioner, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cThe W.N.B.A. and its teams and players share a commitment to growing the league\xe2\x80\x99s business and building on our ongoing work to provide greater professional opportunities for players in the off-season.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The league has good reason to want a pathway to limiting, if not ending, overseas play from players: The teams are consistently affected by the toll it takes on its players.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe year-round play for W.N.B.A. players is a detriment to the W.N.B.A. product,\xe2\x80\x9d Minnesota Lynx Coach Cheryl Reeve said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe physical and mental toll it takes on the league\xe2\x80\x99s elite players is reflected in some of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best sitting out the W.N.B.A. season to \xe2\x80\x98rest,\xe2\x80\x99 as well as these players sustaining injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Reeve said the rest, which cuts into the W.N.B.A. season, is critical for elite players who \xe2\x80\x9care asked to perform at their highest levels day in and day out at home and abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible to sustain an elite level without these breaks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'The new way forward can take many forms, with changes in the base salary merely one of the tools available. Toliver, for instance, is coaching in the N.B.A. this season, but, because of restrictive rules in place from the previous C.B.A., is making just $10,000 to do so. A comprehensive pathway to getting W.N.B.A. players more opportunities on N.B.A. coaching staffs and in front offices during the W.N.B.A. off-season could significantly change the calculation for players by itself.'
b'Jackson spoke optimistically about how that process was going, though even the work to keep her own side informed requires time-zone gymnastics with her leadership scattered all over the world.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe could have a meeting at 10 a.m. or at 10 p.m., Eastern time, just because we have folks in, or we\xe2\x80\x99ve had folks in, Russia and Poland and China, Turkey,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so my executive committee just says get it done, so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we do.\xe2\x80\x9d She recalled an executive committee member, Nneka Ogwumike, jumping on a call from China at midnight.'
b'The two sides have until the conclusion of the 2019 season to come to an agreement.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe league has also signaled its willingness, its desire, to have a really collaborative relationship with the players, and to hear and to understand the concerns, and how to make this better,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is good forward movement. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That comes as welcome news to players like A\xe2\x80\x99ja Wilson, who has followed Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s path in many ways. Stewart was the top overall pick in 2016; Wilson in 2018. Like Stewart, Wilson won an N.C.A.A. championship, then was the W.N.B.A. rookie of the year. And like Stewart, Wilson went straight from college ball to the W.N.B.A. to a stint overseas last year, in China, before an injury ended her season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not an easy route at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes us just that elite as professional athletes. Because our bodies take on so much, but yet we still perform every single game. I mean, when Stewie got hurt she was in the championship game. She was playing at the highest level that she could overseas. It broke my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wilson, too, expressed hope that Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s injury would \xe2\x80\x9cshine a light\xe2\x80\x9d on this scheduling issue. Zahui B. agreed, though she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much time to worry about it: Her team is in the Hungarian league semifinals. If her team sweeps, she said, she will finish her season on May 2, then fly home to Sweden to see her family on May 3, before reporting to New York for training camp with the Liberty by May 8. On May 9, she will be at Barclays Center for New York\xe2\x80\x99s first preseason game, against the Chinese national team.'
b'She said she was looking forward to playing in the best women\xe2\x80\x99s professional league in the world. But as she attends to her aching ankle, she also echoed her fellow players on just how much better the league, and the professional experience, could be with some rest.'
b'And Toliver, who has now lived it, knows firsthand how right they are.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that now, entering the summer, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be so much more prepared to do so much more,\xe2\x80\x9d Toliver said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith what I was able to do with the off-season, I feel that the summer is going to be a breeze.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"TAMPA, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 Baylor and Notre Dame capped the women's college basketball season with a thrilling championship game."
b"The sport now has had a different champion in the past four years with the Lady Bears edging the Irish 82-81 on Sunday night to win their third title. It's only the second time in the past two decades that there have been that many teams claiming the title."
b'"Just a great game for women\'s basketball," Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said.'
b"The 11-point combined differential for the three games in the Final Four was the closest in the history of the tournament, topping last season's 15-point margin. More than 40,000 fans attended the Final Four games, which was the most since 2010. Overall, nearly 275,000 fans attended the entire tournament, which ranks eighth all-time, including 20,127 for the title game. It was the highest attendance in over 15 years for the NCAAs."
b'"We\'ve had a really great championship. Our first- and second-round numbers is the best we\'ve seen in 11 years," NCAA vice president for women\'s basketball Lynn Holzman said.'
b"There were a number of competitive games in the entire tournament, including Sunday night's title tilt. During the regular season, the Top 25 was upset and three different teams held the No. 1 spot in the poll, including Baylor, which was the most since 2012."
b'While 12 of the 15 players on the AP All-American teams will not be returning, the future is still bright with plenty of star power coming back.'
b'Oregon Ducks junior Sabrina Ionescu announced Saturday night that she was going to return for her senior season. She potentially could have gone to the WNBA this year.'
b"Notre Dame guard Jackie Young hasn't revealed her intentions yet. Like Ionescu, the junior turns 22 this year which makes her eligible for the WNBA draft."
b'Baylor forward Lauren Cox will be back at some point next year. She injured her left knee in the title game in the third quarter. Mulkey made it sound like Cox could miss at least some of next season because of the injury.'
b'"That kid, if she didn\'t get hurt, and she will be back, God works in mysterious ways, would have been the No. 1 probably pick in the draft next year," Mulkey said. "That kid probably would have been defensive player of the year nationally next year. That\'s how good she is. And she will be back, I promise you that. It may take her a year. We\'ll rest her, do whatever."'

b'CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 The families of several University of North Carolina women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball players complained last week of racially insensitive remarks by Sylvia Hatchell, the program\xe2\x80\x99s Hall of Fame coach, who was subsequently put on leave, according to two people with direct knowledge of the allegations.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, said in an interview Thursday that his client was aware of the accusations that were described in detail by one of the people with direct knowledge. He said his client\xe2\x80\x99s words had been misquoted or misconstrued.'
b'The families detailed their concerns in a meeting that some U.N.C. officials attended in Chapel Hill while the athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, joined by video conference from another location, according to the person who described the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.'
b'The meeting included accusations that Hatchell had warned that a loss to Louisville could lead to \xe2\x80\x9cnooses,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the person, and that the coach had once urged players to do a \xe2\x80\x9ctomahawk chop\xe2\x80\x9d war cry, a request the women resisted.'
b'Within days of the meeting, the university, which has been in the midst of a reckoning over racism and Confederate history, announced that Hatchell and her three assistants would be put on paid administrative leave while an outside law firm conducted a review to \xe2\x80\x9cassess the culture of the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The announcement stunned North Carolina and appeared abrupt, but in the discussion with university officials on March 28, players\xe2\x80\x99 relatives said Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s conduct had caused discomfort during at least two basketball seasons, according to the person.'
b'The families also told university officials that Hatchell had complained that her team played like \xe2\x80\x9cold mules\xe2\x80\x9d during a game against Georgia Tech \xe2\x80\x94 a remark that some took as a reference to female slaves and that caused at least one player to cry, according to the person.'
b'In another instance, according to the person, the families said that Hatchell had warned that if U.N.C. turned in a middling performance against Louisville, \xe2\x80\x9cnooses\xe2\x80\x9d would await.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you guys play this way against Louisville, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take y\xe2\x80\x99all outside with some nooses,\xe2\x80\x9d Hatchell said, according to the person, who was told of the remark by people who were present.'
b'The reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnooses,\xe2\x80\x9d the person said, led to two apologies from Hatchell, the second because players thought the first one had lacked sincerity. The players remained frustrated with their coach but elected to wait until the off-season to address their concerns.'
b'Smith said the coach had used different words when warning about the coming Louisville game. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said words like: \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re going to hang us out to dry. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer said.'
b'Smith said his client \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a racist bone in her body.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Allegations of racism against Hatchell were first reported by The Washington Post.'
b'Five days after U.N.C.\xe2\x80\x99s season ended, with a 20-point loss to California in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, the families voiced their grievances in the meeting.'
b'A North Carolina athletic department spokesman declined to comment. When the university announced the review on Monday, it said it was \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted to the well-being of our student-athletes and to ensuring that they have the best experience possible in and outside of competition.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'U.N.C. players either declined to comment or did not respond to messages. It was not clear which of the team\xe2\x80\x99s players were represented when the relatives spoke with Cunningham and the other U.N.C. employees. No members of the coaching staff attended the meeting, which was organized after some players\xe2\x80\x99 relatives held a conference call on March 25, the person said.'
b'Smith said Thursday that the coach\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of the tomahawk chop, often seen at Florida State athletic events, was a motivational tool, and he said that Hatchell had often tried to commandeer the traditions of other schools to inspire her team.'
b'The lawyer said that Hatchell had intended no offense in that episode and that she did not recall making any statements about \xe2\x80\x9cold mules.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The person who described the allegations against Hatchell did not know of any specific accusations against the assistant coaches.'
b'The North Carolina women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team has had great success under Hatchell, particularly in the 1990s and the 2000s. The Tar Heels won their sole national championship in 1994.'
b'Hatchell, who recently completed her 33rd season at North Carolina, is one of a handful of college basketball coaches with more than 1,000 career wins, and she is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In her first college coaching job, Hatchell oversaw the junior varsity team at Tennessee in the team\xe2\x80\x99s first season under Pat Summitt, a trailblazing head coach.'
b'But in this decade, North Carolina has only twice reached the second weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament, both times thanks to four players from its highly regarded recruiting class in 2013. After two seasons, all four players had transferred out of the program. This year, the team finished at 18-15.'
b'Smith said on Thursday that, despite the allegations, he hoped Hatchell would be able to return to coaching at North Carolina.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want her to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe this is a case in which things are not what they seem.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On Thursday morning, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s executive assistant sent an email to season-ticket holders. The season-end banquet had been postponed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose who have paid for tickets will be refunded,\xe2\x80\x9d the email said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the banquet is rescheduled, we will contact you with more information.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"NEW YORK \xe2\x80\x94 After a meandering search, St. John's finally settled on Mike Anderson as its new basketball coach."
b'Anderson was hired Friday by the Red Storm after getting fired at Arkansas last month. He also had head coaching stints with Missouri and UAB before leading the Razorbacks to five postseason appearances and a 169-102 record in eight seasons.'
b"Once he was let go, it didn't take long for Anderson to land another job. Terms of the contract were not disclosed."
b'"I\'ve been dreaming about this moment for the last nine days," St. John\'s athletic director Mike Cragg said during a news conference at Madison Square Garden. "And I found the right guy. We are going to win championships."'
b'The 59-year-old Anderson takes over for former St. John\'s star Chris Mullin, who resigned on April 9, citing a "recent personal loss." His older brother, Roddy, died last month at 58 after battling cancer for years.'
b"Anderson said he had not spoken to Mullin about the state of the program, but planned to reach out to him. Mullin guided the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament this year for the only time in his four seasons at the helm. They were immediately eliminated by Arizona State in a First Four game, and the school doesn't have an NCAA Tournament victory since 2000."
b"In the wake of Mullin's departure, St. John's drew criticism for being unable to lure initial coaching candidates during a protracted hiring process."
b"Arizona State's Bobby Hurley and Loyola-Chicago's Porter Moser were targeted before deciding to stay at their schools. Iona coach Tim Cluess said in a statement Thursday he was contacted but was withdrawing his name from consideration. And according to reports, St. John's spoke to Yale coach James Jones and former Georgia Tech and George Mason coach Paul Hewitt about the job as well."
b'In a radio interview Wednesday on WFAN, wealthy alum Mike Repole was critical of President Conrado "Bobby" Gempesaw, Vice President Joe Oliva, and the school\'s board of trustees.'
b'Ultimately, the Red Storm decided on Anderson, who is 369-200 in 17 seasons as a Division I head coach. He has never had a losing record.'
b"Neither Oliva nor Cragg would comment specifically on Repole's criticism, but both defended the process the school went through before picking Anderson."
b'"I would say nine days is a pretty thorough and efficient search," said Cragg, who came to St. John\'s from Duke last fall.'
b'Anderson, a native of Birmingham, Alabama, spent the first part of his career working for Nolan Richardson. Anderson played for Richardson at Tulsa before becoming an assistant under him with the Golden Hurricane.'
b'When Richardson left for Arkansas, Anderson joined him in Fayetteville. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas for 17 years, helping the Razorbacks win the 1995 national championship.'
b'Known for coaching up-tempo teams that press on defense, Anderson said his goal is to implement an exciting style of basketball that is "really entertaining." He said his teams would be "one of the top assist teams in the country."'
b'"They\'re going to be one of the top turnover teams in the country. One of the better scoring (and) field goal percentage teams," he added.'
b"Anderson said he envisions a team that's unpredictable."
b'"You don\'t know what we\'re going to do," he explained. "Our pressure may come from the half court. It may come full court. It may come from a zone. Now you\'ve got to worry about what we\'re doing. I don\'t worry about what teams do. I worry more about what we\'re doing."'
b"Anderson spoke briefly with St. John's players Mustapha Heron and L.J. Figueroa, who attended the news conference."
b'The new coach will have plenty of work to do in order to build a quality Big East roster for next season. Junior guards Shamorie Ponds and Justin Simon have declared for the NBA draft, while Figueroa and guard Bryan Trimble Jr. reportedly have placed their names in the transfer portal.'
b"Anderson, who doesn't have previous New York ties, said his plan is to recruit in the area."
b'"I had somebody ask me, \'Who\'s the guy who\'s going to recruit for you?\' My staff\'s going to recruit. That\'s who\'s going to recruit. Have three guys that are going to be recruiting and you\'re going to see me out there as well," Anderson said.'
b'"I think it comes down to building those relationships," he added. "I know that they\'re going to see me. They\'re going to get a chance to know me."'
b"Following the news conference, Anderson was scheduled to tour the school's on-campus facilities. He said the previous time he had been inside Carnesecca Arena was 2003 when he was the coach at UAB."
b'"I remember the last time I played (there), man, it was tight up in there," Anderson said. "I remember it being a really close environment and you put people on top of people, so I\'m looking forward to getting over there and (seeing) what (has) been done since those days."'

b'Ahead of two major shows, the painter Jonas Wood reflects on his early career \xe2\x80\x94 and the most unusual object in his studio.'
b'By Janelle Zara'
b'Jonas Wood\xe2\x80\x99s East Hollywood studio \xe2\x80\x94 a refurbished industrial space hidden behind a razor-wired metal gate \xe2\x80\x94 is populated with the familiar objects that appear in his paintings. There are colonies of potted plants and basketball paraphernalia that ranges in size from plush couch cushions to man-sized orbs. Every room is filled with art, most notably by the ceramist Shio Kusaka, Wood\xe2\x80\x99s studio mate and wife, and Kiki and Momo, their son and daughter. '
b'But the studio is where Wood culls various photographs from the internet or his own archive and uses them as source material for his paintings \xe2\x80\x94 they are printed out and pinned onto walls, then flattened and distilled into blocks of color. Wood then layers these dense graphic patterns, overlapping fields of stipples and stripes, circles, squares, dots and wood grains.'
b'[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]'
b'Thirteen years into his career, following a year and a half of preparation, Wood is finally wrapping up preparations for the two biggest shows he\xe2\x80\x99s ever done: an exhibition of new work at Gagosian in New York, opening in late April, and a survey at the Dallas Museum of Art, opening this week \xe2\x80\x94 his first major solo museum exhibition. Admittedly, the prospect of facing works \xe2\x80\x94 landscapes, interiors and portraits of family and friends \xe2\x80\x94 from his early career was giving Wood \xe2\x80\x9ca hard time sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d He wondered, \xe2\x80\x9cAre the old paintings horrible?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDid I used to be a better painter and now I\xe2\x80\x99m worse?\xe2\x80\x9d During the installation of the show at the museum last week, he had two big realizations: \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hack, which is a big relief,\xe2\x80\x9d and that now, after more than a decade of steadily producing gallery shows, he might be ready to slow down.'
b'Nursing a can of tangerine-flavored LaCroix, Wood answered T\xe2\x80\x99s Artist\xe2\x80\x99s Questionnaire, which unearthed memories of the early days of his career, the first painting he ever sold \xe2\x80\x94 and the YouTube videos that nearly brought him to tears.'
b'What is your day like? How much do you sleep, and what\xe2\x80\x99s your work schedule like?'
b'I drop the kids off at school, eat some breakfast, start working a little bit, usually have a meeting, have lunch and work for a couple hours in the afternoon. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll work for a couple hours at night. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to sleep more. In general, in the last couple of years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to balance sleeping, eating, working, working out and spending time with the family. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my head down trying to make it as an artist since 2006, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one or two shows a year for 12 years in a row. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I want to paint less, per se, but I want to take a step back.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about taking a step back and looking at what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, and taking a step back from the pace that I was running and changing gears. After these two exhibitions, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any booked shows coming up. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big opportunity for me to rearrange the way I spend my time. I love to paint and I want to paint, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to paint right now, this second, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to paint all next week and miss four school events.'
b'How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?'
b'Every day, I\xe2\x80\x99m super into it. I need to paint. If I go away for a couple weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just draw. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a must for my mental health. I would have to say that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been all-in on painting since I was younger, and I realized that it was because of a lot of fear that it would all go away. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how I want to paint in the future. The pressure and psychology of that setup isn\xe2\x80\x99t totally right. I would like to build bodies of work outside the calendar schedule of art fairs and shows for a little while. I love painting, and I think I can paint without having a giant carrot in front of me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I\xe2\x80\x99m the best at painting, and I want to get better at it.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the first piece of art you ever made?'
b'The first painting I really cared about was probably when I was a teenager, maybe 13 or 14 years old.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the worst studio you ever had?'
b'The freezing-cold basement of my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house on Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard. Winter of 2002.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the first work you ever sold? For how much?'
b'I sold a painting after college for $1,000, before grad school.'
b'When you start a new piece, where do you begin? What\xe2\x80\x99s the first step?'
b'I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of avoidance. I like to have things sit around for a while before it\xe2\x80\x99s go time. I find a photograph that I like, and then I usually make drawings. Maybe half the time I paint from the drawings and the other half from photographs. I use the photo for the structure of the painting; I project out different shapes, trace it out, mix the colors and build an image, like a flat map, and then I paint all the details on top. I like to have things just starting and just finishing and everywhere in between. I like to wake up and have choices to gravitate to.'
b'How do you know when you\xe2\x80\x99re done?'
b'You know after a lot of looking.'
b'How many assistants do you have?'
b'Two.'
b'What music do you play when you\xe2\x80\x99re making art?'
b'Mostly basketball podcasts. I listen to Howard Stern three days a week. Reggae, lots of eras of hip-hop, a variety of rock \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 roll.'
b'When did you first feel comfortable saying you\xe2\x80\x99re a professional artist?'
b'I was a slow learner and a late bloomer in painting. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really put it all together until 2006. I had a show at Black Dragon Society. I made $29,000, I quit my job, and after 2006, I was a full-time painter. Making a living from being an artist and not having to do anything else usually changes a lot \xe2\x80\x94 something happens, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s good, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s bad, right? But you spend all your time doing it. You\xe2\x80\x99re dedicated.'
b'Are you bingeing on any shows right now?'
b'Oh yeah. \xe2\x80\x9cCrashing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Dollar Listing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVanderpump Rules.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the weirdest object in your studio?'
b'This giant basketball is a sculpture by Paa Joe, a 72-year-old Ghanaian artist. Look him up. He makes fantasy coffins that are in most major museum collections. This was commissioned; I wanted a giant Spalding basketball, and I told him the colors and everything. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a coffin because my wife thought it would be too morbid, so we got a throne. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually called a palanquin, and you carry people around in it.'
b'How do you get your news?'
b'I just started listening to these quick little podcasts that The New York Times does. I read The New York Times. I go to CNN a little bit and check out some weirder news, like serial-killer names and stuff like that.'
b'What do you do when you\xe2\x80\x99re procrastinating?'
b'Play poker with friends. '
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing that made you cry?'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious that this made me cry: The kids wanted to watch N.B.A. players flying into the stands trying to get out-of-bounds balls. I was like, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is so cool that they\xe2\x80\x99re so into basketball.\xe2\x80\x9d Even thinking about it makes me \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s like happy crying. Positive. These kids want to see replays of Shaq, who\xe2\x80\x99s seven feet tall, flying into the stands. You should watch it.'
b'What do you usually wear when you work?'
b'Gym shorts and a T-shirt, or some sort of long, funky pants. I like to feel super comfortable.'
b'What do you buy in bulk with the most frequency?'
b'LaCroix. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a variety of favorite flavors.'
b'What do you pay for rent?'
b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t pay rent. We own the building.'
b'Do you exercise?'
b'We have a little gym. I would like to say that I\xe2\x80\x99m fat and I\xe2\x80\x99m also fit at the same time. I have a routine. VersaClimber and a lot of bands to strengthen the buttocks.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite artwork by someone else?'
b'I love that Picasso goat he made out of bronze, where he uses a basket for the goat\xe2\x80\x99s tummy. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the great bronze sculptures.'
b'This interview has been edited and condensed.'
b'An earlier version of this article misstated where Jonas Wood and his family reside. They live on the Westside of Los Angeles, not in an apartment above his studio. The article also gave an incorrect opening date for Wood\xe2\x80\x99s exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art; it was March 24, not March 29.'

b'CHARLOTTE, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Consider the following scenes from the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s annual bacchanal/business convention known as All-Star weekend:'
b'Spike Lee standing on a street corner waiting for the crosswalk signal. Stan Kroenke, whose family owns the Denver Nuggets, holding court in a hotel lobby. Joel Embiid, the star center of the Philadelphia 76ers, making small talk with the governor of North Carolina. An army of personal stylists waiting to be summoned by their clients for some of the flashiest events of the year.'
b'And then there were the agents and league officials and sneakerheads and reporters, some of whom traveled great distances to make unconventional requests of the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s main attractions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShout out to my fans in Mongolia!\xe2\x80\x9d John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks yelled into a camera the morning before his appearance in the Saturday slam dunk contest.'
b'[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo\xe2\x80\x99s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]'
b'All-Star weekend tends to be a blend of basketball and branding, business and pleasure \xe2\x80\x94 a showcase for a powerful league whose global influence continues to expand.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole weekend,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies said, \xe2\x80\x9cis just a big party.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The All-Star Game itself, scheduled for Sunday night, felt secondary to just about everything else in the host city, as it has for many years. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, recalled waiting in line in 2006 for one of the more popular parties at All-Star weekend in Houston, where he watched Maciej Lampe \xe2\x80\x94 a center from Poland who appeared in 64 career games over parts of three seasons \xe2\x80\x94 bypass the line so that he could immediately be waved inside by security.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98Man, I\xe2\x80\x99m behind Maciej Lampe?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Morey, who would officially join the front office of the Rockets a little more than six weeks later.'
b'All-Star weekend has only grown in recent years. One spreadsheet making the rounds in Charlotte listed more than 100 parties, and that did not include many of the more exclusive events. (Michael Jordan hosted a big one.) Thanks to a change in the league schedule, there is more partying and less deal-making than there used to be.'
b'Last year, the league moved the trade deadline up so that it preceded All-Star weekend. In the past, the deadline came a few days after the game, a sequence which helped create its share of absurdity. One of the more notorious examples came in 2017, when word leaked during the fourth quarter of the All-Star Game that the New Orleans Pelicans had struck a deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings. Cousins learned of the trade during postgame interviews.'
b'The weekend vibe is different now.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so much more fun,\xe2\x80\x9d one prominent agent said at a party that he hosted.'
b'In the corner, a disc jockey who appeared to be in his 60s spun tunes in a Hawaiian shirt and red-tinted glasses, while women wearing bright red dresses passed out hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres. Agents, clients and marketing honchos milled about the room.'
b'But none of this is meant to suggest that deals do not get done.'
b'On Thursday night, at a downtown hotel bar where patrons sipped $25 cocktails, a crowd of very tall men gathered as a private event wound down at a nearby steakhouse. Among the luminaries who emerged from the event: Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner; Kroenke, who also owns the Los Angeles Rams; Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.\xe2\x80\x99s chief media and business officer; Bill Simmons, the founder of The Ringer; Connor Schell, ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice president for content; and Bob Myers, the general manager of the Golden State Warriors.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are definitely conversations happening,\xe2\x80\x9d Morey said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s serendipity involved. You\xe2\x80\x99re always bumping into people.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Morey was finishing lunch at an upscale restaurant. Warren LeGarie, a longtime agent to many coaches and executives, and Kiki Vandeweghe, the league\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice president for basketball operations, were dining at nearby tables. Morey was about to head into a meeting with Vandeweghe and Monty McCutchen, who supervises the league\xe2\x80\x99s referees.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, we care deeply about where the league is going,\xe2\x80\x9d Morey said, \xe2\x80\x9cso talking to Adam Silver about strategy or Monty McCutchen about changing how they might call certain things \xe2\x80\x94 all that kind of stuff could impact our franchise moving forward, so I try to be involved.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The atmosphere may seem more relaxed than it was two years ago, when most team executives and agents were focused on the trade deadline, but the shift in the schedule has not pushed aside the league\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing issues.'
b'In Charlotte, a cloud loomed over the festivities, and it came in the shape of a unibrow.'
b'Perhaps you have heard? Anthony Davis, the star center for the Pelicans, requested a trade 10 days before the deadline.'
b'The Pelicans, though, rejected all trade offers for him and instead hope to reap better players and draft picks in a deal this summer. Last week, Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry called the drama of it all a \xe2\x80\x9cdumpster fire.\xe2\x80\x9d On Friday, the Pelicans fired their general manager. On Saturday, Davis told reporters that his list of preferred destinations included the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. Hours later, Silver said he would like trade demands and discussions to remain behind closed doors.'
b'In any case, the Davis situation only underscored how much the topic of player movement dominates the league \xe2\x80\x94 even in the middle of the season, and even after the trade deadline. Everyone here was fixated on what could happen just over four months from now \xe2\x80\x94 at the start of free agency.'
b'Will Kevin Durant leave the Warriors? Will Kawhi Leonard spurn the Toronto Raptors? Will Kyrie Irving bolt from the Boston Celtics? And, again, what about Davis?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo one likes to see an instance,\xe2\x80\x9d Silver said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a player is demanding that he be traded when he\xe2\x80\x99s still in the middle of a contractual obligation to a team.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Silver made those remarks, and his wish for private trade discussions, at a news conference before Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s skills, dunk and 3-point competitions.'
b'The media forum, like the carefully coordinated outfits stars wore to events around town, has become part of the event\xe2\x80\x99s routine. So has the roll call of courtside A-listers during the dunk contest; this year\xe2\x80\x99s included the rappers Quavo, 2 Chainz, J. Cole and Gucci Mane.'
b'All-Star weekend was not always so structured \xe2\x80\x94 or extravagant. Paul Westphal recalled making his first trip to an All-Star Game in 1977 as a guard for the Phoenix Suns. The league hosted a modest dinner. Players received commemorative mugs. Anyone associated with the game stayed at the same hotel in downtown Milwaukee.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like it is now where the game takes over the whole city,\xe2\x80\x9d Westphal said.'
b'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar missed practice, Westphal said, then showed up about 20 minutes before the start of the game in a fur coat. Westphal helped seal his team\xe2\x80\x99s win with a late steal against Pete Maravich. It was a moment he said he would never forget.'
b'This weekend, Westphal was in Charlotte, where he was named a finalist for the Basketball Hall of Fame. He said he was not planning to attend any parties.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust dinner with friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'In Charlotte, the streets around the host arena, Spectrum Center, were choked with traffic. Concert fliers hung from every lamppost. And none of the guests, spread among numerous hotels at premium nightly rates, seemed to mind the cold weather as countless lines formed for restaurants, bars and pop-up musical performances.'
b'Given all the extracurriculars, it was easy to forget that basketball was the only reason anyone was here in the first place \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps that was because the only legitimate basketball was being played in a college gymnasium a few miles from downtown. A group of elite teenage prospects, without much fanfare, had convened for the league\xe2\x80\x99s annual Basketball Without Borders Global Camp.'
b'In all, 63 boys and girls from 31 countries played in front of scouts and executives who hoped to identify the sport\xe2\x80\x99s next batch of stars.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talent here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brooks Meek, the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s vice president for international basketball operations.'

b'Marc Stein, an N.B.A. reporter for more than 30 years who now covers the league for The New York Times, and Ralph Lawler, longtime broadcaster for the Los Angeles Clippers, were honored on Friday by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which named them as the 2019 Curt Gowdy Media Award recipients for their contributions to basketball.'
b'Stein, 49, and Lawler, 80, will be among those honored at the Hall of Fame\xe2\x80\x99s September enshrinement ceremonies in Springfield, Mass.'
b'Stein started his career covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for The Los Angeles Daily News, before moving to The Dallas Morning News as a Mavericks beat reporter and eventually a national columnist. From there, he went to ESPN for 15 years, developing a reputation for breaking news and helping the network build its digital coverage of the N.B.A. He joined The Times in 2017.'
b'Lawler has announced that he will retire at the end of this season after more than 2,000 broadcasts in his 30 years with the Clippers. He established his reputation as a broadcaster in Philadelphia, working on Phillies, Flyers and 76ers games.'
b'The Hall of Fame also announced 13 finalists for induction this year, including four first-time finalists: Marques Johnson, the 1977 national collegiate player of the year; Jack Sikma, a seven-time N.B.A. All-Star; Ben Wallace, a four-time recipient of the Defensive Player of the Year Award; and Paul Westphal, a four-time All-Star and a longtime coach.'
b'The other finalists are Leta Andrews, Hugh Evans, Bill Fitch, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Barbara Stevens, Eddie Sutton, Teresa Weatherspoon and Chris Webber.'

b'A student at a Catholic school in Kentucky has sued the Northern Kentucky Health Department, claiming it violated his First Amendment rights by barring him from playing basketball because he refused to be vaccinated against chickenpox.'
b'The lawsuit, filed last week in Boone County Circuit Court on behalf of the student, Jerome Kunkel, an 18-year-old senior, argues that the action violates his right to freedom of religion. Being vaccinated, it contends, would go against Mr. Kunkel\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs as a practicing Catholic, because the vaccine contains \xe2\x80\x9caborted fetal cells.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The lawsuit came after an outbreak of chickenpox at Assumption Academy in Walton, Ky., prompted officials to send out two warnings in February.'
b'On March 14, the Health Department issued a statement saying that because there had been 32 cases of chickenpox at the school, students who were not vaccinated or already immune could not attend school \xe2\x80\x9cuntil 21 days after the onset of rash for the last ill student or staff member.\xe2\x80\x9d The statement also said all school extracurricular events would be canceled.'
b'Mr. Kunkel\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Chris Wiest, said in an interview on Monday that the school had told him in February that he could not play in or attend any basketball games because he was not vaccinated.'
b'Mr. Kunkel is also now barred from attending school because of the Health Department\xe2\x80\x99s action.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty devastated,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kunkel, who was captain of the basketball team, said in an interview on Monday night. After playing for all four years of high school, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it come crashing down at the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s not very fun,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. Mr. Kunkel was not able to play in the last three games of the season.'
b'The lawsuit contends that in Kentucky, students are allowed a vaccination exemption on religious grounds if they provide a sworn statement, which Mr. Kunkel did in early 2018.'
b'The chickenpox vaccine is grown in cells originally derived from fetuses aborted in the early 1960s. Vaccines may contain nanofragments of DNA from the fetal cells, which are used because human viruses do not grow well in animal cells, according to a statement the vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer, Merck, gave to ABC News.'
b'It is unclear how many students have been barred from attending the school because they have not been vaccinated or were found to be immune. Mr. Wiest, however, said that the parents of at least 18 children at the school had contacted him since the Health Department\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is going to be a much bigger fight at the end of the day,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wiest said.'
b'Officials at the school did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. But the Health Department defended its response to the outbreak.'
b'The action, the department said in its statement, was \xe2\x80\x9cin direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.\xe2\x80\x9d A spokesman for the department declined to comment further.'

b'Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down on Sunday after a rocky tenure in which she supported President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line immigration policies even as he blamed her for the increased number of migrants illegally entering the U.S. (Read her resignation letter.)'
b'After assuming the post in late 2017, Ms. Nielsen led the department during the administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d policy along the Mexican border, which initially resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: Mr. Trump named Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. In announcing a recent spike in the number of illegal border crossings, Mr. McAleenan said last month, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is clearly both a border security and a humanitarian crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Catch up: On Friday, Mr. Trump withdrew his nominee to run Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald Vitiello, saying he wanted the agency to go in a \xe2\x80\x9ctougher\xe2\x80\x9d direction.'
b'Fighting for survival before parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unexpectedly promised over the weekend to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re-elected.'
b'The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians, who view the area as the possible site of a future Palestinian state.'
b'Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s major rival, the former army chief Benny Gantz, and analysts dismissed the plan as a last-ditch effort to rally Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s right-wing base.'
b'Explainer: Mr. Netanyahu is one of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving leaders, but he is facing his strongest challenge in years from Mr. Gantz and the leaders of a centrist alliance. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a guide to Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s voting. '
b'Antibiotics, which have been credited with saving tens of millions of lives, have never been more accessible to the poor, thanks largely to the mass production of generics in China and India. Across much of the developing world, a few dollars will buy drugs like amoxicillin, which treats a broad range of infections.'
b'But the increasingly available drugs are losing their ability to kill the germs they were designed to cure. Poverty is a huge and largely unappreciated driver of antibiotic resistance, which is often viewed as a problem in rich countries.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are quickly running out of treatment options,\xe2\x80\x9d a researcher in Kenya said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a handle on the problem, I fear for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Another angle: A fungus called Candida auris preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. It adds a frightening new dimension to the threat posed by the overuse of antibiotics.'
b'Jake Orta lives three blocks from Mark Zuckerberg\xe2\x80\x99s $10 million home in San Francisco. A military veteran who now lives in government-subsidized housing, Mr. Orta is part of an underground economy, scavenging through others\xe2\x80\x99 trash.'
b'Mr. Orta sells what he retrieves around town and says his goal is to earn around $30 to $40 a day.'
b'Our reporter, who followed Mr. Orta through the alleys of San Francisco, offers a snapshot of the extremes of American capitalism.'
b'Quotable: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got more and more tech people here and this city is moving faster and faster,\xe2\x80\x9d said a spokesman for a contractor that collects San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s garbage. \xe2\x80\x9cThese people have short attention spans. Some discard items that ought to be repurposed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'On a monthlong trip in Honduras, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a photographer explored the rampant corruption and gang violence that is leading thousands of women to seek asylum in the U.S. Our Opinion section published their collaboration.'
b'The country is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s deadliest for women, and the city above, Choloma, is one of the most dangerous. Domestic violence is common, and many women are killed by drug cartels and gangs, often in ways intended to spread terror. '
b'Battle in Libya: The U.S. military evacuated its small contingent of troops from the Libyan capital, Tripoli, as rival militias fought to stop an aspiring strongman from taking control of the city.'
b'Internet regulation: Britain has proposed sweeping government powers to fight the online spread of violent and extremist content, false information, and harmful material aimed at children. The plan announced today would be one of the most aggressive to rein in corrosive online content.'
b'Democrats and the death penalty: After California\xe2\x80\x99s governor issued a moratorium on executions, Democratic presidential candidates have embraced abolition. It represents a generational shift for the party but follows a decades-long trend in declining public support for capital punishment.'
b'Snapshot: Above, Baylor won its third N.C.A.A. women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball championship on Sunday, defeating Notre Dame, 82-81. Texas Tech and Virginia play for the men\xe2\x80\x99s title tonight.'
b'Theater review: A revival of the 1943 musical \xe2\x80\x9cOklahoma!\xe2\x80\x9d opened at the Circle in the Square Theater in Manhattan on Sunday. Our critic calls it \xe2\x80\x9cthe coolest new show on Broadway.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The choice of location raises a question: When problems erupt in the region, is there a dominant city where they\xe2\x80\x99re hammered out?'
b'Not exactly.'
b'The city with the largest population is Mexico City. The regional finance capital is Panama City. Bras\xc3\xadlia is the capital of Brazil, which has the continent\xe2\x80\x99s biggest economy. Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s exiles \xe2\x80\x94 from Cubans to the Venezuelans themselves \xe2\x80\x94 head north to Miami, where Spanish is often more common than English.'
b'A peace agreement with Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s rebels was hammered out in Havana, which has longstanding ties to both the rebels and the Colombian government.'
b'While other parts of the world have centers of gravity \xe2\x80\x94 think of Beijing, Brussels and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 Latin America is still searching for its own.'

b'(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the sign-up.)'
b'Good morning,'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99re covering a purge at the Department of Homeland Security, today\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections in Israel, and the N.C.A.A. men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball championship.'
b'Mr. Trump moved on Monday to clear out the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security, a day after the resignation of its secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.'
b'The White House announced the departure of the director of the Secret Service, Randolph Alles, and more high-ranking officials are expected to leave soon.'
b'The moves reflected the president\xe2\x80\x99s frustration about immigration and security, and appeared to be a housecleaning of officials associated with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff who was also Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first Homeland Security secretary.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s push for tougher immigration policies includes the possible return of a measure that separated migrant families, current and former officials said. '
b'The Daily: In today\xe2\x80\x99s episode, a reporter who covers immigration for The Times discusses Ms. Nielsen\xe2\x80\x99s tenure.'
b'Another angle: In clamping down on migrants, Mr. Trump has said \xe2\x80\x9cOur country is full.\xe2\x80\x9d Demographers and economists disagree. '
b'The country heads into parliamentary elections today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a veteran politician of the Israeli right, facing stiff competition from a centrist rival, Benny Gantz, a former army general. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a look at the voting process and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.'
b'Mr. Netanyahu has overseen healthy economic growth, but charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust have loomed over his campaign. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have live coverage as the polls close at 3 p.m. Eastern.'
b'News analysis: Mr. Netanyahu has promised to begin annexing parts of the West Bank, which would flout four decades of U.S. policy. He was emboldened by President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s support, our White House correspondent writes.'
b'Yesterday: In another move that could help Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump designated a powerful arm of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s military \xe2\x80\x94 the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps \xe2\x80\x94 as a foreign terrorist organization. It was the first time the U.S. has made such a declaration about part of another country\xe2\x80\x99s government. Mr. Netanyahu and Trump administration officials have said Iran is the greatest threat facing Israel.'
b'Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Sudan are demanding the departure of the country\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian ruler. Algeria\xe2\x80\x99s longtime leader was forced out. And in Libya, an aging general is promising to end the chaos that followed the ouster of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011.'
b'The uprisings across the Arab world eight years ago are still reverberating across North Africa, but the renewed unrest shows that the problems that led to the earlier uprisings remain. Those include growing populations of disaffected young people, closed and corrupt economies, and authoritarian governments unresponsive to the public.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is to meet President Trump at the White House today. Mr. el-Sisi, 64, is seeking at least a tacit blessing before a referendum to change the Egyptian constitution so that he can stay in power until 2034 \xe2\x80\x94 in effect, as president for life.'
b'Kelly Catlin, 23, won a silver medal in cycling at the 2016 Olympics and had a shot at gold at the 2020 Games. She was also a graduate student in computational mathematics at Stanford, setting up opportunities off the track. '
b'That seemingly solid path made her downward spiral all the more mystifying to loved ones. She was found dead in her apartment last month.'
b'Quotable: Her father, Dr. Mark Catlin, blames several factors for her suicide, including a concussion in January. \xe2\x80\x9cI wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder what she would\xe2\x80\x99ve done with her life.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Boeing 737 Max jet that crashed twice in five months relied on decades-old systems and left pilots without some common safety features.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was state of the art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said a former engineer who helped design the Max\xe2\x80\x99s cockpit. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a good airplane for the current environment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Attorney general in Congress: William Barr is scheduled to testify today and Wednesday to discuss the Justice Department budget. Some lawmakers are expected to question him over his handling of the special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s report.'
b'Saudis barred: Sixteen Saudis, including a top aide to Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will be denied entry to the U.S., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday. The Trump administration has been criticized for playing down C.I.A. findings that show Prince Mohammed played a role in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.'
b'Mar-a-Lago arrest: The Chinese woman who was arrested at President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Florida resort had a device to detect hidden cameras and $8,000 in a hotel room, a federal prosecutor has said.'
b'College admissions scandal: Fourteen people, including the actress Felicity Huffman, will plead guilty, prosecutors have said. Fifty people were charged in the case, which involved faked test scores, phony athletic credentials and big payments.'
b'The 2020 election: And then there were 18. Representative Eric Swalwell of California has joined the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates. Keep track here.'
b'Storm threat in Midwest: An unusually powerful storm this week comes after one last month that resulted in widespread flooding in the region.'
b'Convictions in Hong Kong protests: Nine pro-democracy activists face prison terms of up to seven years after being convicted today for their roles in widespread protests in the city in 2014.'
b'Snapshot: Above, Virginia won its first N.C.A.A. men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball championship on Monday, defeating Texas Tech, 85-77, in overtime. The game was the first in 40 years between men\xe2\x80\x99s teams that had previously never played for the title.'
b'Late-night comedy: Jimmy Kimmel was among the hosts who bid farewell to the departing Homeland Security secretary: \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye Kirstjen. Whoever replaces you permanently is going to have some very big cages to fill.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'What we\xe2\x80\x99re reading: This article in Popula. Anna Holland, an editor based in London, recommends it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of the best pieces on climate change I\xe2\x80\x99ve read in a very long time. It asks tough questions of everyone \xe2\x80\x94 not just those on the hunt for a luxury apartment in Miami Beach.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Cook: Spicy sausage and butternut squash are a perfect match. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)'
b'Watch: \xe2\x80\x9cFosse/Verdon,\xe2\x80\x9d FX\xe2\x80\x99s biopic mini-series, premieres tonight and assumes a thorough knowledge of Broadway. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a cheat sheet.'
b'Go: \xe2\x80\x9cOasis\xe2\x80\x9d is a charming, cheering piece of site-specific theater in Lower Manhattan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Critic\xe2\x80\x99s Pick.'
b'Listen: \xe2\x80\x9cOld Town Road,\xe2\x80\x9d the hit by the rapper Lil Nas X that set off a debate about what might be country music, is the focus of our pop podcast.'
b'Smarter Living: Organize your kitchen like a professional chef to keep ingredients and tools handy. Separate cookware by function: prep, cook, serve, store. Date spices and keep them in transparent containers. And good knife skills can replace many gadgets.'
b'We also have tips for securely mounting your flat-screen TV.'
b'Lately, leggings have become a cultural lightning rod. But a retrospective of the British designer Mary Quant reminds us of an earlier fashion flash point: the miniskirt.'
b'Ms. Quant, a trailblazer of Swinging Sixties fashion, famously said she \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to wait for women\xe2\x80\x99s lib.\xe2\x80\x9d Her higher-than-high hemlines insisted on young women\xe2\x80\x99s right to bare their legs.'
b'She named the skirt after her favorite car, the original Mini Cooper.'
b'Pieces of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists as far back as the 1300s B.C., but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the mid-20th century that the mini took off. Staying true to the Hemline Index (whereby skirt hemlines rise with stock prices), the miniskirt perfectly captured 1960s London. The trend has followed a boom-and-bust cycle ever since.'
b'Bans on short skirts are enforced in several African countries, however, and wearing a mini can prompt outrage \xe2\x80\x94 and even arrest \xe2\x80\x94 in parts of the Middle East.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s it for this briefing. See you next time.'

b'CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Sylvia Hatchell, the University of North Carolina women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach, used to preach about \xe2\x80\x9cthe fishbowl.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always in the fishbowl,\xe2\x80\x9d Hatchell would tell players like Tonya Sampson, a former player who recalled the admonitions in an interview on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never know who\xe2\x80\x99s watching. You\xe2\x80\x99ve always got to carry yourself with integrity and the best way you can.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Twenty-five years after Hatchell and Sampson won a national title for North Carolina, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s reputation is in peril and her team is in turmoil. U.N.C. officials, who were told late last month about three episodes that some players thought revealed Hatchell to be racially insensitive and aloof, placed her and her assistants on paid administrative leave and opened a storied program to abrupt scrutiny.'
b'An outside law firm is investigating. Several U.N.C. players are considering transferring. And Hatchell, 67, one of women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball\xe2\x80\x99s most successful and influential coaches and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, is not talking beyond a single written statement.'
b'It seems no one, from high-ranking state lawmakers to parents of players, is certain whether she will coach again at U.N.C., a Southern powerhouse of athletics and academics that has spent years grappling with issues of race. Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Wade M. Smith, could only say, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope she does come back.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The allegations against Hatchell, privately detailed to university officials on March 28 and in news media accounts in the week that followed, represent a grave test to her 33-year tenure at U.N.C., where she is under contract for just one more season. And although the just-concluded season was modestly more successful than other recent campaigns, Hatchell has lately led a program that felt removed from the one that, not long ago, routinely won at least 25 games a year.'
b'This year, in its first appearance in the N.C.A.A. women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball tournament since the 2014-15 season, U.N.C. (18-15) exited in the first round with a 20-point loss to California.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s critics have been reluctant to speak publicly, in part, they said, because they fear retaliation. After so many years, Hatchell has become an institution at U.N.C., not quite on par with Dean Smith, the revered former men\xe2\x80\x99s coach, but not far off. Many current and former players did not respond to messages, but some who did expressed support for Hatchell, even as they depicted her as a coach of searing, drawling intensity.'
b'The university said it had hired a Charlotte law firm to \xe2\x80\x9cassess the culture of the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball program and the experience of our student-athletes.\xe2\x80\x9d Officials have declined to comment beyond that.'
b'The law firm is expected to examine the quality of medical care for players and whether Hatchell had warned her team that \xe2\x80\x9cnooses\xe2\x80\x9d would await them if they turned in a poor performance against Louisville. U.N.C. officials were also told that Hatchell had urged her players to perform a \xe2\x80\x9ctomahawk chop\xe2\x80\x9d war cry to fire them up \xe2\x80\x94 a suggestion the women resisted \xe2\x80\x94 and that she had described players as \xe2\x80\x9cold mules.\xe2\x80\x9d Some people perceived the comment as a reference to female slaves.'
b'Smith, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, said the coach \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a racist bone in her body.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He said some players had misconstrued Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s words, but he acknowledged that she had apologized after an internal uproar about the episode in which people recalled that she had referred to nooses.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe said words like, \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re going to hang us out to dry. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a rope and hang us out to dry,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Smith said. He added that Hatchell, who did not believe she had said anything improper, initially apologized by saying something like, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you took it that way.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe team did not see that as an apology,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she thought she apologized.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But a furor still built, and the university, whose trustees declined to comment or did not respond to messages, will soon have to decide the fate of the coach, who cultivated the modern women\xe2\x80\x99s game and has been known more for her fiery courtside coaching than personal controversy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never encountered any kind of racial slurs or racism,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nikki Teasley, a former U.N.C. point guard who went on to a long career in the W.N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x9cMy experience with Coach Hatchell was very heartfelt, very loving, very kind.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Teasley, who is African-American, said she did not recall any racially improper comments but did say Hatchell was fierce and demanding.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter playing and then becoming a coach myself and then a mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou understand that sometimes things do get overheated, and in the heat of the moment you do say some things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hatchell grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small city 20 miles west of Charlotte, and graduated from a public high school that had only recently integrated. Judge Jesse B. Caldwell III, who graduated from Hunter Huss High School a few years ahead of Hatchell, recalled little friction over integration in the area. Basketball, he said, helped bring people together. At nearby Ashley High School, an integrated team won a state championship in 1967.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s school did not have a women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team when she was a student. She began coaching as an undergraduate, and she took control of the North Carolina program, already an emerging incubator of basketball players, in 1986.'
b'She became known as a skilled recruiter and drew some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top basketball talent to Chapel Hill. Yet to people in and around her program, Hatchell sometimes seemed to be more of a chief executive than a coach. Andrew Calder, a Hatchell deputy since her arrival at U.N.C., was often credited with developing players.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI learned the game through Coach Calder,\xe2\x80\x9d Sampson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou knew who the head coach was, but hands-on, no, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hands-on when I was there.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To a point, the formula worked. Lifted by a 3-point shot as time expired, the Tar Heels won their only women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball title in 1994. Including that season, the Tar Heels have reached the Final Four three times \xe2\x80\x94 far less than programs like Connecticut, Tennessee and Notre Dame.'
b'At their best, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s teams played with an attractive, fast-paced style that relied on fast breaks and smart point-guard play. This season she continued to tout her up-tempo offense.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s stature has grown in a state where college basketball is prized. She missed one season, in 2013-14, for cancer treatment, but the next season North Carolina went 26-9 and finished with a No. 9 ranking.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s comeback era came as U.N.C. wrestled with an academic fraud scandal that reached into the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball program. Although the university was not punished, years of bad headlines, investigations and speculation took a toll. Some players cited the scandal when they chose to transfer elsewhere.'
b'Hatchell, though, remained and, in 2016, received a contract extension. Last year, she signed a deal with Nike: $150,000 for up to four personal appearances a year until 2028. (The contract ends early if Hatchell leaves as head coach.)'
b'Beyond basketball, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s Christian faith has long been central to her life and her public persona. More than a decade ago, she started a women\xe2\x80\x99s Bible study in the Chapel Hill area. For the last six years, the teacher has been Rachel-Ruth Wright, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the North Carolina evangelist.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard her say one negative thing about any of her players,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Wright said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s always positive, always excited. She\xe2\x80\x99s just an encouragement all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The university\xe2\x80\x99s investigation might answer if she went too far in doing so. The Charlotte Observer this week published a scathing editorial about the conduct of college coaches.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOther women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball programs, including Georgia Tech, have fired coaches in recent years for mistreating players,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper, among the state\xe2\x80\x99s most widely read, wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIf U.N.C. finds abuse from any coach \xe2\x80\x94 men\xe2\x80\x99s or women\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 it should do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Weeks ago, Hatchell appeared in high spirits at a commemoration of U.N.C.\xe2\x80\x99s only national title.'
b'Hatchell visited a pregame lunch for members of that 1994 championship team, who were later honored on the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe hugged me. \xe2\x80\x98Glad to see you\xe2\x80\x99 kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Sampson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen she was off, because she had to get prepared for the game.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Good morning.'
b'(Here\xe2\x80\x99s the sign-up, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t already get California Today by email.)'
b'This year the best college basketball team from California is not U.C.L.A.; it is not Stanford, or San Diego State.'
b'No, this year, the best college basketball team from California might just be the University of California, Irvine.'
b'Yes, you read that right. The Anteaters. (Zot! Zot! Zot!)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re one of the top teams on the West Coast, and we have proven we\xe2\x80\x99re probably the best team in California,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan Badrtalei, an assistant coach at U.C. Irvine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.'
b'Of course, claims like these are hotly debated at this time of year. But on Sunday, the N.C.A.A. selection committee announced the 68 teams that will play in the Division I men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball tournament, and only two of them were from California: U.C. Irvine and Saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, which earned its bid by winning the West Coast Conference tournament.'
b'Badrtalei certainly has a case. U.C. Irvine beat Saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s this season on its way to a 30-5 record, good enough to earn the team a No. 13 seed in the South Region of the N.C.A.A. tournament. U.C. Irvine will play Kansas State on Friday in San Jose.'
b'The No. 13 seed means the Anteaters are an underdog in that game. But the team has also been a trendy upset pick among experts, some of whom think the team could make something of a Cinderella run.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Anteaters are a terrible draw for Kansas State, and their upset odds are two times better than you would expect for a typical No. 13 seed,\xe2\x80\x9d The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Neil Greenberg wrote Sunday after the bracket was unveiled. '
b'Badrtalei said this year\xe2\x80\x99s team features several upperclassmen who have helped them beat squads like Texas A&M and Saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s on the road \xe2\x80\x94 wins that give the Anteaters confidence that they can hang with stiff competition.'
b'Veteran players like Jonathan Galloway, who is a first team all-conference selection, has helped anchor the Anteaters defensively. The team prides itself on rebounding well and being a \xe2\x80\x9ca real stubborn defensive team,\xe2\x80\x9d Badrtalei said, adding that Kansas State plays a similar style.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to go out and play really well,\xe2\x80\x9d Badrtalei said of Friday\xe2\x80\x99s matchup. \xe2\x80\x9cBut these guys know their roles. They know what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. We purposely recruit guys who have a chip on their shoulders. We like that. We like being in the position where we have to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So can they pull off the upset?'
b'Said Badrtalei: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a question in our minds.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday sentenced three men in a college basketball fraud case to between six and nine months in prison, lenient sentences that the judge said were nonetheless important to deter the funneling of money to the families of college basketball prospects \xe2\x80\x94 an N.C.A.A. violation that a jury found last year also constituted a felony.'
b'The sentences come ahead of a second trial next month at which more may be revealed about how widespread the rot in recruiting has spread.'
b'James Gatto, the former head of global basketball marketing at Adidas, was sentenced to nine months by U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Merl Code Jr., another former Adidas employee, and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring agent, were given six months each. Code and Dawkins, who are also defendants in next month\xe2\x80\x99s trial, were ordered to pay restitution of a little more than $28,000 each, with Gatto\xe2\x80\x99s amount of restitution still to be determined.'
b'Kaplan ruled that the punishments would not go into effect until the appeal process is completed. The defendants have two weeks to ask the federal circuit court to re-examine the case.'
b'A jury convicted the three men last fall of defrauding the University of Louisville and, in Gatto\xe2\x80\x99s case, also North Carolina State University and the University of Kansas. The men participated in a scheme in which the families of highly rated men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball recruits were offered money in exchange for pledges to play for one of those teams, which are sponsored by Adidas. Prosecutors argued that by unknowingly making the universities vulnerable to N.C.A.A. sanctions, the defendants had victimized the schools.'
b'Such offers are barred by N.C.A.A. rules, which require that college athletes adhere to the association\xe2\x80\x99s policy of amateurism and not be compensated for their participation in their sport beyond a scholarship and related costs of attendance.'
b'Repercussions from the charges brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York have already included the firing of a Hall of Fame coach \xe2\x80\x94 Rick Pitino, formerly of Louisville, who denies wrongdoing and whom prosecutors did not charge. A Kansas player was ruled ineligible early this year after his connection to the scheme came to light.'
b'The lawyers for Code and Dawkins welcomed the sentence.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHappy might be the wrong word, but the judge granted a lenient sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Haney, who represents Dawkins.'
b'Haney also promised that the second trial, which involves alleged bribes to assistant coaches at top men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball programs, would not only exonerate Dawkins but would also show how college basketball business is really done.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to pull back the covers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThis could transform college basketball and put the players in a situation moving forward so they and their labor are treated fairly.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Haney pledged to put coaches on the stand \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cas many as I can get into the courtroom.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Robert S. Khuzami, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in this case, said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cThe sentences imposed today only begin to reflect the magnitude of the harm these defendants caused through a scheme that not only defrauded multiple public universities but upended the lives of young student-athletes and corrupted a game cherished by so many.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing hearing in a packed courtroom on a high floor of the federal district building in downtown Manhattan saw all three defendants as well as their lawyers address the court and plead for leniency. They requested no jail time at all. While most of these statements referred to the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 personal characters, some of the attorneys also pointed to the unusual nature of the case, which depended on a theory in which the universities were victimized by the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to secure them top talent (albeit while putting them at risk of N.C.A.A. penalties).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here as a crime, he would never have done it,\xe2\x80\x9d Code\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Mark Moore, said of his client.'
b'Comparing the situation in the case to a legal principle called the \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine of unclean hands,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore suggested that widespread illicit activity in college recruiting called into question who was truly responsible for the harm his client had purportedly caused.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAdidas has financial contracts with Louisville through which Louisville profited,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not seen Louisville or any of these schools look to get out of their contracts with Adidas\xe2\x80\x9d since the scandal broke in 2017, he added.'
b'Moore noted that although it was not admitted into the record before the jury, Kaplan seemed to recall an earlier scandal at Louisville in which a basketball staffer paid strippers and prostitutes to entertain recruits and players in on-campus housing.'
b'Indeed, Kaplan himself appeared to raise so-called Strippergate, which resulted in N.C.A.A. penalties, during the prosecutor Edward B. Diskant\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the court, in which Diskant insisted that the universities were the victims.'
b'Kaplan said that the defendants had committed \xe2\x80\x9ca serious crime,\xe2\x80\x9d one whose purportedly common nature was not by itself exonerating: \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98everybody\xe2\x80\x99s doing it\xe2\x80\x99 argument, in short, is not a Get Out of Jail Free card,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'But the judge also recognized that the alleged behavior of university employees like assistant coaches and, perhaps, the interests of the universities themselves complicated the theory of the case \xe2\x80\x94 on which a jury convicted \xe2\x80\x94 that the universities were victims.'
b'Referring to Brian \xe2\x80\x9cTugs\xe2\x80\x9d Bowen Jr., a prospect whose father testified that he had indirectly taken from Adidas in exchange for Bowen\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Louisville, Kaplan said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, probably the worst, the most seriously injured victim of the Louisville scheme was Tug Bowen.\xe2\x80\x9d (Bowen was declared ineligible and is now playing professionally in Australia.)'
b'On wiretaps, defendants made oblique references to their activity being typical of high-profile men\xe2\x80\x99s college basketball. They also suggested that at least one of Adidas\xe2\x80\x99s rivals were involved in similar schemes, though there have been no further charges.'
b'Last year Yahoo Sports revealed documents that purported to show the families of several former stars who went on to play for many of the top college basketball programs were on the payroll of Dawkins, the aspiring agent.'
b'The second case, scheduled to be tried next month, initially featured as defendants three former assistant coaches at major programs along with Dawkins and a money manager. The money manager, Munish Sood, reached a deal with prosecutors before the last trial and served as their witness. The three former assistants all pleaded guilty in January, after the guilty verdict in the first case.'
b'A third case, whose trial is scheduled for later thus year, features the former Auburn assistant Chuck Person, who has been charged with bribery.'

b'Good morning,'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99re covering Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s latest rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit deal, Lyft\xe2\x80\x99s public trading debut, and a plastic bag ban in New York State. It\xe2\x80\x99s also Friday, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a new news quiz.'
b'Lawmakers today again refused to endorse Prime Minister Theresa May\xe2\x80\x99s plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union.'
b'After two previous rejections, the vote leaves Mrs. May\xe2\x80\x99s deal in ruins and adds further confusion to the country\xe2\x80\x99s politics, just two weeks before the scheduled departure date.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: The defeat appears to leave the increasingly weakened prime minister with two unpalatable options in the short run: Britain can leave the bloc on April 12 with no deal, a chaotic and potentially economically damaging withdrawal; or Mrs. May can ask European leaders \xe2\x80\x94 who have ruled out a short delay if her plan failed \xe2\x80\x94 for what could be a long postponement.'
b'Shares of Lyft, the ride-hailing company, opened for trading today at $87.24, above the public offering price of $72. At the I.P.O. price, Lyft had a market value of over $24 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: Among those expected to follow in Lyft\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps are its main rival, Uber, as well as the digital pinboard company Pinterest and the messaging platform Slack. Beyond cementing the place of the companies in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, public trading would unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a look at who stands to get rich.'
b'A lawsuit filed on Thursday accused members of the Sackler family, who own the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, of systematic fraud. The suit also includes major pharmaceutical companies that distributed alarming amounts of prescription painkillers during a rising abuse epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S.'
b'The state is seeking, among other goals, to claw back money that it says was transferred from the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma to private or offshore accounts in an effort to shield the assets from litigation.'
b'Response: A spokesman for the Sackler family called the allegations \xe2\x80\x9ca misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. We strongly deny these allegations, which are inconsistent with the factual record, and will vigorously defend against them.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Mr. Trump took particular delight in ridiculing Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, who faced calls from Republicans on Thursday to step down as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. (He didn\xe2\x80\x99t.) '
b'Related: The still-secret report submitted last week by the special counsel was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department has acknowledged. Attorney General William Barr, who released a four-page summary of the report last weekend, has indicated that redacting the report for classified and grand jury information will most likely take weeks.'
b'Closer look: Mr. Trump points with pride to last year\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth and promises even faster growth to come. But economic data suggest that a slowdown is underway.'
b'The Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Command recently outfitted gunships with devices that allow for covert strikes against the Shabab in Somalia. The dispensers can be discreetly fitted onto unarmed surveillance planes, too.'

b'When the left sneaker of college basketball\xe2\x80\x99s biggest star split open on national television Wednesday night 30 seconds into the biggest game of the season, what spilled out was not only his foot but also questions about the future of a marquee player and about the huge influence shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball.'
b'The episode occurred in a game between the archrivals Duke and North Carolina. Zion Williamson, a Duke freshman, pivoted with the ball above the foul line, and the sheer force of his 285-pound frame and acrobatic versatility appeared to cut the shoe almost in two, as though severed by a sharp knife.'
b'Former President Barack Obama, sitting on the sidelines at the Duke arena, was seen on video pointing at Williamson and appearing to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHis shoe broke.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As the scene was replayed on countless highlight shows on Thursday, the damaged shoe threatened to become a nightmare for Nike, which pays tens of millions to elite college sports programs to be the exclusive sponsor for teams and supplier of their footwear.'
b'With his shoe split and his knee sprained, Williamson, an unpaid, budding superstar, sat helpless on the arena floor, staring at the shoe he was wearing in part because of a rich deal between Nike and Duke, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest universities.'
b'Here were all the issues of big-time college sports laid bare: Should amateurism be curbed in college sports, allowing athletes a cut of the money they help produce? Should a prodigious talent like Williamson, who is good enough to play professionally right now, have to risk his future competing for free because of an N.B.A. rule prohibiting him from leaping to the league from high school? Do the sneaker companies, which were at the heart of a federal fraud trial near the start of the season, do more harm than good in college sports?'
b'For a quarter of a century, Nike has been paying Duke tens of millions of dollars to sponsor its teams, and to ensure that its athletes wear only footwear bearing the company\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous logo. The players receive enough shoes to carry them through the season, allowing them to serve largely as free human billboards.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll this does,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabe Feldman, who directs Tulane\xe2\x80\x99s sports law program, said of Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s injury, \xe2\x80\x9cis put a magnifying glass on an issue that has existed for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williamson has not commented.'
b'Nike stock closed down Thursday by 1.05 percent, as the world wondered how a sneaker could split so badly in the middle of a game.'
b'The answer remains a puzzle even to experts. James Gilbert, an orthopedic surgeon who worked with Duke athletics in the 1990s, said he had seen shoes fall apart similarly on soccer players, but never on the hardwood.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a product failure,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilbert said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen that. I had no idea that that happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In a statement Wednesday night, Nike said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery. The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance.\xe2\x80\x9d The statement called the shoe explosion \xe2\x80\x9can isolated occurrence,\xe2\x80\x9d though in 2015, the Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge won the Berlin Marathon even as the insoles of his Nike shoes slipped out of place.'
b'Williamson, who has a mild knee sprain, will probably be sidelined for one to two weeks, and then continue being the favorite to become the No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft in June. By then, he will probably already be a millionaire, because of the endorsement deals he can sign when he ends his college career. For now, he is an N.C.A.A. amateur.'
b'Sneaker companies first became deeply involved with college athletics in the late 1970s, when an enterprising Nike executive, Sonny Vaccaro, arranged for several prominent coaches, such as John Thompson of Georgetown and Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, to receive money in exchange for outfitting their players in the company\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. Starting in the late 1980s, Nike began to sign deals that covered all of a university\xe2\x80\x99s teams.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we see the kids wearing the shoes and selling the product all over the world \xe2\x80\x94 and the kids never got anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Vaccaro, who left Nike years ago, said Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe money has served the same people, except for the most important ones.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A decision in a federal class-action lawsuit challenging N.C.A.A. restrictions on compensation is expected any day.'
b'Standout basketball players were squeezed further in 2006, when the N.B.A. barred talented teenagers from following in the footsteps of Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and LeBron James by entering the league straight out of high school.'
b'Then, in September 2017, federal prosecutors in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Southern District revealed more of the chasm between college basketball players, who can receive only scholarships and related costs of being on campus, and the administrators and coaches who reap the benefits of the revenue the athletes generate for their colleges, conferences and the N.C.A.A. itself. The men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball tournament yields about $1 billion a year for the television rights.'
b'In three complaints filed in United States District Court in New York, prosecutors accused roughly a dozen assistant coaches, middlemen and employees of Adidas of plotting to funnel money to players\xe2\x80\x99 families in exchange for pledges that the athletes, among other things, would play for certain universities and sign with Adidas once they began their pro careers. The scandal led to the firing of a Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino of the University of Louisville, and has netted three convictions, including of Adidas\xe2\x80\x99s former director of global sports marketing.'
b'The transactions outlined by the complaints are practically the modus operandi at many top basketball programs, documents and testimony in the legal case suggested. Wiretaps revealed suspects describing at least one Adidas rival engaging in similar practices. Documents from the case reported by Yahoo Sports last year indicated that former top players at dozens of prominent programs \xe2\x80\x94 including Duke \xe2\x80\x94 had been on the payroll of an aspiring agent who has since been convicted of fraud.'
b'Duke did not reply to requests for comment Thursday.'
b'The specifics of Duke\xe2\x80\x99s deal with Nike, which the two sides have extended through 2027, are not publicly known. As a private university, Duke is not obligated to reveal the terms.'
b'But a look at Nike deals with similar universities that are public offer some indication of how the contracts work.'
b'Nike\xe2\x80\x99s deal with North Carolina, for instance, will give the university more than $90 million in cash and merchandise over 10 years. Nike also signed personal contracts with a number of North Carolina coaches: Roy Williams, the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach, will receive an average of $300,000 a year over the life of the 10-year agreement.'
b'Contracts generally state that Nike is not liable for injuries suffered by athletes wearing its products. The contracts also require every player to wear the company\xe2\x80\x99s shoes unless a medical condition makes Nike footwear unsuitable. A player might, as stipulated in Nike\xe2\x80\x99s deal with the University of Michigan, be required to make himself available for examination by Nike or a local podiatrist before using a shoe made by another company.'
b'It is not known why Williamson wore the particular Nike model that tore on Wednesday. It was a Nike \xe2\x80\x9csignature shoe,\xe2\x80\x9d a term for a style endorsed by a specific athlete \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, the N.B.A. star Paul George, who plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder.'
b'What makes Williamson so compelling is the same thing that might make a shoe unable to contain him. He combines size and speed with strength and agility in the manner of James, who during a day off this month went to Charlottesville, Va., to see Williamson and the Blue Devils take on Virginia. Though Williamson weighs 285 pounds, at times he seems like the fastest player on the court.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with some of these athletes who are getting quicker, stronger, faster, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to consider some of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilbert, the orthopedist.'

b'Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. should recognize Israel\xe2\x80\x99s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights, overturning decades of American policy in the Middle East.'
b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on Twitter came after persistent pressure from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an ally who is fighting for his political life with an election scheduled for next month. While popular in Israel and among some U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else. '
b'Catch up: The United Nations has rejected Israel\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967, when Israeli troops seized the 400 square miles from Syria during the Arab-Israeli War. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a brief history of the dispute. '
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: Practically speaking, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s announcement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change much, as the status of the Golan Heights is not under negotiation, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no expectation that Israel will withdraw. But symbolically, the decision shakes up a debate that has changed little since the 1970s.'
b'European Union officials agreed on Thursday to extend the deadline for Britain\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the bloc until May 22, as long as Prime Minister Theresa May can persuade Parliament to accept her plan for doing so. If she can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 and lawmakers have already rejected her proposal twice \xe2\x80\x94 the deadline would be moved up to April 12.'
b'The agreement effectively averted a disorderly and chaotic departure at the end of next week, yet such a break remains a possibility.'
b'What\xe2\x80\x99s next: Neither side wants Britain to leave without a deal. European Union officials said they remained open to a longer delay but that it would require Britain to participate in European Parliament elections \xe2\x80\x94 something that Mrs. May has said would be an absurdity.'
b'A week after the terrorist attack on two mosques that left 50 people dead, mourners from around the world gathered in Christchurch, New Zealand, today to share the Muslim call to prayer and two minutes of silence.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart \xe2\x80\x94 but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque, one of the two attacked.'
b'Related: In addition to announcing a ban on the type of weapons used in the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has pledged to hold social media companies accountable for letting hateful speech thrive on their platforms. As of Thursday, at least two people have been charged in New Zealand with spreading the killer\xe2\x80\x99s video of part of the attack.'
b'The Daily: Today\xe2\x80\x99s episode is about the speed with which New Zealand planned changes to its gun laws after the attack.'
b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s national airline said today that it had asked to cancel an order of 737 Max 8 jets. It is the first publicly confirmed attempt to stop a deal since the planes were involved in two deadly crashes. '
b'A spokesman for the carrier, Garuda Indonesia, said that its passengers had lost confidence in the model. But he acknowledged that it would be difficult to cancel a signed agreement.'
b'Garuda\xe2\x80\x99s deal was for 49 planes, and estimated to be worth $4.9 billion. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.'
b'Another angle: Relatives of those killed when another airline\xe2\x80\x99s Max 8 crashed in Indonesia say the airline tried to buy their silence with a deal that would also protect Boeing.'
b'Small countries, corporations and wealthy individuals have a new weapon at their disposal: privatized spying through companies that hire former intelligence operatives. '
b'A monthslong Times investigation found that the firms have enabled governments to hack not only terrorist groups and drug cartels, but also activists and journalists. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has used the Israeli firm NSO, pictured above, to track dissidents. '
b'U.S. casualties in Afghanistan: Two U.S. service members were killed in northern Afghanistan today, bringing to four the American combat deaths in the country this year, Afghan and American officials said.'
b'Cyclone\xe2\x80\x99s aftermath: As floodwaters receded in Mozambique, people with very little before the storm found that they had even less. Here\xe2\x80\x99s information about how to help people in southern Africa.'
b'U.S. flood warning: Nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states will have an elevated risk of flooding until May, federal scientists have said. The Midwest has already confronted record-breaking late-winter floods. '
b'Deadly blast in China: An explosion that killed at least 47 people at a chemical factory has raised fears of poisons spreading in the air and water.'
b'Free speech on campus: President Trump has signed an executive order that links some higher education funds to how colleges enforce speech rights, a move endorsed by conservatives who say their voices have been silenced.'
b'Perspective: In an Op-Ed, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, discusses what he would like to see in the special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s report.'
b'Snapshot: Above, Holi celebrations in Amritsar, India, on Thursday. The Hindu festival marks the arrival of spring.'
b'N.C.A.A. basketball: Day 1 of the men\xe2\x80\x99s tournament had scares but no dramatic upsets. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the schedule for Day 2, as well as a look at the women\xe2\x80\x99s tournament, which starts today.'
b'News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.'
b'Modern Love: In this week\xe2\x80\x99s column, a woman wonders if traditional romance is a trap, and finds that the ordinary is the most romantic gesture of all.'
b'Late-night comedy: Seth Meyers is getting impatient for a certain former vice president to announce he\xe2\x80\x99s running for president: \xe2\x80\x9cJoe Biden is the kid you played hide and seek with who would hide behind a sheer curtain. We see you.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'What we\xe2\x80\x99re reading: This essay in The New Yorker. Alisha Haridasani Gupta, a member of the briefings team, says: \xe2\x80\x9cEmilia Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen, one of the strongest, most compelling characters in the \xe2\x80\x98Game of Thrones\xe2\x80\x99 series. Here, she reveals how through most of that era, she was struggling offscreen with near-death experiences from two aneurysms.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Cook: Drizzle tahini dressing on a bread salad with roasted squash. '
b'Listen: Holly Herndon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEternal\xe2\x80\x9d is as propulsive as it is disorienting, writes Jon Pareles.'
b'Watch: We have ideas on what to stream based on how much time you have. '
b'Go: Martinique offers Caribbean warmth with French accents. '
b'Smarter Living: After one of our reporters described a week of plastic-free shopping, readers wrote in with more tips: reuse rather than toss plastic cutlery, keep a coffee mug and a water bottle at your desk, and find new uses for yogurt containers, like painting or composting.'
b'We also have a checklist to help you avoid screen-share disasters, and the cautionary tale of an extreme example.'
b'What do lichens and politics have in common?'
b'As you may remember from chemistry class, a litmus test determines a solution\xe2\x80\x99s relative acidity. But the phrase is also used metaphorically to refer to a character-defining political issue, and it has been popping up in coverage of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.'
b'The chemical test, in use since the Middle Ages, employs a dye derived from lichens to determine whether a solution is more acidic or alkaline.'
b'The political application of the phrase appeared in The Times at least as early as 1950, when it described NATO and the Marshall Plan as \xe2\x80\x9cthe litmus test for distinguishing between Communists and supporters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'This year, \xe2\x80\x9clitmus test\xe2\x80\x9d has appeared in The Times to refer to marijuana legalization, the proposed border wall and universal health care.'
b'This week is the Times Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s special Voyages Issue, featuring the travel guru Rick Steves, who wants to set you free.'
b'Enjoy the weekend. See you next time.'

b'THE FALCONER By Dana Czapnik 278 pp. Atria Books. $25.'
b'Toward the end of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Falconer,\xe2\x80\x9d Dana Czapnik\xe2\x80\x99s electric debut novel, 17-year-old Lucy Adler looks up from Simone de Beauvoir\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Second Sex\xe2\x80\x9d at the Japanese maple on her Upper West Side neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s terrace. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to read the passage and not think of beloved Francie Nolan peering out another window in another New York City borough, almost 100 years earlier. Yet whereas in \xe2\x80\x9cA Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\xe2\x80\x9d both Francie and the Tree of Heaven grow up amid an unforgiving, concrete urban setting, Czapnik\xe2\x80\x99s maple has been coaxed and cared for, its leaves treated with a protective coating. Lucy, a middle-class Manhattanite attending an elite private school, has battled none of the Nolan family\xe2\x80\x99s hardships, nor is she plagued by the acerbic ennui that Holden Caulfield gave voice to in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Catcher in the Rye,\xe2\x80\x9d but comparisons to both classic New York bildungsromans nonetheless seem inevitable. That is, until you realize that what binds them \xe2\x80\x94 all tell of a determinedly independent young hero\xe2\x80\x99s quest for selfhood catalyzed by the crucible of New York City \xe2\x80\x94 is also what makes them so resistant to comparison. Like Francie and Holden before her, Lucy, a street-smart, superlative basketballer vulnerable to the perils of approaching womanhood, is too carefully drawn to be equated with anyone else.'
b'Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s fierce first-person point of view is as confident and fearless as she is on the court; she narrates her story with the immediacy and sharpness of a sports commentator, mixed with the pathos and wisdom of a perceptive adolescent charting the perils of her senior year of high school. A self-described \xe2\x80\x9cpizza bagel \xe2\x80\x94 a Jewish and Italian mutt-girl,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy grapples with the rigid expectations of others, especially her harshly critical high school peers who have rendered her an outcast. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it just so much easier for everybody when a girl fits into a nice little girl category \xe2\x80\x94 good girl slut tomboy girly girl smart girl ditz \xe2\x80\x94 instead of being a fully fleshed-out person who is in constant conversation \xe2\x80\xa6 with all the various fractious parts of herself,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy wisely observes. We watch that conversation unfold in real time through her adventures with her best friend, Alexis, a tough-talking Dominican sage tethered to Lucy through basketball and their shared outsider status; Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s forays into the navel-gazing Downtown arts scene of her painter cousin, Violet; and, most pulverizing, her unrequited love for her emotionally unavailable scrimmage partner Percy, a self-proclaimed nihilist from a neglected but moneyed family who goes through girlfriends like Kleenex and is referred to by friends as the \xe2\x80\x9cVirgin Surgeon.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s arguably the nonhuman characters that give true shape to Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s evolution: basketball and New York. (The novel\xe2\x80\x99s opening line, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball is a face,\xe2\x80\x9d confirms the game\xe2\x80\x99s significance and anthropomorphism for her.) Only with ball in hand does Lucy feel invincible and most herself, even as that self changes: \xe2\x80\x9cI ought not to imbue a ball with so much magic, but when I\xe2\x80\x99m holding one I go from Lucy Adler, invisible girl \xe2\x80\xa6 to Lucy Adler, Warrior Goddess.\xe2\x80\x9d Her self-descriptions on the court are as visceral and vivid as any sex scene, and when the actual sex scene does eventually unfold it is against the backdrop of a Rangers game on television, the commentators\xe2\x80\x99 play-by-play mirroring Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s own disembodied narration of her experience.'
b'The basketball grows into a metaphor for the universe: \xe2\x80\x9cI bounce the world hard on the blacktop, and it comes back into my hand covered with a fine layer of New York City diamond dust.\xe2\x80\x9d The entire novel is indeed cloaked in just such a glimmering film, and Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s love-hate relationship with her roiling city reflects her changeable hopes for herself and others. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess New York is like that, in that what you mistake it for matters as much as what it actually is.\xe2\x80\x9d Czapnik, who herself grew up in Manhattan around the same time as Lucy, captures nostalgia \xe2\x80\x94 for both a vanishing New York and Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s evaporating childhood \xe2\x80\x94 with the lucidity of a V.R. headset. The early-90s era seems unremarkable to the characters in the thick of it \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWe live in \xe2\x80\xa6 insignificant times,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy says between hits of a joint \xe2\x80\x94 but feels poignantly pre-9/11 to today\xe2\x80\x99s reader.'
b'Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s coming-of-age is tempered by her constant brush-ups against the constrictions society places on her sex. Happening upon \xe2\x80\x9cThe Falconer,\xe2\x80\x9d a bronze of a boy in Elizabethan dress releasing a falcon in Central Park, Lucy is envious that statues of boys depict them in action poses while women are either demure nudes or Alice in Wonderland. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish they made statues of girls like that?\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy asks Alexis. \xe2\x80\x9cJust some girl having unapologetic fun.\xe2\x80\x9d Alexis replies: \xe2\x80\x9cI never apologize for the fun I have. And neither do you.\xe2\x80\x9d Reader, beware: Spending time with Lucy is unapologetic fun, and heartbreak, and awe as well.'

b'BUIES CREEK, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 With three seconds left in the first half last Wednesday night, Campbell point guard Chris Clemons was fouled on a layup. He banged the floor in frustration as the ball rimmed out, then rose and hit both free throws. Someone in the sparsely populated stands yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations, Chris!\xe2\x80\x9d Given the size of the crowd, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certain Clemons heard him.'
b'The second free throw was Clemons\xe2\x80\x99s 22nd point of the night, and the 2,952nd of his four-season career at Campbell, a private university about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s drive south of Raleigh, N.C., his hometown. It also meant Clemons, a senior, had entered the top 10 of the men\xe2\x80\x99s Division I college basketball career scoring list, passing the former Kansas star Danny Manning. By the end of the game, when Clemons had finished off a season-high 48-point effort, he had passed Oscar Robertson, too.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a gift and a curse that you\xe2\x80\x99re not really able to enjoy the moment \xe2\x80\x94 or that I chose not to, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d Clemons said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do understand the significance of the events.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'History is being made in college basketball this season, but not all of it is being made for teams that are likely bound for the Final Four or by players who are projected to be selected early in the next N.B.A. draft.'
b'With 3,006 career points at Campbell, Clemons is two behind Hersey Hawkins, the former Bradley player, for eighth all time, heading into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game with High Point. At South Dakota State, another senior, Mike Daum, is poised to break into the top 10 by season\xe2\x80\x99s end; with 2,943 points, he could pass Manning in the Jackrabbits\xe2\x80\x99 game on Thursday against Fort Wayne.'
b'It is an unignorable fact that most of the players still ahead of Clemons and Daum on the career scoring list are not household names, either. After Hawkins, for instance, Clemons could pass Keydren Clark, who played for St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s, in Jersey City; Harry Kelly of Texas Southern, in Houston; and perhaps even Alphonso Ford of Mississippi Valley State, who holds fourth place with 3,165 points. (First place, by a country mile, with 3,667 points, is the Louisiana State legend Pete Maravich, even though he played only three seasons.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI recognize that a lot of people on that list, who scored a lot of points in college, didn\xe2\x80\x99t go on to have successful N.B.A. careers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins, who did have a successful N.B.A. career and now works for the Portland Trail Blazers.'
b'Freeman Williams \xe2\x80\x94 who is second, and the scorer of 3,249 points for Portland State \xe2\x80\x94 acknowledged that his college years had been his glory days. \xe2\x80\x9cI got most of my attention as a basketball player back then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Clemons and Daum fit in the same category. Daum is a two-time (and probable three-time) Summit League player of the year. Clemons is leading all Division I players in scoring this season, averaging nearly 30 points a game. Although both are likely to get opportunities to shine during the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s summer league or on its development league rosters, said Fran Fraschilla, the former coach and ESPN draft analyst, the 6-foot 9-inch Daum is at best a late-second-round draft pick. Clemons, who is listed at 5-9, is unlikely to be drafted at all.'
b'The relative anonymity of college basketball\xe2\x80\x99s leading career scorers appears to be a feature, not a bug. If you are scoring so many points for so much time, you most likely are not doing so at college basketball\xe2\x80\x99s heights.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mike Daum or Chris Clemons had gone to play in the Big Ten or the A.C.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d Fraschilla said last week, referring to the Atlantic Coast Conference, \xe2\x80\x9cthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be on the verge of scoring 3,000 points.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added, \xe2\x80\x9cAs good players as they are, they would be on teams with other really talented players, as opposed to going to a school like S.D.S.U. or Campbell, where virtually from Day 1 their talent was such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their league.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And had they dominated as they have in a bigger league, they probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be seniors; the best college basketball players are around for only one or two seasons.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lionel Simmons, who is third with 3,217 career points for La Salle. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of these players, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come out early, they could have scored 3,000.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But even when top talents played for three or four college seasons, they did so for top teams whose other talented players lowered the individual demands on them. Superlative college players like U.C.L.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Georgetown\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick Ewing had the kinds of supporting casts that come with championship teams.'
b'The most prominent name in the top 20, after Robertson, is Larry Bird, who played most of his college career at Indiana State, a team that he led to the Final Four, but one that needed him to average 30 points a game. But a place on the list can still be a point of pride years later.'
b'Hawkins acknowledged that he kept tabs on developments in the career scoring top 10. In 2014, a Blazers scout was at the Creighton game in which Doug McDermott, now of the Indiana Pacers, passed Hawkins. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was texting me, \xe2\x80\x98Six points away,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Two points away,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Hawkins said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought it was funny. I was sitting at dinner getting texted every three minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Last week, Clemons deflected postgame questions about passing Manning and Robertson, saying he was focused on this season, in which the Fighting Camels (15-11) are third in the Big South. Asked whether he had kept the game ball, he laughed; of course he had not.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter it\xe2\x80\x99s all said and done, I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely go back and look, reminisce on the years I\xe2\x80\x99ve had here, kind of be amazed at myself, know what I was able to accomplish,\xe2\x80\x9d Clemons said.'
b'Like Clemons, Daum emphasized in a telephone interview that he has been putting his team first. Still, he said, he could not help noticing recently when he passed Bird, as well as Duke\xe2\x80\x99s J. J. Redick and North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Tyler Hansbrough, two stars from the last decade whom Daum had grown up watching.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m going to look back on it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his eventual scoring total \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe when I\xe2\x80\x99m older, and be like, \xe2\x80\x98See how cool it was to be in that position,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Daum said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me personally,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s just getting ready for the next thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Fans tuning in to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s marquee matchup between Duke and Virginia waited less than two minutes before getting what they came for. On an early Virginia possession, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Zion Williamson, the impossible freshman who moves with a guard\xe2\x80\x99s agility while weighing 280 pounds, recovered a loose ball and hammered down a two-handed dunk with Old Testament fury.'
b'Williamson is expected to be the top pick in this year\xe2\x80\x99s N.B.A. draft and has been this season\xe2\x80\x99s signature player \xe2\x80\x94 a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slams that a rare missed dunk last week against Boston College became a highlight in its own right.'
b'The only other player who has come close to capturing the collective imagination as Williamson is Murray State\xe2\x80\x99s Ja Morant, a 6-foot-3 sophomore who has played his way from virtual anonymity to likely top-five draft position on a diet of Jordan-esque leaping, flying slams.'
b'That Williamson and Morant are this season\xe2\x80\x99s college basketball folk heroes is in one sense entirely logical. Dunks are popular, they dunk well, therefore they are popular.'
b'Yet in the context of recent history and current basketball trends, they are outliers as stars because they are relatively poor shooters from long distance.'
b'Neither player can efficiently utilize the 3-pointer, which has cemented itself as the most treasured tool in the modern offensive game. Williamson has made less than 30 percent of the 47 3-pointers he has attempted. Morant is at 32.7 percent, below the Division I average of 34.3 percent.'
b'Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward the 3-pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shots, but by his sensational block of De\xe2\x80\x99Andre Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s ill-fated attempt late in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, an 81-71 Duke victory.'
b'Their proficiency in dunking over long-distance shooting signals how special they are, of course, but also might herald a market correction in which basketball\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable shot is back in.'
b'In recent seasons, the defining players \xe2\x80\x94 the ones who made the biggest impacts and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist \xe2\x80\x94 have overwhelmingly been sharpshooters. Think of Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s Trae Young and Buddy Hield, Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 Frank Mason III, Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s Yogi Ferrell, Purdue\xe2\x80\x99s Caleb Swanigan and even Duke\xe2\x80\x99s infamous Grayson Allen. The last 7-footer to be named player of the year, Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Frank Kaminsky, was not a high-volume shooter of 3s, but he made 41.6 percent of his attempts in his Wooden Award-winning season. Villanova won a title at the buzzer when Kris Jenkins hit a 3.'
b'Yet this year\xe2\x80\x99s watch list for the Wooden Award includes Williamson and Morant along with other poor-shooting yet exciting non-big men like Duke\xe2\x80\x99s R.J. Barrett and Tennessee\xe2\x80\x99s Grant Williams. Marquette\xe2\x80\x99s Markus Howard has received comparatively little attention as this year\xe2\x80\x99s exemplary high-volume, high-accuracy distance shooter.'
b'The ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said dunks were emerging as more crucial to offenses because so-called midrange shots \xe2\x80\x94 2-point attempts that are not from close in near the basket \xe2\x80\x94 have been so devalued by analytics. Get to the rim. Get fouled. Or take a 3. Those are the modern basketball credos.'
b'Bilas said it was possible that, after several years in which the 3-pointer has predominated in top offenses, coaches have improved at devising defenses to stymie perimeter shooting \xe2\x80\x94 in that way placing a premium on wing players who excel at close range. But mainly Williamson and Morant stand out because they are standouts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re seeing more dunks because there are more spectacular athletes out there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of guys can dunk, but he dunks on the way up,\xe2\x80\x9d he added of Williamson. \xe2\x80\x9cHis head is literally at or over the rim every time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Recent seasons\xe2\x80\x99 emphasis on the 3 was easy to understand if you looked to the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the 3-pointer\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency. The Golden State Warriors emerged as a dynasty thanks in part to their high-volume 3-point shooting, and even they have been surpassed by teams like the Houston Rockets who attempt 3s at record numbers while confining their other shots to the restricted area under the basket.'
b'Meanwhile, the trey picked up a cachet that had previously been reserved only for the jam. Players who sank one from deep mimicked bow-and-arrow shots toward their benches, igniting their teammates; Stephen Curry, Hield and Young became the players youngsters aspired to play like.'
b'And to be sure, 3-pointers have not gone away. This season they account for nearly a third of the points scored in Division I, according to KenPom.com, the highest ever and part of a steady upward trajectory. Teams are making 34.3 percent of attempts, which is just a few fractions of a percent off the past couple years\xe2\x80\x99 heights.'
b'What have positively plummeted are, as Bilas suggested, midrange attempts. According to Ken Pomeroy, KenPom.com\xe2\x80\x99s proprietor, midrange shots \xe2\x80\x94 defined essentially as 2-point attempts beyond a couple feet from the basket \xe2\x80\x94 account for barely a quarter of total field goal attempts this season. That figure was 33 percent as recently as the 2012-13 season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe 15- to 20-footers are becoming extinct,\xe2\x80\x9d Pomeroy said in an interview.'
b'With players setting up farther from the basket, the dunk opportunity has opened perhaps more than ever before. And into that breach have stepped an uncommonly talented crop of dunkers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best dunking college basketball has seen in a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chuck Millan, a dunk coach involved not only with high schoolers but with the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s dunk contest, which will be staged Saturday night.'
b'Millan highlighted lesser known players with sensational abilities, including Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s Kwintin Williams, Florida Gulf Coast\xe2\x80\x99s Troy Baxter and Arkansas-Little Rock\xe2\x80\x99s Rayjon Tucker \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ca freak of nature,\xe2\x80\x9d as Millan put it.'
b'As for Williamson and Morant, Millan said that, as with chocolate and vanilla, a comparison comes down to personal preference \xe2\x80\x94 although he may ultimately fall on Team Zion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith Ja, it\xe2\x80\x99s the dunks in traffic, because he\xe2\x80\x99s little, and the body contact he takes,\xe2\x80\x9d Millan said. \xe2\x80\x9cZion, being 6-8, 280, seeing him be just so agile and almost ballerina-like, being such a huge dude \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s more impressive.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Colleen and Lauren Mullen, who rose through the coaching ranks and married, have a girl and twin boys. For now, Colleen is on the sideline and Lauren is cheering and child-watching.'
b'By Kevin Armstrong'
b'ALBANY \xe2\x80\x94 Lauren Mullen pulled her black hat low over her eyes, paid $10 for a ticket and entered Sefcu Arena just before tip-off recently. She sat in Section 150. There were 18 rows between her and any other fans. She trained her focus on the two head coaches.'
b'On the visiting bench sat the University of Massachusetts, Lowell coach, Tom Garrick, a former N.B.A. player. Last spring, Mullen, then the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at New York University, interviewed for the position that Garrick now holds. It was the third time in four years that she had been a finalist for a Division I head-coaching job. Her r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 included a 103-58 record and five postseason berths with the Violets.'
b'On the home sideline stood Mullen\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Colleen, the coach of SUNY Albany. Colleen got the job one month after Lauren lost out to Garrick. An associate coach at West Point for six years, Colleen reached the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament twice. When Albany hired Colleen, Lauren resigned from N.Y.U. to stay at home with their children: Maggie, 3, and their 1-year-old twins, Brennan and Callan.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you think about it, if I had gotten the Lowell job, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve been over there,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren said, pointing to Garrick. And Colleen, she added, would have been with the children. \xe2\x80\x9cCrazy, just crazy,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 she said.'
b'It is, though, the path they are taking as a same-sex coaching couple with three small children and all sorts of demands and challenges. '
b'Indeed, Colleen joined a small sorority when Albany hired her. Although the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage three years ago and college campuses can be among the more progressive places in the United States, Colleen says she is one of only five women she knows of who are openly gay head coaches in college basketball. She recalled how Sue Johnson, her coach at the University of New Hampshire at the time who is now the athletic director at Concord Academy in Massachusetts, came out 16 years ago, when Colleen was a senior. At the time, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s longtime partner, Kelly, was pregnant, and Johnson informed the team of their relationship after a practice.'
b'It was the chaos familiar to a lot of dual-income households that led Lauren and Colleen to a crossroads last winter. After four years of matching basketball calendars to Colleen\xe2\x80\x99s biological clock to plan births for the off-season, timing recruiting calls around nap schedules, and wrestling with nanny problems and a merry-go-round of fill-in babysitters, they needed a change. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe were at a breaking point,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of coming and going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolute insanity,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be frank, at the end of last year, it was like, \xe2\x80\x98O.K., what are we going to do?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Both 38, the Mullens knew one of them needed to get a Division I head coaching job so the other could afford to step back into a supporting role. '
b'A pact was made early on. They would not pursue the same jobs, though they had competed for employment once before. '
b'That occurred when they met, in 2007. At the time, Lauren was a graduate assistant at Lehigh. There was an opening for an assistant coaching position, and Lauren applied for the internal promotion. Colleen, then an assistant at Southern New Hampshire University, also applied. They possessed similar credentials. Colleen stood 5 feet 2 inches and had starred at the University of New Hampshire as a pass-first point guard. Lauren was 5-foot-4, and was a facilitator at Hofstra. Colleen, who is six months older, got the job. '
b'Soon after, they played one-on-one for the first and only time. Lauren beat Colleen. Any lingering tension turned to mutual interest. On opening day of practice that season, they went on their first date.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t hate me for that long,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe got a master\xe2\x80\x99s from Lehigh. She\xe2\x80\x99s in good shape.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Early in their relationship, they visited Colleen\xe2\x80\x99s family. While there, they realized they had played in the same Florida tournament when they were 13. Colleen found a photo that captured Lauren guarding her on an inbounds play.'
b'They kept their relationship quiet as they began to climb the coaching ladder, drawing interest from South Carolina to Connecticut. Once, while Colleen was at Long Island University and Lauren was at Sacred Heart in Connecticut, they were in the same conference. L.I.U. beat Sacred Heart both times they played.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI slept on the couch,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s lying,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe would have made me sleep on the couch. Takes her a little time to let the steam off.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Colleen went north to West Point to become an assistant coach in June 2011. Weeks later, President Obama ended the United States military\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d policy, the 17-year-old law that banned openly gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from military service. Colleen then found herself in competition with Lauren once more, this time for a recruit. Her name was Kelsey Minato, from Huntington Beach, Calif. '
b'Minato was a prolific outside scorer and Lauren was the first to reach out to her. She and Colleen had sat side-by-side in the stands watching Minato at a tournament in Arizona, and Colleen encouraged Lauren to speak with Minato\xe2\x80\x99s coach afterward. Lauren followed through. '
b'A few weeks later, Army realized it needed a guard, and Colleen asked Lauren whether she would mind if Army pursued Minato. Lauren welcomed the competition. Minato was unaware of the relationship between the recruiters, and narrowed her choices to Sacred Heart and Army. She eventually became the best player in Army history, scoring 49 points in one game, breaking records and having her No. 5 jersey retired.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ride that wave for a long time, have a nice halo around my head for finding her,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said.'
b'But it was Lauren who became a head coach first. That summer, she signed on to lead N.Y.U. While Colleen sold recruits on West Point\xe2\x80\x99s structure, Lauren pitched West Fourth Street\xe2\x80\x99s freedom. One day, Lauren announced that practice was canceled. In came the West Point women in camouflage gear for a boot camp.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy players were all like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted no part.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99'
b'In any case, wins at both programs followed, along with a wedding in May 2014. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew experience for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dave Magarity, the head coach of the West Point women\xe2\x80\x99s team. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of cigars floating around.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Mullens were living in Ossining, N.Y. \xe2\x80\x94 26 miles from West Point, 36 miles from Greenwich Village. And Colleen, known as The Mullenator at West Point, recalled that Magarity defended her sexual orientation. When a recruit\xe2\x80\x99s parent asked which members of his staff were married, Magarity said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ever ask that question again.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDave was like papa bear,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said.'
b'Last May, Albany, which has reached six of the last seven N.C.A.A. tournaments, hired Colleen as its head coach. After starting 1-9, the Great Danes have gone 10-5 and are tied for third place in the America East.'
b'As a head coach, Colleen, who has been openly gay since college, now finds herself calculating when to mention Lauren, who came out when she was in her mid-20s. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am talking to certain people, and I bring up my wife, there\xe2\x80\x99s a second thought in my head,\xe2\x80\x9d Colleen said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Should I just talk about my kids?\xe2\x80\x99 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right when you censor yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Up in the stands, it has not taken long for Lauren to find her voice as a spectator. When the season schedule was announced, she cleared her calendar to be in attendance at Albany\xe2\x80\x99s opener at the University of South Florida. She had not been able to make one of Colleen\xe2\x80\x99s games in years. In the stands, Lauren described herself as \xe2\x80\x9cout of control.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Lauren said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was like, I need to calm down, but then I\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a walk! They walked!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'She and Colleen bought a house in Bethlehem, N.Y., last August. On a recent night there, Maggie played with Disney princess stamps as Lauren cut chicken nuggets for the boys. A chalkboard featured a to-do list above a diagram of \xe2\x80\x9cDouble Horns,\xe2\x80\x9d an offensive set.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re like a sociology experiment because Maggie wants gowns and she\xe2\x80\x99d maybe seen her moms in like 10 dresses combined,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren said. The boys, she added, had all girls toys to choose from but are indicating an interest in trucks.'
b'And Maggie is learning what comes with winning. After a victory over the University of Maryland Baltimore County, the Great Danes awaited Colleen in the home locker room. Maggie was hesitant to go inside, so Lauren let her know that she would be waiting in the hallway. After Maggie and Colleen entered, the door closed behind them. A roar could be heard as guard Kyara Frames lifted Colleen in the air, per their celebratory custom. Eleven seconds later, Maggie ran out crying.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMom\xe2\x80\x99s having fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Lauren told her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe girls are having fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The University of North Carolina has put the staff of its women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team on indefinite leave pending an investigation into the program.'
b'In a statement, the university said the investigation was prompted by \xe2\x80\x9cissues raised by student-athletes and others.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A Charlotte law firm will review the program. The head coach, Sylvia Hatchell, and her three assistants will be paid during the investigation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I will cooperate fully in this review,\xe2\x80\x9d Hatchell said in a statement Monday, after the university announced its decision. \xe2\x80\x9cI look forward to a prompt conclusion of this matter and the continuation of our very successful women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball program.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hatchell, who has coached the team since 1986, is in the basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. She won the national championship in 1994 and made two other Final Fours.'
b'Several highly touted players have transferred away from North Carolina in recent years, notably Diamond DeShields, who despite a strong freshman year on court moved on to Tennessee and then the W.N.B.A.'
b'Hatchell, 67, was found to have leukemia in 2013, but after treatment returned to the team.'
b'This season North Carolina was 18-15 and returned for the first time in four years to the N.C.A.A. tournament, where it lost in the first round.'
b'But her tenure recently has been rocky. Most notably, the team was at the center of an N.C.A.A. investigation into fake African Studies classes largely populated by athletes who got high grades for little, if any, work.'
b'Many of the accusations in the case focused on Jan Boxill, an academic adviser to the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team, who was said to have improperly helped players academically and steered them to the bogus courses. She eventually resigned from the university.'
b'The N.C.A.A. eventually ruled that the team would receive no penalties because the classes were also available to nonathletes.'
b'The university has not elaborated on the nature of the complaints that prompted the new investigation.'

b'For Arike Ogunbowale, the trip to the top of the Empire State Building on Wednesday was unusually fast.'
b'It had been arranged for her to bypass the lines and take express elevators to the observatory on the morning she was to become a professional basketball player. In the hours leading to the 2019 W.N.B.A. draft, these kinds of experiences did not faze Ogunbowale. Not after she had become one of the most recognizable faces in college basketball after hitting a pair of buzzer-beaters for Notre Dame in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Final Four \xe2\x80\x94 one to slay Connecticut, the other to best Mississippi State and win the national championship.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNah, I\xe2\x80\x99m used to life throwing new things at me now,\xe2\x80\x9d Ogunbowale said with a smile as she looked out over the New York skyline.'
b'Even for the relentless Ogunbowale, the past week has brought a particular kind of whiplash.'
b'On Wednesday night, the Dallas Wings selected her fifth in the draft, after the Las Vegas Aces took her college teammate Jackie Young with the top pick.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Dallas is a great place, and they have a great coach there, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really excited,\xe2\x80\x9d Ogunbowale said, referring to Brian Agler, who has won the league title with teams in Seattle and Los Angeles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to get started.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The draft followed her vintage set of performances in this season\xe2\x80\x99s Final Four: 23 points in another win over Connecticut, and a game-high 31 points in the national title game against Baylor. Ogunbowale\xe2\x80\x99s final shots came after a drive to the basket that yielded two free throws in the waning seconds, her team trailing by 2 points.'
b'Then, the unthinkable: a miss. And a championship lost. Ogunbowale\xe2\x80\x99s painful moment played out on the national stage, too, amplified in part by her previous success. Her mother, Yolanda, raced down from the stands after the game to reassure her, to say how proud she was.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOver time, she\xe2\x80\x99s going to realize that she won\xe2\x80\x99t be defined by that moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Yolanda said Wednesday, hours before her daughter would hear her name called at the W.N.B.A. draft at Nike\xe2\x80\x99s New York headquarters. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just hurting for her, and for her teammates, because they wanted it so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And there would be no time to process. A late Sunday night game turned into a Monday morning flight to South Bend, Ind., where Ogunbowale has one more class to complete at Notre Dame before she graduates.'
b'Then it was onto New York, to see the realization of a professional dream that dates back to high school in Wisconsin, though first Ogunbowale had to choose basketball over soccer. (Oddly enough, Baylor recruited her for soccer.) She and her mother both say she could have gone pro in that, too. Confidence, backed up by results, runs in the family.'
b'The path Ogunbowale chose has worked out pretty well. Over these last few days, her strength and her network of fans have fed off each other. Yolanda said Arike\xe2\x80\x99s bubbly personality had drawn people into her orbit since she was a little girl.'
b'Fans recognized her at the airport as she headed back to school, and some approached to cheer her up. People took notice, too, up on the Empire State Building observation deck. For Ogunbowale, it is becoming clearer that everyone still sees in her that dynamic personality, that same person who hit buzzer-beaters, who scored 55 in a high school game, who can count LeBron James and Kobe Bryant among her fans.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKobe, LeBron, all of them, they\xe2\x80\x99ve missed some important shots in their lifetime,\xe2\x80\x9d Ogunbowale said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the game, you know? I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to make every shot. So I\xe2\x80\x99m glad about my career, and I think I had a great four years. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s been telling me that. I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just one shot. But what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done these four years for the program, for just women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball in general, is big.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'How big? After the loss, Bryant reached out directly to encourage her. There seems to be something about Ogunbowale that make people root for her (unless they are part of the Connecticut faithful, that is).'
b'And as her mother explained, Ogunbowale engenders a two-way connection, something of particular import for W.N.B.A. teams hoping to win both on the court and at the box office.'
b'Liamani Segura, the 10-year-old girl who sang the national anthem at the title game, wanted a picture with Ogunbowale. Segura\xe2\x80\x99s father worried Ogunbowale wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to take one after such a difficult loss. But, as Segura\xe2\x80\x99s father later told Yolanda, Arike approached Segura on her own for that photograph.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of person she is,\xe2\x80\x9d Yolanda said of her daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe person who, in the midst of that pain, she took her time to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And so while few expected Ogunbowale to be the first overall pick on Wednesday night, everyone wanted to hear from her, as she headed to Bleacher Report to talk about her favorite sneakers and to CBS for an on-camera interview, before getting down to the serious business of choosing a draft night outfit.'
b'Erin Kane, Ogunbowale\xe2\x80\x99s agent, had selected several options, and they headed to Express to see a stylist.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou look great in a jumpsuit,\xe2\x80\x9d the stylist said as Ogunbowale settled on a sea-foam green one.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Ogunbowale replied, ready for her close-up.'

b'Another wretched Knicks season has ended, but from its ashes a justifiable optimism is taking root. The Knicks have the money to add two star players this summer, and there is a growing buzz in the N.B.A. that they could acquire Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors and Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics, who can be free agents.'
b'With one of the top picks in the N.B.A. draft, optimism turns to giddiness. Could next season\xe2\x80\x99s Knicks feature not only Durant and Irving but also Zion Williamson, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s freshman sensation? Or will the Knicks trade their lottery pick for a standout like Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans?'
b'Such big names potentially brighten their future, but there\xe2\x80\x99s another name that could make a difference: James L. Dolan.'
b'And so it must be asked: Will Dolan, the unpredictable and imperious owner of the team, find a way to mess it all up?'
b'Based on his two-decade history as owner, there is reason to wonder. For the second time in five years, the Knicks won only 17 games, a franchise low. This was also the sixth consecutive year the Knicks failed to make the playoffs, and the 12th time in the last 15 years. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staggering level of impotence for a team that spends as much money as it does and has all the inherent advantages of playing in New York City at Madison Square Garden.'
b'That enduring failure, combined with Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s public mistreatment of some fans, has led to a growing anger and skepticism in a disaffected, if dedicated, fan base.'
b'Watching the team spin its wheels seems part of the appeal or burden: The Knicks have committed more than $800 million in payroll over the last decade \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention millions more spent on a revolving door of high-profile executives \xe2\x80\x94 and they spend over the league salary cap each year as a matter of course. They also have averaged no fewer than 19,000 fans a game, no matter how bad they were.'
b'There are always appealing visiting teams to watch, and some seasons have started strong only to fizzle. But with such a crucial summer on the horizon, the thinking among fans and Knicks observers goes, perhaps not even Dolan can mess up this opportunity to forge a proven winner.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he had a longer fuse when it comes to the fans,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A. from 1984 to 2014. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some overreactions, but it will have nothing to do with free agency or how the team is run. That all falls on Steve Mills and Scott Perry. Him having a short fuse at times will have zero bearing on player signings.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mills, the team president, has worked with Dolan on and off over the last two decades, and Perry is the general manager. They are the latest group that Dolan has entrusted to run the basketball side of the organization. (Others have included Isiah Thomas, Larry Brown, Donnie Walsh, Mike D\xe2\x80\x99Antoni and Phil Jackson \xe2\x80\x94 all highly compensated and most of them successful elsewhere but unable to succeed under Dolan.)'
b'Dolan may be seen as the odious, impulsive and vengeful tyrant of the Garden, but Stern said Dolan desperately wanted a championship squad.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJim has been on a crusade to get the best basketball people around him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stern said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he thought he had with Phil and Isiah and Donnie, and what he thinks he has now with Steve and Scott.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But even with some of those well-respected men, Dolan was known to interfere in basketball decisions, particularly Walsh\xe2\x80\x99s. Dolan has vowed to cease the meddling, and Mills says he has kept his word.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI keep him informed, but he does not get involved in what we do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mills said in a telephone interview last week.'
b'Dolan, however, did dictate to Mills which news outlets could be involved in some of Mills\xe2\x80\x99s own news conferences. On two occasions this season, The Daily News, which Dolan and Madison Square Garden accused of being biased against them, was not invited, meaning Mills did not have total authority over everything to do with the Knicks.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJim has strong opinions about the media,\xe2\x80\x9d Mills said, \xe2\x80\x9cand how he has been covered by the media and how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been covered by the media. Really, my focus and what I have complete control over, how we build this basketball team \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s what I lock into.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dolan declined to be interviewed for this article.'
b'Several other executives who have worked closely with Dolan over the years but did not want to be named in order to speak candidly described a complex man layered with contradictory impulses and character traits.'
b'He can be irrational but also is fiercely loyal to certain people. He can be socially awkward and quite charitable but also unleash a volcanic temper on employees.'
b'He is said to worship his father, Charles, 92, the founder of Cablevision. But while Charles Dolan would carry lists of employees\xe2\x80\x99 names in his pocket to help greet them and ask them about their lives, James Dolan is just as likely to walk past employees with barely a hello, associates said, and berate others in meetings. Many employees at the Garden simply try to keep their distance.'
b'Seth Abraham was the chief executive of Madison Square Garden for almost five years, until 2004, when Dolan was directly in charge of the Knicks, the Rangers and the Liberty. The two worked together closely.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got the right mind-set,\xe2\x80\x9d Abraham said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe issue is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a zealot and his passion sometimes overwhelms him and the people who work for him. His passion is hot.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Certainly, some fans and charities have benefited from his generosity, while others have felt the sting of his wrath.'
b'Most notably, Dolan had security guards wrestle Charles Oakley, a former Knick and fan favorite, out of the building in 2017, an unpleasant scene that unfolded in front of thousands. And last month he had guards detain and then bar another fan from the building who had called out to him, \xe2\x80\x9cSell the team!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Although Dolan may eventually sell the Knicks and the Rangers (he sold the Liberty), few think he will do so any time soon, especially when the fortunes of the team could be close to changing significantly. The Knicks are valued at $4 billion, the highest in the league, according to Forbes magazine.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t like him because of the team\xe2\x80\x99s record and because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t engage much with them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Enes Kanter, the center who played parts of two seasons with the Knicks until he was released in February and is now on the Portland Trail Blazers, who are in the playoffs. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if they knew him more directly they would probably like him more.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kanter said the fans had the right to feel the way they did because New York City is a great city, but its basketball team has struggled historically. \xe2\x80\x9cThey deserve a good team,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'
b'They have not had one \xe2\x80\x94 a real good one \xe2\x80\x94 in 20 years, and the anger mounts. In fact, fear of a growing dissatisfaction among fans led to the Garden quietly limiting the amount of beer and alcohol that could be purchased at games late this season, perhaps a prudent decision considering the level of frustration in a fan base with little to cheer.'
b'Prudent decisions have not always been the norm with the Knicks. This is the organization that Stern once said was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a model of intelligent management.\xe2\x80\x9d That comment came a dozen years ago, toward the end of an ugly time in the history of the organization, when a former Garden executive, Anucha Browne Sanders, sued the Knicks and Thomas for sexual harassment, and won in court.'
b'There is also a perception among fans and people in the league that prospective players want no part of the bungling Knicks because the team is mismanaged to a point where winning is nearly impossible. In 2015, the Knicks made offers to LaMarcus Aldridge, Greg Monroe and DeAndre Jordan, who was coming off two very productive seasons at the time, and all three signed elsewhere. The next year, the Knicks could not even get a meeting with Durant.'
b'Now the hope is that Durant has changed his mind, perhaps convinced that he and Irving or another top free agent could be the ones to lead the Knicks to their first title since 1973. But with the Dolan wild card, hungry Knicks fans cannot be sure.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has cultivated an environment where N.B.A. guys don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gary Horn, 57, a lifelong Knicks fan and screenwriter who grew up in New York and now lives in California. \xe2\x80\x9cBut his grand flaw is that he has deputized people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to draft young players.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A few years ago at the Chicago predraft camp, Mills said, players and their agents told him that they did not want to join the Knicks but said the reason was more about the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 strategy under the former executive Phil Jackson.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the organization, style of play, however you want to talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mills said.'
b'Mills added that he and Perry were working hard to change the perception of the Knicks and that David Fizdale, the coach, was a draw for both players and fans by dint of his magnetic personality.'
b'Some fans are ready to believe the circumstances have aligned for a superteam.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf Durant thinks playing for the Knicks is what\xe2\x80\x99s best for his business and branding goals,\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Macri, a fan and founder of the Knicks Film School, a website dedicated to the team, said, \xe2\x80\x9cDolan\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as an unpleasant, impulsive individual isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to change that.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The hiring of the W.N.B.A. point guard Kristi Toliver as a full-time assistant coach with the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Wizards while she is still an active player was widely applauded as a notable new achievement for women in coaching.'
b'It followed the San Antonio Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 hiring of Becky Hammon, and other women like Nancy Lieberman and Jenny Boucek also joining N.B.A. coaching staffs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith anything, you need to see it to be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Briann January, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury and, in her off-season, an assistant women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at Arizona State. \xe2\x80\x9cI see it now because of Becky. Because of Kristi. I see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional area.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For many players, the moves showed N.B.A. teams tapping into a longstanding, significant pipeline of female talent.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think a lot of women in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunities in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team, to any organization, no matter our gender,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alana Beard, a veteran Los Angeles Sparks guard often mentioned as a coaching candidate by her peers.'
b'Beard cited the meager pay Toliver is to receive this season \xe2\x80\x94 just $10,000 because of limits in the W.N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s collective bargaining agreement \xe2\x80\x94 as an \xe2\x80\x9cextremely important\xe2\x80\x9d issue for the league to address in negotiations for a new agreement. The goal would be making a barrier that has long been permeable on one side \xe2\x80\x94 men into women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball on the coaching side \xe2\x80\x94 into a free exchange of talent, regardless of gender, based on opportunity.'
b'Many, if not most, W.N.B.A. players, who are paid significantly less than their male counterparts, cannot afford to spend their off-season working for so little pay. Their basketball skills are worth much more \xe2\x80\x94 into the millions of dollars \xe2\x80\x94 in service of women\xe2\x80\x99s leagues overseas.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll of those things on a coach\xe2\x80\x99s plate to take care of, to do that for $10,000 for an entire N.B.A. season is crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d January said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to break that down and do the math, like how much that is a game or how much that is a day. That would just be insult to injury.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Yet some people, including commentators on internet sites and men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball fans in real life, contend these women should be happy to have opportunities at all.'
b'This attitude rankles many W.N.B.A. players \xe2\x80\x94 that even Toliver\xe2\x80\x99s shot, let alone chances for other women with considerable experience playing and in many cases coaching, is often thought of as a one-sided benefit for those who are hired.'
b'But in many cases, the N.B.A. came calling after seeing the women excelling on their own. Toliver\xe2\x80\x99s work with the Mystics helped bring her to the attention of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks, just as Hammon got her opportunity in San Antonio because she was employed by the Silver Stars, then owned by the same group as the Spurs, and her W.N.B.A. coach, Dan Hughes, talked her up to Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had a chance to put two parties together that I knew would work,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes, now the head coach of the Seattle Storm, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew Becky, and I also knew Pop, and I knew that Pop, we had a lot of years of conversation about Becky. He had seen her play when I first brought her to San Antonio. So to me it was an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each other.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Toliver has opened up that discussion in significant ways, which she said was a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place. In Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, it is nothing less than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia has prevented the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the women\xe2\x80\x99s side of the sport, the next step toward N.B.A. teams and W.N.B.A. teams and men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s college basketball programs all hiring from the same pool of candidates.'
b'As Hughes sees it, it\xe2\x80\x99s time, not because these women deserve a chance, but because every basketball team needs more coaches like Hammon, Toliver and those who will follow.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want a world someday where people judge coaches on how good a coach they truly are,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if they\xe2\x80\x99re male or female, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter their background. They can say he\xe2\x80\x99s a coach or she\xe2\x80\x99s a coach, and we can use them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Every W.N.B.A. player who stays home instead of playing overseas in her off-season, the athletes said, is potentially one more person around which to promote the league year-round, and that player gets to rest, too. The grind of playing 12 months a year has led to W.N.B.A. players like Diana Taurasi and Angel McCoughtry taking seasons off.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou always want to protect your product,\xe2\x80\x9d January said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up year-round playing this game. So when they come back around to play in the W.N.B.A., you have half of your players injured, playing through nagging things. We still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball, which is crazy to me.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe just have some really strong women, but that needs to be a discussion. What can we do to provide other opportunities for women to make income and prepare for the future on a real-life scale? Something they can live on. Something that makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Seven years ago, Tacko Fall and Christ Koumadje were discovered by basketball scouts in a similar fashion.'
b'They were hard to miss.'
b'On the streets of Dakar, Senegal, the two 7-footers stood out. They were spotted by employees of the Flying Star Academy, a Senegalese training ground for several basketball players who have ended up on college teams in the United States. The employees chased after the teenagers, imploring them to try their enormous hands at the sport.'
b'[Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]'
b'At the time, Koumadje, now a 7-foot-4 senior at Florida State, preferred soccer. Fall, now a 7-foot-6 senior at Central Florida, was more interested in devouring anime and manga series like \xe2\x80\x9cNaruto\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTokyo Ghoul.\xe2\x80\x9d Both were, at first, indifferent to basketball.'
b'But their potential upside was difficult to ignore. To onlookers, they evoked thoughts of the next Hakeem Olajuwon or Yao Ming.'
b'Today, their size offers less promise. They toiled to become giant forces in the paint, only to watch as basketball evolved from a game that coveted height into a more freewheeling, 3-point-centric game that deems their skill sets nearly as obsolete as a fax machine: nice to have, but no longer entirely necessary.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s interesting about both, their advanced analytics, they play off the charts \xe2\x80\x94 well over 1 point per possession, and that\xe2\x80\x99s really effective in college basketball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Kyler, the editor and publisher of Basketball Insiders, which produces weekly N.B.A. mock drafts. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you dig deeper, in situational-type things they grade really well, but the truth of the matter is the N.B.A. game isn\xe2\x80\x99t played that way anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about stretch 5s, quickness.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think they may get a look on the fringe based off their size,\xe2\x80\x9d Kyler added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a guy 7-foot-6 being the first overall pick or top five is pretty rare now.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the college game, where height can still create a tangible advantage, Fall and Koumadje \xe2\x80\x94 who are among the tallest players currently in Division I \xe2\x80\x94 will be crucial cogs in their teams\xe2\x80\x99 N.C.A.A. tournament performance.'
b'Beyond that, whether they can find a place and purpose in the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 where the only active players who stand 7-foot-3 or taller are Dallas\xe2\x80\x99s Kristaps Porzingis, who has a far more diverse skill set, and Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Boban Marjanovic \xe2\x80\x94 remains to be seen.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cExtending my range is something I definitely want to work on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fall, who helped the Knights earn their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2005 by averaging nearly 11 points and 7 rebounds a game. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go out there and shoot 3s like a lot of bigs do now, but pick my spots.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I feel like no matter how the game has changed, you still need somebody down low to do some damage.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Basketball academies in Senegal like Flying Star now regularly send players abroad. After playing for a few months at the academy, Fall got a chance to join a high school team in the United States. His mother reluctantly let her son go, hoping he would receive a better education.'
b'Extremely raw when he arrived at Liberty Christian Preparatory School in Tavares, Fla., Fall almost quit basketball. But he refined his game while playing on a travel team alongside Ben Simmons, now with the Philadelphia 76ers. Fall also trained in Houston with Olajuwon, a Hall of Famer who emphasized the importance of footwork for a center his size.'
b'Occasionally, Fall watched Simmons at nearby Montverde Academy, where Koumadje landed after coming to the United States. Fall and Koumadje only briefly overlapped in Dakar \xe2\x80\x94 Koumadje is originally from Chad \xe2\x80\x94 but in high school they talked on the phone or via Facebook. Their discussions rarely veered into basketball. Instead, they commiserated about the difficulties of adjusting to life when you are over 7 feet tall and 4,500 miles from home.'
b'Koumadje, like Fall, grasps the unlikelihood that he will develop into a free-shooting N.B.A. big man. Before his senior year in high school, he played pickup games at the University of Southern California with Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons. It was then, Koumadje said, that he realized he was more effective cemented in the post.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe game is evolving and that\xe2\x80\x99s what people want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koumadje, a two-year starter who led the Seminoles in blocked shots this season. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I play to my strength. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fall\xe2\x80\x99s turning point came after his sophomore season at Central Florida, when he contemplated entering the 2017 N.B.A. draft. Five teams told him he needed vast improvement adapting to the speed of the pros, particularly in guarding pick-and-rolls.'
b'Central Florida Coach Johnny Dawkins \xe2\x80\x94 a former Duke guard who played with the towering centers Shawn Bradley and Manute Bol in the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 was hired before Fall\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore year, and created a three-year plan for him. Increasing mobility and stamina came first, followed by catching the ball down low and learning to work out of double and triple teams. This season, Dawkins has moved Fall farther out on the perimeter defensively.'
b'Wherever he stands, Fall often forces opposing players to elevate more when they shoot, to get the ball over his arms.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur floaters have to be a little bit higher, and it probably screwed a couple of guys up,\xe2\x80\x9d Fran Dunphy, Temple\xe2\x80\x99s coach at the time, said after a game against Central Florida on March 9.'
b'Teams have tried less inventive strategies to bypass Fall\xe2\x80\x99s 8-foot-4 wingspan. Fall, who is bulkier than Bol or Bradley, said that he had heard opposing coaches tell players to go after his knees.'
b'Though he is all but assured of breaking the Division I record for career field-goal percentage \xe2\x80\x94 he currently shoots over 74 percent; the record is 67.8 \xe2\x80\x94 Fall converts only 36 percent of his free throws. Fall \xe2\x80\x94 whose hands are 10\xc2\xbd inches long \xe2\x80\x94 said that when he shoots free throws it feels as if he is holding a volleyball.'
b"His shooting form, which involves using only his right hand while flinging his left arm in the air and then slouching, has drawn derisive comments on social media, where he is sometimes treated as a sideshow. After Fall had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Houston that ended the Cougars' 33-game home winning streak, Fall got more attention for a GIF that showed him holding the ball over an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s head like an older brother playing keep-away."
b'Fall and Koumadje are accustomed to stares in airports and snide remarks from opposing fans. While both harbor N.B.A. dreams \xe2\x80\x94 neither appears in most mock drafts \xe2\x80\x94 they also envision a life beyond basketball, when their height won\xe2\x80\x99t dictate how others perceive them.'
b'Koumadje said he would eventually like to work for the United Nations, helping refugees in Chad. Fall wants to become an engineer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBasketball\xe2\x80\x99s opened a lot of doors for me, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to me than the ball, the hoop,\xe2\x80\x9d Fall said. \xe2\x80\x9cI definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be defined by that. I definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be seen as an attraction, either.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Hours after Magic Johnson abruptly resigned as the Los Angeles Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 president of basketball operations, and mere minutes after LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s first season as the franchise cornerstone ended with a buzzer-beating loss, James left Staples Center on Tuesday night without speaking to reporters, trailed only by security officers and questions about the team\xe2\x80\x99s future.'
b'It was not the season anyone envisioned for the Lakers, who had upended the N.B.A. by signing James last summer with the hype and expectation of returning the franchise to its glory years. One of the most storied teams in the league, the Lakers have not won a championship in nine years, and Los Angeles is frustrated, hungry and impatient.'
b'Instead, the team collected nearly as many injuries as losses. James, who will miss the N.B.A. playoffs beginning Saturday for the first time in 14 years, watched the final six games of the season from the bench as the team looked to preserve him for next season. His next buzzy stop is a studio lot as the star of \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Jam 2,\xe2\x80\x9d which he has said is set to begin filming this summer.'
b'For the Lakers (37-45), all the drama was off the court, right up to the end, with Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt announcement so out-of-the-blue that he had not even told his boss, the team owner Jeanie Buss, before wading into a gaggle of reporters.'
b'[Here is a look at Magic Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s biggest moments as team president.]'
b'On Wednesday morning, Johnson, 59, wrote on Twitter that he considers himself a \xe2\x80\x9cLaker for life.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He announced in 1991 that he was H.I.V. positive but said Tuesday that he was in good health and it was not a factor in his decision.'
b'Johnson had sealed a $154 million, four-year deal for James \xe2\x80\x94 two greats fulfilling their needs: Johnson to restore luster to a glamorous team; James to close out his career as a Laker and develop his business and entertainment interests centered on Hollywood.'
b'And now they both left Staples Center with a losing record and a team in chaos.'
b'In some ways, it was the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunction.'
b'So there was the coach, Luke Walton, saying what losing coaches always say: essentially, wait until next year. His job may have been saved when Johnson quit, but he would not talk about that.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of time to work and get better,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said late Tuesday after the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s organize and prioritize what we need to do so we can give ourselves a better chance next season.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was a wasted season for everyone involved, and James is as polarizing as ever, even in Los Angeles, where as much as fans banked on him, they also retained a degree of skepticism that this was all real.'
b'Jonas Never, a prominent Los Angeles-based street artist, found that out the hard way.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly,\xe2\x80\x9d Never said in a telephone interview, \xe2\x80\x9cLakers fans are the trickiest.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Last July, he had talked a restaurant owner in Venice Beach into allowing him to paint a mural of James in a Lakers jersey to commemorate his arrival: 75 cans of spray paint in 12 hours for the \xe2\x80\x9cKing of L.A.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It did not take long for the mural to be vandalized \xe2\x80\x94 not just once, but twice in a span of four days. The first time, it was salvageable. Someone had defaced the wall with the words \xe2\x80\x9cWe Don\xe2\x80\x99t Want You\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNo King,\xe2\x80\x9d along with \xe2\x80\x9c3-6,\xe2\x80\x9d a reference to James\xe2\x80\x99s losing record in the N.B.A. finals. But Never was able to restore the mural. (\xe2\x80\x9cA two-minute fix,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.)'
b'The second time, someone splashed yellow paint all over James\xe2\x80\x99s face, and Never had no choice but to paint over it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been a car, it would have been totaled,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'To be fair, most fans were excited about James. The news media coverage was breathless. And perhaps no member of the ticket-paying public had invested more in LeBron-to-L.A. than Jacob Emrani, a personal injury lawyer from Beverly Hills, Calif., who had purchased space for 40 James-themed billboards in the run-up to free agency.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was going to be something where we missed the playoffs or thought, \xe2\x80\x98What the hell is happening here?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Emrani said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in the breaks we got, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not necessarily disappointed in LeBron. We were in fourth place when he went down.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Emrani was referring to what may have been the season\xe2\x80\x99s turning point: the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 ill-fated Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors, which James himself cited in a recent interview with Spectrum SportsNet, the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 broadcast partner. The Lakers were playing solid basketball at the time \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, they clobbered the Warriors to improve their record to 20-14 \xe2\x80\x94 but James injured his groin in the third quarter and wound up missing the next 17 games. The Lakers went into a tailspin without him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDisappointed in my body,\xe2\x80\x9d James told Spectrum SportsNet, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I knew exactly where we were at that point. And we just were never able to get back from that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Once James returned, the team\xe2\x80\x99s front office unsuccessfully tried to engineer a trade for another big star, the New Orleans Pelicans\xe2\x80\x99 Anthony Davis \xe2\x80\x94 this, after James had told ESPN that it would be \xe2\x80\x9camazing\xe2\x80\x9d to play alongside Davis.'
b'The plan appeared to be to essentially trade away the rest of the team. The fallout was clear: Whatever fragile bonds that remained in the home locker room at Staples Center seemed to fray at the seams.'
b'For many fans, it was impossible to dissociate James from the failed trade \xe2\x80\x94 James and Davis share an agent, Rich Paul \xe2\x80\x94 and much of the mess that followed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNearly everyone on the roster was involved in those trade rumors,\xe2\x80\x9d Never said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you really feel wanted if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be packing your locker the next day?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As the losses mounted, so did the criticisms of James: that he appeared detached from his teammates, that basketball was secondary to his growing interest in his entertainment company, that his body was finally breaking down after so many years of athletic genius, that he was no longer capable of carrying a team to a title.'
b'But in the 55 games that James did play this season, he was pretty good. He averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists a game while shooting 51 percent from the field. Besides, a long summer may benefit him after so many extended playoff runs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that was hard was that he got hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said late Tuesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes time to build a relationship with somebody. But as our relationship grew and I got to see what it was like coaching him, it was great. And I believe if we could have stayed healthy, we would have had a very successful season. He\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible player.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For his part, James told Spectrum SportsNet that he wanted to use the summer to get his body back to \xe2\x80\x9c120 percent\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of training camp \xe2\x80\x94 even as he moonlights on the set of \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Jam 2.\xe2\x80\x9d He has been adamant that his work in entertainment will not interfere with his work on the basketball court.'
b'The question is whether one bad season will become two. So much hinges on the summer as the Lakers look to add another star to their roster. (Emrani said he had plans for more billboards, though he declined to say which top-tier free agents he would target.) James has said that he will be as involved in the team\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting efforts as possible.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to seeing who jumps in the car with me and wants to take this ride to the top,\xe2\x80\x9d James said in his interview with Spectrum SportsNet. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I bring to the game. I know my commitment to the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never cheated the game, and throughout my career, it\xe2\x80\x99s always given back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Back in Venice Beach, Never painted a new mural during the middle of the N.F.L. season, replacing LeBron James with Derwin James, a safety for the Los Angeles Chargers. The mural has been up for months, Never said, and no one has touched it.'
b'An earlier version of this article misstated when LeBron James injured his groin during a game against the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. It was in the third quarter, not the first half.'

b'SACRAMENTO \xe2\x80\x94 The Boston Celtics were not in a good place when they boarded a plane bound for California on Sunday. They were coming off a home loss to the Houston Rockets that point guard Kyrie Irving punctuated by using a total of 43 words to answer nine questions in his postgame news conference.'
b'At one point, he was asked whether he thought the team could cobble together some momentum on its West Coast trip.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.'
b'Just one season removed from a run to the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern Conference finals, and seemingly improved by the re-addition of Gordon Hayward and the continued development of their young core, the Celtics were on the brink of falling apart. Any hope they still harbored of being a championship-ready team was as brittle as a toothpick.'
b'But after some reflection and conversation, the Celtics regained a bit of their swagger with back-to-back wins this week against the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. The Celtics will see if they can keep the good vibes going on Saturday against the Los Angeles Lakers, which is anything but certain, especially for Irving, whose season has been clouded by questions about his future with the team.'
b'Such uncertainty does not make Irving unique in the modern N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 Kevin Durant of the Warriors and Kawhi Leonard of the Toronto Raptors are among the other stars who will weigh big decisions in free agency this summer \xe2\x80\x94 but the Celtics have let the noise affect them.'
b'With the two wins this week improving their record to 40-26, the Celtics may be showing signs that they are finally, mercifully, learning how to cope.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat long plane ride helped us out,\xe2\x80\x9d Irving said after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s lopsided victory over the Warriors. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that. We needed it. We needed it. We were going to get to a point where we were just going to get tired of fighting each other, fighting the outside world when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter. So we just wanted to come out here and play basketball.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is our sanctuary, and we have to do everything we can to protect it. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone infiltrate it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Irving, who missed Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s win against the Kings with a left thigh contusion, is averaging a team-leading 23.4 points a game along with 7 assists and 4.9 rebounds, both career highs. He is also shooting 49.5 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range.'
b'He also ranks among the N.B.A. leaders in mercurial behavior. He has been vague about the specific source of his discontent, but it may have something to do with his pending free agency.'
b'Irving backed off an earlier pledge to re-sign with the Celtics after they struggled at the start of the season. In fact, during a trip to New York to play the Knicks on Feb. 1, he told a group of reporters in his own colorfully abrasive way that he did not owe anyone anything. The Knicks, of course, would be interested in signing Irving, a six-time All-Star who grew up in New Jersey and has a soft spot for Madison Square Garden.'
b'Then came the All-Star break, and a clip of Irving and Durant having an inaudible conversation found its way to the internet, where an army of amateur lip readers tried to decode what they were saying. Worth noting: Irving and Durant are close friends. Also worth noting: The Knicks will have enough cap space this summer for two max contracts.'
b'Irving refused to shed light on their chat, and said it was nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business, which was his prerogative. But it had the general effect of using a napkin to mop up an oil spill.'
b'Since then, Irving has been alluding to nefarious forces and the steep cost of celebrity, saying he hates the spotlight \xe2\x80\x94 even as he sells sneakers and moonlights as an actor. He reiterated his disdain this week after collecting 19 points and 11 assists against the Warriors, his 17th double-double this season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe business part of it is just what makes it terrible for me \xe2\x80\x94 honestly, dealing with all this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the reporters around him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to be honest with you guys: The basketball part of it? I have to keep that fun. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99m great. Being around my teammates, that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me happy. And the business part of it is going to be business.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was not lost on anyone who witnessed this exchange that Irving was bashing the business of basketball while wearing an Uncle Drew ball cap \xe2\x80\x94 the same Uncle Drew character he popularized in soft drink commercials and then parlayed into a movie released last year.'
b'As for the basketball itself, well, Boston has had an uneven season, the product of a team that is not nearly Lakers-level dysfunctional but is not exactly cohesive, either. The Celtics arrived for their game against the Warriors having lost five of their last six games, and their locker room was a joyless place.'
b'Perhaps they needed to get away from Boston. Perhaps they needed perspective. Perhaps Irving needed to speak with Danny Ainge, the team\xe2\x80\x99s president of basketball operations, and Brad Stevens, its coach, who reminded Irving that the team still had a lot of season left to play. It was not over, not yet, not by any stretch.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery team has to find a togetherness in competing,\xe2\x80\x9d Stevens said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome teams, it takes 60 games. Some teams, it takes 20 games. And bad teams never get there. We hope that it took us 60 games, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t proven ourselves to be great at that yet for a long stretch of time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In their 128-95 win against the Warriors, the Celtics had 38 assists on 49 field goals. They also communicated. When Irving and forward Jaylen Brown botched a play that led to an early turnover, Brown patted himself on the chest to apologize, then appeared to apologize a second time on their next trip up the court.'
b'The next night, in Sacramento, Irving sat behind the visiting bench for the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 111-109 victory over the Kings. He was vocal. He did a lot of fist-pumping. And he celebrated when Hayward, less than 24 hours after scoring 30 points against the Warriors, connected on the game-winner.'
b'After suffering a grisly ankle injury in the opening game and missing last season, Hayward has struggled to find a rhythm in his return. Maybe he found it here in California, along with the rest of the team. The Celtics are too talented to let this opportunity go to waste, because who knows how long it will last?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as my teammates are feeling good,\xe2\x80\x9d Irving said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we\xe2\x80\x99re in a good place.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Sylvia Hatchell, the longtime women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at the University of North Carolina, stepped down after an investigation found she had made \xe2\x80\x9cracially insensitive\xe2\x80\x9d comments and pressured injured players to compete, the university announced late Thursday night.'
b'Hatchell, who is fifth in career coaching victories in N.C.A.A. women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball, was placed on leave this month, days after parents of several players met with the university\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, to complain about comments she had made that players interpreted as racist, including a warning that a bad loss could lead to \xe2\x80\x9cnooses.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The report \xe2\x80\x9cfound issues that led us to conclude that the program needed to be taken in a new direction,\xe2\x80\x9d Cunningham said in a statement.'
b'Hatchell, 67, did not address the accusations in the statement, which described her departure as a resignation. Instead, it said she had been contemplating this move since she was given a diagnosis of leukemia several years ago.'
b'Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer declined to say Friday whether the university had asked for her resignation, and said the coach had been signaling to university officials in recent weeks that she might retire. At the time of her suspension, he said he hoped she would return to coaching.'
b'While the university attributed the decision to the results of an investigation it commissioned by an outside law firm, the announcement came just hours before The Washington Post published an article detailing several instances in which players said that Hatchell or her staff had inappropriately pushed players to compete through injury. The university had learned of the contents of the article just a few hours before releasing the statement, The Post said.'
b'The review, conducted for the university by the law firm Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein, \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that Hatchell is not viewed as a racist,\xe2\x80\x9d the university said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut her comments and subsequent response caused many in the program to believe she lacked awareness and appreciation for the effect her remarks had on those who heard them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The statement added, \xe2\x80\x9cPlayers and medical staff expressed frustration with perceived and undue influence from Hatchell regarding medical issues and pressure to play.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wade M. Smith, a lawyer for Hatchell, insisted in an interview Friday that Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s remarks had been misinterpreted or misconstrued. And he resisted accusations that Hatchell had improperly pressed injured women to play.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat like all people, she would urge her players to be tough.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The incident comes at a sensitive time for the university, which has been divided over the status of a famous campus statue of a Confederate soldier. It also comes as Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s teams \xe2\x80\x94 she had been the head coach since 1986 \xe2\x80\x94 appeared to be in competitive decline. While the Tar Heels were regular national contenders in the 1990s and 2000s, and won their sole national championship in 1994, they only twice reached the second weekend of the N.C.A.A. tournament this decade, and even those times were with the aid of several standout players who later transferred out of the program.'
b'This year, the team finished 18-15 and lost in the N.C.A.A. tournament\xe2\x80\x99s first round.'
b'Smith, Hatchell\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, said he had not received a copy of the law firm\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball program.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt we ever will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t even care. For us, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s ancient history now.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The crush of bodies surrounding Dwyane Wade as he left an N.B.A. court for the last time as an active player had the effect of a small tidal wave, surging through the jammed Barclays Center tunnel, head-on into a pack of waiting well-wishers.'
b'At the rear of the crowd stood Pat Riley, who brought Wade to Miami 16 years ago, nurtured him to stardom, celebrated three championships with him, let him get away in 2016 over a contract dispute and less than two years later welcomed him home with open arms.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhoa,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley said, hands on the shoulders of his wife, Chris, steadying her against the swell of humanity.'
b'Now here, finally, came Wade, man of the hour. Wade and Riley, both standing 6 feet 4 inches, made eye contact. Riley raised his right arm forward. Wade reached above the security detail, clasping his hand with the team president\xe2\x80\x99s. The linchpins of the Miami Heat franchise pulled together for a heartfelt embrace.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne more,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley told Wade. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a max contract for you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Wade snickered. Riley chortled. It was the self-mocking joke Riley could tell and they both could enjoy after Wade, having gone home again following unfulfilling detours to Chicago and Cleveland, was given the send-off he deserved.'
b'After being traded back to Miami by the Cavaliers early last year, Wade talked himself into a last dance for the 2018-19 season, many nights of which he played younger than his well-worn 37 years. Properly feted before Miami\xe2\x80\x99s home schedule closeout on Tuesday night, he scored 30 points in a victory over Philadelphia and topped it off with a playful triple double (25 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) as the Heat\xe2\x80\x99s season ended 24 hours later with a 113-94 defeat to the playoff-bound Nets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can retire and be happy about my career,\xe2\x80\x9d Wade would say, sporting a gold and black jacket in the interview room, on his way out to dance the night away with a guest list that included his N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x9cbrotherhood\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul.'
b'However dapper at 74, with a fine head of combed-back gray hair, Riley was never part of that social scene, just the patriarch who landed Wade with the fifth pick of the 2003 draft, considered at the time to be a consolation prize after James, Darko Milicic, Anthony and Chris Bosh were the first four players chosen.'
b'But Wade was more special than anyone imagined during his time at Marquette, a world-class gymnast in basketball footwear, with the uncommon calm of a cocksure gunslinger.'
b'When Wade had moved on into the corridor leading to the locker room, I told Riley about a 2005 playoff night in Auburn Hills, Mich., when Wade, as a second-year player, was making life quite difficult for the defending champion, defensively stout Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals.'
b'Taking a halftime stroll, I ran into Chuck Daly, who as the Pistons coach in the late 1980s had devised a defense specifically for Michael Jordan \xe2\x80\x94 the famous Jordan Rules.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, he\xe2\x80\x99s got some Jordan in him,\xe2\x80\x9d Daly said, dragging on a cigarette, when I asked what he thought of the young Wade. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got all the things you can\xe2\x80\x99t teach.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Riley nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cChuck was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Wade had other elite qualities besides the balletic ability to score from angles we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sure actually existed. He could pass like a point guard when his team needed an assist. He was a solid team defender. He retires as the most productive shot-blocking guard in N.B.A. history, having last month nudged past Jordan.'
b'Flashy as he was, Wade had some Tim Duncan in him, too. Until James arrived with Bosh in the summer of 2010, he was unquestionably the franchise star without having to broadcast it to the world, and his door was open to anyone who could give him a better chance to win.'
b'Wade embraced Riley\xe2\x80\x99s 2004 acquisition of Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal when Kobe Bryant wanted no part of the big fella in Los Angeles. He recruited James while fully aware of how the self-proclaimed King was great at basketball, as well as sucking the oxygen out of an organization.'
b'When James departed after two titles and four consecutive runs to the finals, Riley called it the most devastating blow of his time in Miami, but Wade insisted there were no hard feelings. It was business. He was still being paid to play basketball, live in Miami. How could life not be good?'
b'Yet he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t immune to wounded pride when Riley refused to give him a third contract year in 2016, citing Wade\xe2\x80\x99s balky knees and declining stats. Wade left, reluctantly, one more divorce in a league of ever-transient stars.'
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong, nothing at all, with players maximizing free agency, leveraging their way to whichever location suits them at a certain career stage. James of course has been the pied piper of the paradigm. Kevin Durant is reportedly poised to again follow his lead, right out of Golden State.'
b'But James\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, a convenient excuse to avoiding dealing with Magic Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s sudden, stunning disappearance from the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 front office, was a reminder that the more moves a player makes, the better the odds he might eventually outmaneuver himself.'
b'Meanwhile, Dirk Nowitzki, like Wade, was also demonstrating the currency in continuity, finishing a 21-year run Wednesday night with the Dallas Mavericks to widespread acclaim. Manu Ginobili and Duncan were similarly deified for staying the course in San Antonio. Wade will remain the toast of South Florida.'
b'In the Miami locker room, a few young Heat players lined up for Wade to sign their jerseys and sneakers. The No. 3 jersey he wore was given to Anthony, a shooter without a squad after parting ways with Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Houston Rockets this season after a mere 10 games.'
b'Anthony did manage to scoop up a ball rolling out of bounds in the fourth quarter by the corner front row from where he, Paul and James were cheering on Wade. He took one dribble and, thankfully, resisted the temptation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to play against Melo this season and exchange jerseys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wade, explaining the gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the missing piece.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Throughout his career, wherever he lit up the scoreboard, Anthony seemed to miss the point, unwilling to \xe2\x80\x94 as former President Barack Obama said of Wade in a video tribute \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9csometimes sacrifice your ego in pursuit of a title.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'If Anthony never plays again in the N.B.A., is there a moral to their divergent stories? Only if the most graceful departure possible is a priority, part of the plan. It apparently was for Wade. He left with a self-assured smile and, while indicating he would probably need therapy to deal with the time on his hands, he ruled out a potential return.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody knows this is for real,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x94 DeMarcus Cousins used to watch soap operas with his grandmother when he was growing up. She would refer to them as her \xe2\x80\x9cstories,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and \xe2\x80\x9cAs the World Turns\xe2\x80\x9d was her favorite. Cousins could never fully relate to the absurd drama of his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s stories until this season, when he joined the Golden State Warriors.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery episode it was something,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what this has turned into.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Cousins is sometimes an innocent bystander. (Consider the midseason beef between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green that stemmed from a late-game meltdown against the Los Angeles Clippers and bled into Durant\xe2\x80\x99s impending free agency.) But sometimes Cousins is involved, even if it is not his choice. He was aware, for example, before Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Houston Rockets, that members of the news media and the general public were picking apart his defense and referring to him as a liability.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe all been in this business long enough to know how it goes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousins, a 6-foot-11 center. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around this team to know how things go around here. You\xe2\x80\x99re always looking for something to make a story. I mean, I could care less. You all got to do your jobs, and I got to do mine.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For all the laments about Cousins\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability in pick-and-roll defensive situations, there is no denying his offensive impact when he is focused, and he was supremely focused against the Rockets on Wednesday night, collecting 27 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists in a 106-104 victory that infused the team with some positive vibes.'
b'Scoring down low, passing out of the post, setting meaty screens \xe2\x80\x94 Cousins does things that the Warriors have seldom featured in their four-plus seasons of dominance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor as long as we can remember, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a guy we can just throw the ball to in the post and work around him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen Curry said.'
b'It is still a process, of course, both for the Warriors, who are working to incorporate another mammoth personality into their fold as they pursue a third straight championship, and for Cousins, a four-time All-Star who spent the first few months of the season building strength and working on his conditioning as he recovered from an Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon tear.'
b'Since Cousins made his season debut on Jan. 18, the Warriors are 15-7. But they had lost six of their last 10 games entering Wednesday, and the general mood of the team felt flat. Curry likened it to when Durant joined the Warriors in 2016, and the team spent the first two or three months of the season trying to find its rhythm.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a little sensitivity to how everybody was going to get their shots,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, we\xe2\x80\x99re all talented and we all have high basketball I.Q.s, so just let things happen. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to force anything. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been good at it at times, and not so good at other times. So it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of sticking with the program.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After sinking 11 of 16 shots against the Rockets, Cousins acknowledged that it was the best he had felt since he made his return.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Cousins said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had stretches where it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of flowing for everybody. But this is a team that\xe2\x80\x99s been together for a while, and they\xe2\x80\x99re used to playing a certain type of way. So for me to just come in \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m not expecting this team to adjust to me. Obviously, I have to adjust to them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Durant missed the game with a sprained ankle, which meant that Cousins had more playmaking opportunities than usual. Coach Steve Kerr made some adjustments, too, staggering Cousins and Green for stretches so that each had more room to operate in the middle of the court. Kerr has also been advising his players to pump the brakes in transition.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes we\xe2\x80\x99ve played a little too fast and shot too many quick shots instead of letting him get down on the block and controlling things,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said, referring to Cousins. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to remind ourselves that this is still early in the process. We\xe2\x80\x99re all learning. Me too. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to learn to use him better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'If Cousins still appears to labor at times (or most of the time) to get overly airborne, his confidence seems fine.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can stop me one on one, period,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you can put whoever you want on me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Warriors and the Rockets have history. In last season\xe2\x80\x99s Western Conference finals, Houston had a 3-2 series lead against Golden State, but Chris Paul injured his hamstring in Game 5. The Rockets lost the final two games of the series without him, and the Warriors went on to successfully defend their N.B.A. championship.'
b'Cousins was not involved in that series, but he is a part of the dynamic now \xe2\x80\x94 and the Warriors are not quite finished preparing themselves for the postseason. Andrew Bogut, a defense-minded center who last played for Golden State in 2016, is expected to join the team in the coming days after an M.V.P. season with the Sydney Kings of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s National Basketball League. Kerr recently described Bogut as \xe2\x80\x9can insurance policy in the frontcourt.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Yes, the league\xe2\x80\x99s most compelling drama is about to welcome the return of a former cast member. For his part, Cousins said he would continue to focus on the only role he knows.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just want to play basketball,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'Kenny Anderson, a celebrated point guard from Queens who had a 14-year N.B.A. career, was hospitalized over the weekend after suffering a stroke.'
b'Lina Catalfamo Plath, a family spokeswoman, said via email that Anderson was recovering. Plath also released a statement from Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Natasha.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe would like to thank everyone for reaching out on behalf of Kenny,\xe2\x80\x9d Natasha Anderson said in the statement. \xe2\x80\x9cOur family is extremely grateful for all the prayers and love that we have received over the last few days. We appreciate you continuing to respect our privacy as Kenny heals.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Anderson, 48, recently concluded his first season as the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at Fisk University, a historically black school in Nashville that plays at the N.A.I.A. level.'
b'As a high school player at Archbishop Molloy, a powerhouse program in Queens, Anderson was one of the most prolific and high-profile players in the city\xe2\x80\x99s rich basketball history. A McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s All-American, Anderson set what was then a state scoring record with 2,621 points before enrolling at Georgia Tech, where he helped the team reach the Final Four in 1990.'
b'After Anderson spent two seasons at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the second overall pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft \xe2\x80\x94 Larry Johnson went first to the Charlotte Hornets \xe2\x80\x94 and Anderson enjoyed a productive career that never quite lived up to the hype that had followed him since he was a teenager. He averaged 12.6 points and 6.1 assists a game while playing for nine teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Portland Trail Blazers, and was an All-Star selection for the Nets in 1994.'
b'A 2017 documentary on Anderson called \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Chibbs\xe2\x80\x9d detailed many of his personal struggles, including bankruptcy and depression. In 2014, he traveled to North Korea as a member of the team that Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bulls forward, cobbled together at the invitation of Kim Jong-un, the country\xe2\x80\x99s leader.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistakes weren\xe2\x80\x99t really mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was being young and living and learning. Yes, I spent a lot of money; I went through a lot of money. I had some failed marriages \xe2\x80\x94 if you want to criticize me for that. You can\xe2\x80\x99t cry about your mishaps. I count my blessings, I don\xe2\x80\x99t count my mishaps.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Mike Bibby, the former N.B.A. player, is being investigated by the police over accusations of sexual abuse.'
b'Mr. Bibby, now a high school basketball coach in Arizona, was accused by a teacher who works at the same school, The Arizona Republic reported. The episode that prompted the accusations was said to have taken place in 2017.'
b'The Republic, citing a restraining order granted last week, said that Mr. Bibby had been accused of grabbing the teacher by the waist and pulling her into a car, then groping her and rubbing his genitals on her. After the woman left the car, the order said, he followed her and made sexual remarks. The woman said she did not know Mr. Bibby before the incident.'
b'The restraining order quoted the teacher as saying she was \xe2\x80\x9cin shock, in fear, intimidated by his actions, afraid of him as he smelled of alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A lawyer for Mr. Bibby denied the accusations.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can say with pretty much certainty this alleged incident didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen and that will be shown down the road,\xe2\x80\x9d Donald Harris, Mr. Bibby\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, told The Republic. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael Bibby did not participate in a sexual assault of any way, shape or form that was alleged by this lady two years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mr. Bibby recently coached the boys\xe2\x80\x99 basketball team to a fourth straight state championship at the school, Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix. He is also an alumnus of Shadow Mountain, and won a state championship as a player in the 1990s before attending the University of Arizona, where he won a national championship in 1997. He retired from the N.B.A. in 2012 after a 14-year career with six teams, most notably the Vancouver Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks. He spent his last season with the Knicks, playing 39 games after signing as a free agent in December 2011.'
b'For the past two summers, Mr. Bibby, 40, played with the Ghost Ballers of the Big3, a professional 3-on-3 basketball league founded by the rapper Ice Cube.'

b'DENVER \xe2\x80\x94 There was a time not long ago that basketball success in the Rocky Mountains was measured by the Denver Nuggets\xe2\x80\x99 ability to persuade a free agent of Dwyane Wade\xe2\x80\x99s stature to meet team brass in New York and let the Nuggets offer him millions.'
b'In the summer of 2016, only one season into the career of Nikola Jokic and with few hints to that point that the Nuggets already had a cornerstone player, just getting the opportunity to pitch Wade face-to-face was widely hailed as a triumph for this franchise.'
b'What went unrevealed that off-season was that Denver also made a futile run at Wade\xe2\x80\x99s longtime rival, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks. Nowitzki had no interest in even entertaining the idea of leaving the only team he had ever known, but that was the Nuggets in the embryonic stages of Jokic\xe2\x80\x99s development \xe2\x80\x94 straining to persuade some of the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names to take them seriously.'
b'Three years later, Jokic is a certifiable All-Star and his team of upstarts from the Mile High City found an entertaining way on Tuesday night to win some leaguewide notice. Seemingly headed for a second consecutive playoff defeat to the San Antonio Spurs on its home floor, Denver rode a remarkable fourth-quarter resurrection from the third-year guard Jamal Murray to rally to a 114-105 victory over the Spurs that did far more than even this Western Conference first-round series at one game apiece.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely saved the season,\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Millsap, Denver\xe2\x80\x99s veteran forward, said in a quiet moment at his locker. \xe2\x80\x9cTo go down, 0-2, against the San Antonio Spurs, going into their place, it\xe2\x80\x99s a massacre waiting to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Millsap\xe2\x80\x99s candor conveyed a good chunk of the significance attached to this win, but not all of it. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s eruption for 21 of his 24 points in the final period \xe2\x80\x94 on 8-for-9 shooting after he stood at 0-for-8 through three quarters \xe2\x80\x94 not only gave the hosts hope of making this an actual series but also spared them some real embarrassment and introspection.'
b'After five consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, Denver unexpectedly won 54 games this season to vault to No. 2 in the West. The Nuggets were nonetheless a trendy pick to suffer a first-round upset against the San Antonio masters of execution and their coaching maestro, Gregg Popovich, which would naturally render Denver\xe2\x80\x99s regular-season accomplishments rather hollow.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrauds\xe2\x80\x9d was the popular word being tossed around on N.B.A. Twitter after the Nuggets fell behind by 19 points \xe2\x80\x94 twice \xe2\x80\x94 in a must-win game. Booing broke out at Pepsi Center on multiple occasions in just Denver\xe2\x80\x99s second home playoff game since 2013, with both Jokic and Nuggets Coach Michael Malone telling reporters afterward that the fans were too hard on Will Barton when they hissed at his 1-for-10 shooting.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a tough time, they could use some love,\xe2\x80\x9d Malone said of his players, who comprise the league\xe2\x80\x99s youngest playoff roster.'
b'Fortunately for Barton and the rest of the Nuggets, it was all love in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to Murray, who shot 8-for-24 in Game 1 \xe2\x80\x94 including a wide-open elbow jumper he clanked in crunchtime that clearly haunted the Canadian guard well into Game 2.'
b'During one key timeout, Malone reminded his players \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the Clippers did\xe2\x80\x9d Monday night, when they rallied out of a 31-point deficit in the second half at Golden State to register the largest playoff comeback in N.B.A. history. The inspiration finally hit Murray in the fourth when, without warning, he drained his first eight shots.'
b'In support of Murray, Jokic rang up 21 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists in a bid for a second consecutive triple-double, which would suggest that the Serbian big man is coping quite well with his first turn under a playoff microscope. Gary Harris and Millsap added 23 and 20 points, to give Denver four starters in the 20s.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe gave up 38 points in the fourth quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d said a seething Popovich. \xe2\x80\x9cEnd of story.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The collapse was even worse than Popovich realized. The Spurs actually allowed 39 points in the quarter \xe2\x80\x94 and San Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star forward, LaMarcus Aldridge, could be subjected to some league discipline that affects his status for Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s Game 3 judging by video footage in circulation that appears to show Aldridge landing a below-the-belt shot on Harris.'
b'Not that the Nuggets, after days of hearing incessantly about how inexperienced they are, can feel any sort of comfort yet. They\xe2\x80\x99ve lost 13 consecutive games in San Antonio dating to 2012. Denver is also 0-11, as a franchise, in best-of-seven series after losing Game 1.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the cynicism is fair,\xe2\x80\x9d Nuggets General Manager Tim Connelly said after the victory, acknowledging that he was well aware of the noise about his team.'
b'Yet Connelly pointed out that as fluky as skeptics might find the Nuggets\xe2\x80\x99 No. 2 seed, team officials set three fairly lofty goals before the season started. Then they watched this group, largely assembled through Denver\xe2\x80\x99s own shrewd drafting and trading, reach them all.'
b'End the playoff drought? Check.'
b'Win the Northwest Division? Check.'
b'Secure a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round of the postseason?'
b'Check.'
b'The next step was making sure they didn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil all that by falling into an 0-2 hole to San Antonio with two home defeats, which is the sort of deficit only four teams in league history have managed to erase. Yet one of the more refreshing things about this team is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to pretend that its collective lack of postseason experience is merely a topic harped on by the news media.'
b'The Nuggets have only three players (Millsap, Barton and Mason Plumlee) who appeared in a playoff game before Game 1 of this series, and they acknowledge it\xe2\x80\x99s an obstacle, especially against a team that can carry out a game plan like the Spurs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, playoff basketball is everything everybody says it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Harris told me Monday, on the eve of Game 2.'
b'Breakthrough performances from Murray and Jokic and big comebacks, as such, must be celebrated \xe2\x80\x94 even at this early stage of Round 1.'
b'So in the middle of the victorious locker room, swept up in what the novices, er, the Nuggets had just achieved, Malone was duly pulled into a robust group hug by their rarely seen owner, Stan Kroenke, and Kroenke\xe2\x80\x99s son Josh, the team\xe2\x80\x99s president and governor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Connelly said, \xe2\x80\x9cto watch some young guys grow up tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Cal Ramsey, a presence on the New York basketball scene for more than a half-century, who starred at New York University in the 1950s, played briefly for the Knicks and remained with them as a longtime broadcaster and community relations representative, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 81.'
b'The Knicks announced his death, at a rehabilitation center. He had been in poor health in recent years.'
b'Ramsey, who had lived in Harlem since he was young, began honing his skills on the playground courts of the Rucker League, which has attracted some of the game\xe2\x80\x99s greatest players over the years.'
b'He first appeared at Madison Square Garden while playing for Commerce High School of Manhattan. He played at the Garden for three seasons as a forward at N.Y.U., where he was a teammate of the future Boston Celtic forward Tom Sanders. He is 11th on the leading scorers list for N.Y.U. with 1,275 points.'
b'Ramsey was selected in the second round of the 1959 N.B.A. draft by the St. Louis Hawks. At 6 feet 4 inches, he was an outstanding rebounder with a good shooting touch, but he came to be considered too small as a forward and not good enough as a dribbler to excel at guard.'
b'He played in only four games with the Hawks and seven with the Knicks in the 1959-60 season, then in two games with the Syracuse Nationals, the forerunners of the Philadelphia 76ers, in 1960-61.'
b'Ramsey may have faced another obstacle in the N.B.A. that had little to do with his skills. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been told at the time there was a quota system in the league,\xe2\x80\x9d in which teams \xe2\x80\x9cmay have wanted only two or three blacks,\xe2\x80\x9d Ramsey told Charles Salzberg for the oral history \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Set Shot to Slam Dunk\xe2\x80\x9d (1987).'
b'After Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s stint with Syracuse, he went to the semipro Eastern League but incurred a severe knee injury in his third season with the circuit. It ended his playing career.'
b'Ramsey was born on July 13, 1937, in Selma, Ala. He was a teacher in New York after his playing days, having received a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree from N.Y.U.'
b'He was a color analyst for Knicks broadcasts from 1972 to 1982, then rejoined the team as a community representative in 1991. He was also an assistant basketball coach at N.Y.U., which had become a Division III team, from 1983 until the past season. He served N.Y.U. as assistant director of community relations for 20 years and received the N.Y.U. President\xe2\x80\x99s Alumni Achievement Award in 2004.'
b'Information on his survivors was not immediately available.'
b'James L. Dolan, the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 owner, said in a statement that Ramsey \xe2\x80\x9cwill be remembered for the thousands of young lives he influenced as a community leader.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A case in point involved Al Barden, who, after starring for Boys High School in Brooklyn (now Boys and Girls), was recruited to N.Y.U. by Ramsey while he was playing there.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAl was a tough kid with a habit of getting into some trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d Ramsey told Harvey Araton of The New York Times in 2009. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I stayed on him, made sure he was going to class, doing the things he needed to stay eligible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Barden\xe2\x80\x99s basketball career was over, Ramsey, mindful of the problems athletes have in transitioning to a new phase of life, hired Barden as his replacement to direct a high school program for at-risk students. They remained friends through the years.'
b'One day, Barden, living in California, phoned Ramsey to tell him of the birth of his son, whom he had named Ramses, ostensibly for the pharaohs of ancient Egypt as a symbol of everlasting strength.'
b'But there was more to it than that.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cReplace the \xe2\x80\x98s\xe2\x80\x99 with a \xe2\x80\x98y\xe2\x80\x99 and what does it spell?\xe2\x80\x9d Barden asked Ramsey. \xe2\x80\x9cI really named him for you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In June 2009, the Giants selected Ramses Barden, a receiver from Cal Poly, in the third round of the N.F.L. draft, and he spent four seasons with them.'
b'When Ramses was drafted, Al Barden, speaking to The Times, said of Cal Ramsey, \xe2\x80\x9cHe could get you to do anything just because of who he was: someone you just had to respect.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary misidentified when Ramsey played for the Knicks. As the obituary correctly states, it was the 1959-60 season, not 1960-61.'

b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 In theory at least, we understand the words on the sports radio we hear incessantly \xe2\x80\x94 in taxis, at the fish and chips place, at the corner newsstand. But we are foreigners here and the stories are inscrutable, full of happenings from cricket ovals and rugby pitches.'
b'Our sports focus is confined to our darkened living room, where my 7-year-old son, Leo, and I have lately been absorbing improbable happenings from the other side of the Atlantic \xe2\x80\x94 one exhilarating victory after another for our suddenly mighty Brooklyn Nets.'
b'This has become our early-morning ritual. Wife and daughter still asleep, the boys watch the action from the night before, the scores carefully hidden from our N.B.A. League Pass app lest we ruin the ending.'
b'We are basketball expatriates, two steps removed from the initial source of my N.B.A. obsession by a change of team loyalties and a move to London.'
b'In our North London surroundings, we may as well be rooting for a badminton team from Bhutan. While the odd LeBron James jersey can be spotted, our Brooklyn Nets gear seemingly fades into the sea of Yankees caps brought home by tourists returning from New York (oblivious to the hate they are inspiring from this Mets fan) and the endless Brooklyn-related mumbo jumbo that now adorns T-shirts worldwide.'
b'[Nets\xe2\x80\x99 Run to the Playoffs Hits a Snag With Spencer Dinwiddie Injury]'
b'While N.F.L. gear is a common sighting, owing to the constant staging of American football games here, N.B.A. basketball is largely invisible. One imagines this was unaltered by the recent showdown of two of the league\xe2\x80\x99s most dreadful teams, the Knicks and the Washington Wizards, inside London\xe2\x80\x99s unlovable O2 arena. (We did not attend, just as we do not take leisure trips to see the dentist.)'
b'Our sports-related conversations with Britons tend to revolve around the astronomical ticket prices required to see Arsenal, the English Premier League soccer team Leo has decided that we love forever. Our Nets fandom is like membership in a secret society, whose disclosure would mark us as eccentric and produce puzzlement.'
b'Even my Knick fan friends back in New York do not want to hear about the Nets via email. My only real communion comes via obscure Nets-related podcasts I listen to while washing the dishes. When Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe devoted perhaps 3 minutes of a recent pod to the Nets surge, I confess to feelings of pride and validation I can only liken to a U.F.O. conspiracy theorist hearing that the government is probing the sighting of a flying saucer.'
b'My embrace of the Nets began seven years ago when the Knicks \xe2\x80\x94 the only team I had ever rooted for \xe2\x80\x94 shunned a gift from the basketball gods by letting Jeremy Lin leave town. It was the final indignity after years of atrocious basketball. I dumped my Knicks season tickets and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my Brooklyn neighborhood.'
b'I did not do so lightly. As a born-and-bred New Yorker, I saw abandoning a team as a serious breach of the tribal code. I disdained fans from other cities who rooted for two teams in the same sport. I was unremittingly harsh to the worst transgressor of all: the bandwagon fan. (If that Steph Curry jersey you own was the first Warriors gear in your closet, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about you.)'
b'But I was hopping on no bandwagon. With the exception of a pair of distant trips to the N.B.A. finals, the New Jersey-turned-Brooklyn Nets were a pathetic franchise. I was living in Brooklyn. My father had grown up in Queens and traveled on a streetcar to watch the Dodgers at Ebbets Field. I was not abandoning my tribe. I was returning to it.'
b'This is what I told myself as I began reading about the odd collection of players I was now rooting for, trying to divine the narrative that would make it real. I fought through a sense of exile in the slick, new Barclays Center, which was full of fans for whom the game itself appeared peripheral to the cool Brooklyn food, the dancing during timeouts, and whatever fascinating things were happening on their phones.'
b'Yes, it was a gorgeous arena with excellent sightlines and welcoming staff. The season tickets I bought the day the Knicks said goodbye to J-Lin put me in seats that were a 10-minute walk from my house in Prospect Heights. Madison Square Garden was a cramped dump reached via a creaking subway and a walk through the bowels of Penn Station.'
b'Yet there was something about the Garden, even as the Dolan era yielded a lost decade of basketball. The crowd understood. Hustle plays drew appreciation in an arena that had revered Charles Oakley. The energy was electric.'
b'In Brooklyn, the mostly mercenary fans got what we deserved: a team of past-their-prime castoffs imported by the bombastic Russian magnate, Mikhail Prokhorov, who had brought the franchise to Brooklyn. Vowing to spend whatever it took to eclipse the Knicks \xe2\x80\x94 a low bar \xe2\x80\x94 he built a bonfire of money at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic.'
b'In came the wildly overpaid Joe Johnson, a seven-time All-Star. In came the mediocre Gerald Wallace in exchange for a first-round pick that Portland turned into Damian Lillard. The centerpiece was the sullen, out-of-shape Deron Williams who, in another lifetime, looked like the best point guard on earth, and whose passions no longer appeared to include basketball.'
b'They fit uneasily around the likable 7-footer, Brook Lopez, whose sweet shooting came along with rebounding and defensive skills that seemed better suited for other pursuits, like calligraphy.'
b'My history as a Knicks fan made the plan feel familiar. Win now, baby! The future was for losers. The oligarch was buying his way to competitiveness pronto. Leaving no doubt, the Nets soon traded every first-round pick until the sun dies for the remains of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.'
b'When it all unraveled and the Nets descended into an unwatchable state, I hung in. You can not renounce the team of your life and then walk away from your new one because they are terrible. Real fandom is forged in suffering. Even when my family traded Brooklyn for London in 2016, we remained Nets fans.'
b'This happily coincided with another development: The Nets bucked the conventional wisdom that New York fans will not accept rebuilding and embraced patience.'
b'Sean Marks, the general manager, somehow turned a collection of mostly indifferent veterans into a raffish crew of young, hungry players led by a first-time head coach, Kenny Atkinson. They run at a ferocious pace, share the ball with grace, and play with joy.'
b'Since an excruciating eight-game losing streak, the Nets have won 18 of 23. Even from afar, we can tell that the intensity has changed at the Barclays, the Brooook-Lyyyyn chants filling our London living room.'
b'And still, an intense New York team deserves better. Back for the holidays, I took Leo to see New Orleans and their marquee star, Anthony Davis, at Barclays. The place was packed with tourists who seemed intent on taking selfies and buying Brooklyn gear at the swag shop.'
b'Whatever.'
b'On Saturday morning, we will sit on the couch in our pajamas, Leo and me, and see what happened against the now-hated, if pitiful, Knicks the night before.'
b'Please don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us who won.'

b'Louisiana State suspended its head men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach, Will Wade, on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 less than two weeks before the N.C.A.A. tournament is set to begin \xe2\x80\x94 after a report that Wade made damning remarks to a recruiting middleman on a phone call that was wiretapped as part of a federal corruption investigation.'
b'Wade spoke with Christian Dawkins, who was convicted of fraud last year for his connection in a scheme to funnel money to the families of basketball recruits, in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. In the conversation, according to a report on Thursday by Yahoo Sports, Wade was heard boasting in colorful language that he had made a strong offer to one recruit but that he had not yet committed because someone else in his life was not getting \xe2\x80\x9cenough piece of the pie in the deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A source with knowledge of the call, who declined to be identified because the trial is continuing, confirmed the report on Friday.'
b'The No. 10 Tigers (25-5) are having their best season in decades and are considered shoo-ins for an N.C.A.A. tournament bid. They host Vanderbilt on Saturday night before next week\xe2\x80\x99s Southeastern Conference tournament in Nashville.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us at L.S.U. share the obligation to protect the integrity of this institution,\xe2\x80\x9d said the university\xe2\x80\x99s president, F. King Alexander, and its athletic director, Joe Alleva, in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cAs such, we have suspended Head Coach Will Wade indefinitely until such time as we can ensure full compliance with the N.C.A.A., as well as institutional policies and standards.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Alexander and Alleva pledged full cooperation with the N.C.A.A. and said an assistant coach, Tony Benford, would be interim head coach.'
b'When confronted with the report on Thursday by a local television station, Wade declined to comment.'
b'Dawkins was convicted of fraud after a trial last year, alongside Jim Gatto, the former director of global sports marketing for Adidas, and Merl Code Jr., who had also worked for Adidas. After a yearslong investigation involving a cooperating witness, undercover agents and wiretaps, prosecutors said the men had conspired to funnel Adidas money to the family of a top basketball player who would play for Louisville, one of the most prominent teams the apparel giant sponsors.'
b'But prosecutors also accused Dawkins and Code of involvement in bribing assistant coaches at top programs. In a trial set to begin next month, three assistant coaches have pleaded guilty, but Dawkins and Code are also defendants and, following sentencing in the first trial on Tuesday, their lawyers pledged to fight prosecutors on the facts and summon college coaches to testify.'
b'When the charges were first announced, in September 2017, they swiftly led to the firings of Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director and Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino. Several assistant coaches charged also lost their jobs. Arizona Coach Sean Miller was suspended for a game after a report that he was on tape discussing with Dawkins the payment of $100,000 to a top recruit, but he and the university denied the charge and he was reinstated. Evidence at last year\xe2\x80\x99s trial indicated that Miller did have phone calls with Dawkins.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe information in recent news reports is very disturbing, if true,\xe2\x80\x9d the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, said in a statement on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering the existing circumstances, L.S.U. has taken appropriate action today while the investigation continues.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Nathaniel Butler has been an N.B.A. senior photographer since 1984. Those were the days of shooting on film and developing photos in hotel rooms after games. Today, players text Butler as they arrive at the arena so he can be in position to capture a perfect arena entrance shot for them to post on Instagram.'
b'The job isn\xe2\x80\x99t what it used to be.'
b'When Andrew D. Bernstein became an official N.B.A. photographer in 1986, he was continually thwarted in his attempts to get his camera into in-game huddles to capture the interactions between players and coaches. Pat Riley, who was the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, made sure to obscure all viewpoints.'
b'Halfway through the season, Riley asked Bernstein why he wanted to be in the huddle. People want to see what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the inside, Bernstein told Riley, who agreed to give Bernstein a chance. If you screw up, Riley said, you are never coming back.'
b'More than three decades later, Bernstein is still photographing N.B.A. players, huddles and pretty much whatever he pleases as the league\xe2\x80\x99s longest tenured senior photographer.'
b'Photographers have long played a critical role in shaping narratives in a league defined by faces and moments. The most iconic posters are the finished works of the photographers who position themselves along the baseline each game, often contorting their bodies and forgetting about personal comfort to get closer and take countless snaps, in hopes of capturing a masterpiece.'
b'In today\xe2\x80\x99s N.B.A., they allow players to use those photographs as building blocks for their social media profiles. They have adapted to an ever-changing digital world that has presented new opportunities and a whole new set of challenges.'
b'On game day, Butler uses a combination of tethered remotes and custom phone apps to operate any number of cameras in an arena.'
b'He sends photographs to a team of editors in Secaucus, N.J., with the press of a button. In seconds, they can be published on the league\xe2\x80\x99s official social media feeds and reach millions of people around the world.'
b'Despite the technological advances, shooting an N.B.A. game can be more difficult than one would think. \xe2\x80\x9cA basketball game is a complex situation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce Ely, the lead photographer of the Portland Trail Blazers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of moving parts.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Like a fan\xe2\x80\x99s arms waving across the frame just as Damian Lillard makes a 3-pointer. Or the leg of another player sneaking into the edge of the image, ruining a portrait. Another time, it might be a referee walking into a perfect shot.'
b'Despite the challenges, some N.B.A. photographers do not consider it their most difficult assignment. Nelson Campana, who photographs the Raptors as an employee of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns the team, regularly shoots weddings as well. The pressure of game night is nothing compared with the responsibility of chronicling a couple\xe2\x80\x99s special day.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one night to make it right,\xe2\x80\x9d Campana said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a list of things you need to get, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get another chance. At a basketball game, you\xe2\x80\x99re just hoping things happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Some nights, there is too much happening at the same time. As the Oklahoma City Thunder eliminated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2016 playoffs, Butler had to make a split-second decision about what to photograph at the buzzer. He focused on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook embracing, and then got a shot of Durant with Tim Duncan. He stayed with Durant afterward, but that meant missing a chance to capture Duncan walking off an N.B.A. court for the final time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIdeally,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to be in two places at one time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'While some players enjoy being on the other side of these photographers\xe2\x80\x99 lenses, others say it is an adjustment. Aaron Gordon of the Orlando Magic first remembers being in front of a camera as a high schooler being interviewed after winning a basketball tournament.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to live in a way where you\xe2\x80\x99re O.K. with being seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Gordon said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always being watched these days.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Because so many photos are being taken, players have to accept that they can control only so much of what is shared online.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou want to nitpick every single picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Collins, a second-year forward with the Atlanta Hawks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it just can\xe2\x80\x99t work that way. You can\xe2\x80\x99t read everything about yourself and see every photo of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To take more control over their visual narratives on social media, players are working with photographers to shoot them outside basketball arenas.'
b'Cassy Athena is a professional photographer who has earned the trust of players around the league. Last season, at All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Athena followed Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha, for the entire weekend. She was also invited by Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo to shoot him at New York Fashion Week in 2018.'
b'Athena says it takes time to convince certain players of the value of her photographs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so much they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the importance of the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s convincing them why they should share it with the world. When it clicks, you get guys who might not be the best N.B.A. player, but they use this\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning Instagram and professional photos \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cto build their own brand and further their careers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Older, more established players worry less about their online persona but more about how the images carry a nostalgic value as their careers wind down.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat photographers do may seem minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vince Carter, 42, who just ended his 21st season in the league. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so many shots of the best moments of my career, and in some ways, they\xe2\x80\x99ve helped me remember those moments.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Many of these iconic images can now be seen on the Instagram pages of the photographers themselves. Bernstein said he was the last guy dragged kicking and screaming into the social media era. He now enjoys posting classic pictures for Throwback Thursday.'
b'Butler adds watermarks to the photographs he posts on his feed because other accounts and publications will often publish them without giving him credit. But he recognizes the value of being online. \xe2\x80\x9cIt opens you up to a whole other audience,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said.'
b'The rise of social media accounts means there are now more photographers at N.B.A. games. Butler prefers to use a camera lens that does not require him to be right in the face of players to capture them up close. In the modern era, he has noticed a lot of camera phones being shoved into players\xe2\x80\x99 faces.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an etiquette that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot just in sports, but in society.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Even though photographers want to capture every moment, some also realize that there are boundaries. A few months ago, Kyrie Irving and Durant had a private conversation at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, N.C., which was captured on film. It was circulated online, and many believed the two were discussing their heavily rumored plans to join the Knicks together this summer.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was a player, that would bother me,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to document every second of their existence.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Bernstein had a similar decision to make more than 30 years ago, during the 1988 N.B.A. finals, when he walked through the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 locker room after a loss and found Magic Johnson and Michael Cooper with their uniforms on, dejected as the showers were running around them.'
b'It was a one-of-a-kind moment, but Bernstein opted against taking the photograph.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was their time,\xe2\x80\x9d Bernstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be documented. I have that picture in my mind, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An earlier version of this article described Nelson Campana\xe2\x80\x99s job incorrectly. He photographs the Toronto Raptors as an employee of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns the team; he is not the team photographer.'

b'An Alabama girl\xe2\x80\x99s banishment from high school basketball came to an end on Friday morning when a circuit court judge accomplished what appeals to state boards and outcries from some of the most prominent voices in sports could not.'
b'After the parents of Maori Davenport filed a motion on Thursday to get their daughter back on the basketball court, Judge Sonny Reagan of Pike County Circuit Court ruled that Davenport could return to competition pending a hearing. He will decide whether she deserved to be ruled ineligible for accepting a mistaken payment from the sport\xe2\x80\x99s national governing body for playing on a junior national team last summer.'
b'The effect will be almost immediate. Davenport, 18, a star forward at Charles Henderson High School in Troy, Ala., was set to play with her team on Friday night against Carroll High School.'
b'Last season, Davenport averaged 18.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.2 blocks a game in leading Charles Henderson to the Alabama Class 5A state title. The year before, in a losing effort in the state title game, she had 20 points and 25 rebounds and swatted away 19 shots, an Alabama state record. She has committed to play at Rutgers.'
b'Her athletic eligibility became a cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre in the past week. On Nov. 30, Davenport, a 6-foot-4 forward, was called into her principal\xe2\x80\x99s office and told that the Alabama High School Athletic Association had ruled her ineligible for one year, her senior season.'
b'The suspension was not for poor grades or unsportsmanlike conduct. It was because of a clerical error that U.S.A. Basketball, the sport\xe2\x80\x99s national governing body, readily admitted to having made, and the decision to suspend her became one of the more mind-boggling stories for those who follow amateur sports.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was very heartbreaking for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Davenport said this week of the suspension. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I could think is that I was in shock and devastated.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The trouble began harmlessly enough over the summer, when Davenport represented the United States at the FIBA Under-18 Women\xe2\x80\x99s Americas Championship in Mexico City. She led the team in rebounding and blocks as it won gold.'
b'U.S.A. Basketball compensates players who compete on national teams to make up for wages they could have earned working summer jobs rather than practicing or competing. The N.C.A.A. allows college athletes to accept those payments. It calls them broken-time payments.'
b'For players with high school eligibility remaining, U.S.A. Basketball typically inquires with individual state high school athletics associations to see if the payments can be accepted. Policies can vary by state.'
b'In this case, because of what Craig Miller, a spokesman for U.S.A. Basketball, termed a clerical error, nobody checked with the state high school athletic associations for the three players on the under-18 team with high school eligibility remaining. U.S.A. Basketball sent checks for $857.20 to Davenport and every other player on the team. On Aug. 27, Mario Davenport, Maori\xe2\x80\x99s father, received it. Two days later, she cashed it.'
b'Two months later, U.S.A. Basketball realized the error. In November, an employee called the Alabama athletics association, which told the U.S.A. Basketball employee that under Alabama rules, athletes could accept broken-time payments only if the value was less than $200. On Nov. 26, a U.S.A. Basketball official called Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Tara Davenport, and informed her that Maori was not allowed to accept the stipend. The next day, Tara Davenport reported the violation to the state association and informed Charles Henderson High School officials, and on Nov. 28 she repaid U.S.A. Basketball.'
b'Two days later, the state ruled Davenport ineligible for the rest of the season. Two appeals boards have upheld the ruling.'
b'On Wednesday afternoon, Tara Davenport said she hoped attention from the news media, as well as pressure from Alabama politicians, would convince the association to change the ruling. The Alabama House Republican Caucus unanimously approved a resolution supporting Maori Davenport, and its members were among the many local politicians supporting her. If the association\xe2\x80\x99s officials were unwilling to change their ruling, Tara Davenport was prepared to take the next step.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we are definitely going to take some legal action to try to help get her on the court,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The next day, she and Mario Davenport filed a lawsuit in Pike County Circuit Court seeking their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement.'
b'Since Maori Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s final appeal was denied in December, attention and pressure had been building.'
b'The story gained national attention recently after Jay Bilas, an ESPN college basketball analyst who was once called \xe2\x80\x9cthe N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous critic,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote a column blistering Steve Savarese, the executive director for the state athletic association. Bilas accused Savarese of \xe2\x80\x9cblindly asserting authority without regard for whom it may hurt, or the reasonable likelihood of a similar issue recurring in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d On Thursday, the tennis legend Billie Jean King joined the N.B.A. star DeMarcus Cousins and a chorus of others in voicing their support for the player.'
b'The association did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, and earlier in the week it declined to make Savarese available for an interview. On Tuesday, Johnny Hardin, the president of the association\xe2\x80\x99s Central Board of Control \xe2\x80\x94 which heard and denied Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s final appeal \xe2\x80\x94 released a statement asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cfacts involved in the ruling have either been misstated or ignored.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'According to Brock Kelley, the Charles Henderson High School principal, it is the association\xe2\x80\x99s facts that are misleading.'
b'Hardin\xe2\x80\x99s statement says that Tara Davenport is a certified basketball coach and therefore should know the eligibility rules. Kelley wrote in an email that Tara Davenport, who is a fifth-grade teacher, coaches middle school basketball, for which there is no rules test. Hardin\xe2\x80\x99s statement says Kelley has not attended an association rules conference for the past three years. Kelley wrote that his school\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director had attended each one and that the amateurism rule had not been covered at the last meeting.'
b'Tara Davenport emphasized that neither she nor her daughter had hidden the check. They simply thought that U.S.A. Basketball had done its due diligence and that they could accept it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI reported it as soon as I knew that Maori wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to have it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'Kelley, the high school principal, and Miller, the U.S.A. Basketball spokesman, focused on how institutionalized the payments are. After U.S.A. Basketball sent the check but before Tara Davenport received it, Kelley wrote, she received a call from Jeff Walz. Walz is the women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at the University of Louisville and was also the coach of the United States under-18 team. Walz asked Tara Davenport if she had received the check yet. She said she had not and asked whether Maori could accept it. Walz told her that she was allowed to and that it was permitted by the N.C.A.A.'
b'Louisville officials did not respond to a request to comment.'
b'In Maori Davenport\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the Charles Henderson girls basketball team has won all but two games and is the top-ranked 5A team in the state. Davenport is attending school, going to practices and working on her game with an outside trainer. She said she was focusing on ball-handling skills and other drills that would allow her to play more as a wing.'
b'On Friday night, she will get her first opportunity to show off those newly developed skills in a competitive game.'

b'Sometime in the third quarter, as the Philadelphia 76ers rained down 3-pointers like mortar shots and Ben Simmons, a giant point guard possessed of preternatural passing ability and a bricklayer\xe2\x80\x99s touch, carved through the Nets, a thought occurred:'
b'This was not the playoff homecoming of the Nets\xe2\x80\x99 dreams.'
b'The Nets tried but never really contended Thursday night. The men from Philadelphia simply had too much talent and too many big bodies on their way to a 2-1 first-round series lead, and that was a shame. Saddled with the worst attendance in the N.B.A. this season, Barclays Center in Brooklyn was packed to the gills with fans waving towels and hooting and yelling. The joint was packed and joyfully rocking.'
b'The Nets are a pretty good pro hoops team in a city where terrible often rules the roost. Their coach, Kenny Atkinson, a likable and intelligent basketball lifer, took over a team that was expected to dwell in the cellar and won more games, 42, than it lost, 40, this season.'
b'That was in contrast to the disaster masquerading as a basketball team at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 management team crafted a grotesquely bad team that finished 17-65. (Losing no longer impresses because the Knicks have posted losing records in 15 of the last 18 years.) In a sign that God may have a strange sense of humor, those same Knicks are widely rumored to be a favorite to gain the services of the brilliant forward Kevin Durant, who can become a free agent this summer.'
b'But enough about that other New York team.'
b'After falling into a deep ditch under previous management, the Brooklyn Nets have executed a slow, steady rebuild, instilling discipline and a sense of Nets basketball, which is to say a fluid, slashing style that relies on small forwards and guards bolstered by lean, swift centers who block shots and rebound and run. Their general manager, Sean Marks, a former San Antonio Spurs assistant and executive, has picked up talented role players much as a fishmonger sorts through a barrel and plucks out tasty sea bass.'
b'The Nets have a fine quartet of guards and small forwards, D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Caris LeVert, creative players all, who can probe and find seams in defenses and stroke jump shots.'
b'So this game on Thursday offered a chance to draw the measure of a Nets team rising more quickly than expected and of a Sixers team that hopes to compete for a championship. On that last point I walked away nursing doubts.'
b'The Sixers for six years were an experimental laboratory, their former general manager Sam Hinkie occupying a reputational land between supposed genius and madman. They lost intentionally and insistently, and accumulated top draft picks, not the least the 6-foot-10 point guard Simmons and the splendidly talented big man Joel Embiid. Sixers ownership eventually discarded Hinkie. But that team now is expected to contend, and the current general manager made a series of trades toward that end this season.'
b'Yet a week into playoff season, the engine of that 76ers machine is coughing. Embiid has come up with a chronically sore knee. That is a problem for any athlete, much less a 7-foot, 270-pound center. The assumption Thursday night was that he would play, an impression reinforced when Embiid took the court an hour before the game and shot around. He shot fadeaways and spun like a dervish and put up graceful hook shots.'
b'Then minutes before tipoff, the 76ers\xe2\x80\x99 coaches shook their heads. Nope, his knee was too sore. Embiid was sitting. That left the big man in a bad mood. Moments before the tip, as teammates walked over to dap him up and slap his back, Embiid could barely look at them or the court.'
b'Simmons is no less talented, and perhaps more baffling. He is a brilliant athlete with stunning vision and dribbling ability. When he breaks swiftly into the open court, his passing takes on a sleight-of-hand quality, so quick that you notice the ball only as it lands in the hands of a teammate.'
b'Alas, his shooting edges toward disastrous, and his confidence in it is sodden. Rather than put his hand under the ball, he puts it off to the side, his left elbow sticking out like a chicken wing. He practices his shooting before games with often unsightly results. On Thursday evening, he stood in the corner and took pass after pass from an assistant coach and shot and shot. He made, by my count, five baskets in 15 attempts. Then he took 3-point shots from the shoulder of the key, going 1 for 6.'
b'You wanted to cover your eyes and suggest that maybe he should stick to layups. Yet by shooting layups and hook shots and dunks, he finished the game with 31 points and 9 assists.'
b'He is the best fundamentally unsound player in the N.B.A. And you wonder how this still unformed 22-year-old star and a gimpy-knee center can stumble into the N.B.A. finals.'
b'In a strange way, on this night, Embiid\xe2\x80\x99s absence liberated his teammates. They shot 40 percent from 3-point range to the Nets\xe2\x80\x99 20 percent, and they outrebounded them, too.'
b'If the 76ers have a playoff advantage, it may reside with their veteran talent, in particular Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler and J.J. Redick. During a Nets run late in the third quarter, Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown called a timeout and drew up a play. Then you saw Redick stand up and start talking and pointing. Then Butler leaned in and interjected. Brown fell silent, then nodded in agreement. Fine, he said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll run it differently.'
b'As they walked out onto the court after the timeout, Butler and Redick kept talking, resembling two professors discussing a knotty physics problem. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was pros talking to pros,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown said later.'
b'The Nets are a young crew, not unduly burdened by egos and attitude. But they are not yet at a pros-talking-to-pros level. They are a promising troupe still in search of a leading man.'

b'The woman who has accused Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant governor, Justin E. Fairfax, of raping her said that a former N.B.A. player, Corey Maggette, raped her at Duke University 20 years ago and that school officials did not pursue the claim, according to a childhood friend of the woman and Facebook messages the woman exchanged with another friend.'
b'Mr. Maggette, who attended Duke for one year, 1998-99, and reached the national championship game, played in the N.B.A. until 2013 and has since worked as a television analyst for Fox Sports.'
b'Mr. Maggette denied the accusation through a spokesman Monday evening. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has only been through media accounts and a statement from Meredith Watson\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer that I first learned or heard of anything about these sexual assault allegations,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Maggette said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A spokeswoman for Fox Sports West, where Mr. Maggette is a basketball analyst, said in an email, \xe2\x80\x9cFox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter. We have no further comment at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer for the woman who accused Mr. Maggette and Mr. Fairfax, Meredith Watson, said in a statement Friday that Ms. Watson had been raped by a Duke basketball player during her sophomore year but did not name the player. Ms. Smith also said that Ms. Watson had reported her rape to an unspecified dean at the university, but that the dean had \xe2\x80\x9cdiscouraged her from pursuing the claim further.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Duke has acknowledged it is investigating an allegation that a player raped the woman, but a spokesman for the university declined to comment on the identity of the player or the assertion that the university failed to act on the accusation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for Duke. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Years before Ms. Watson came forward as the second woman to publicly accuse Mr. Fairfax of sexual assault, inflaming a political crisis in Virginia, she told multiple friends that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette, according to one of those friends and Facebook messages exchanged with another.'
b'R. Stanton Jones, a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington who grew up with Ms. Watson in Baltimore, said she told him that she had been raped by Mr. Maggette. She told Mr. Jones about it while he and Ms. Watson were both home for the summer in 2001, he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMeredith told me she had been raped twice at Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she told me that one of the men who raped her was the Duke basketball player Corey Maggette. That was a name I knew because I\xe2\x80\x99m a basketball fan.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Mr. Jones, who did not attend Duke, said he had not had much contact with Ms. Watson in the last decade \xe2\x80\x9cother than occasionally liking a Facebook post.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he was coming forward now because it \xe2\x80\x9cseemed like the right thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The longtime coach of Duke\xe2\x80\x99s men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team, Mike Krzyzewski, said after his team\xe2\x80\x99s victory against Virginia on Saturday night that he had \xe2\x80\x9cno knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d of the situation and that he had learned of it only from news media reports Friday.'
b'Karen Kessler, a spokeswoman for Ms. Watson, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from March 2017. Ms. Kessler declined to identify the friend, whose name was blacked out in the messages, and The Times was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the messages.'
b'In the messages, Ms. Watson expressed disgust at a newspaper article written about Mr. Fairfax, who had already announced his bid for lieutenant governor. After the friend asked Ms. Watson whether she had reported the rape, Ms. Watson responded: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t report it after how the university responded when I reported Corey Maggette.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ms. Kessler said that after being discouraged by the dean, Ms. Watson decided not to report her accusation to the police.'
b'Mr. Krzyzewski \xe2\x80\x94 who is in his 39th season coaching the Blue Devils and is college basketball\xe2\x80\x99s leader in wins \xe2\x80\x94 and Duke have held themselves up not only as consummate winners but as moral exemplars.'
b'No Duke player under Mr. Krzyzewski was kicked off the team until early 2015, when a player was dismissed for unspecified struggles to meet \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d The university\xe2\x80\x99s student newspaper, The Duke Chronicle, reported that the player, Rasheed Sulaimon, had been accused of sexual assault by two students, allegations the athletics department had been aware of as early as 10 months before terminating his participation with the team. (Sulaimon was not charged, and later played for Maryland.)'

b'He had become \xe2\x80\x98that guy,\xe2\x80\x99 the player left wide open during pickup basketball. So he enlisted the help of his 10-year-old son\xe2\x80\x99s coach.'

b'I was 8 years old when my parents \xe2\x80\x94 both graduate students from India \xe2\x80\x94 moved from married student housing to a little home in Raleigh, N.C., with a basketball hoop in the backyard. Even as an immigrant from South Asia, I knew what that hoop meant.'
b'Basketball is a religion in North Carolina, and I quickly became a disciple. When I was 11, the N.C. State Wolfpack won the N.C.A.A. championship in heart-stopping fashion. I still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed by the sheer size and emotion of it.'
b'My love for the game soon became an obsession. I taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kids. I learned to make up for my disadvantages on the court \xe2\x80\x94 both real (I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely undersized) and perceived (no one expected a short Indian kid to be any good) \xe2\x80\x94 through hustle and perfecting a low left-handed heave that I used whenever I could beat my man into the lane.'
b'My crowning achievement came in the final seconds of a Little League championship game, when I went to the free-throw line with my team down a point. Both shots clanked around the rim but went in.'
b'In college, watching the sport became equally addictive \xe2\x80\x94 especially now that I was at UNC-Chapel Hill. My senior year, the Tar Heels won their fourth N.C.A.A. Championship.'
b'Now, at age 47, I am a New York City dad who watches Carolina basketball obsessively with his three sons and who, after a 15 year hiatus (thanks to a couple of knee surgeries) decided to play pickup again. But on the court recently, I came to a shocking realization.'
b'My ugly but effective left-handed heave was no longer effective. I had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaves open from a distance.'
b'Call it ego, but I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be that guy. So I turned to the only expert I knew \xe2\x80\x94 my 10-year-old son\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach.'
b'Macky Bergman, 35, runs Steady Buckets, a nonprofit that teaches more than 1,000 boys and girls from around the city. Coach Macky, as everyone calls him, is a product of New York City basketball \xe2\x80\x94 he was a star player at Bronx Science and played four years at the University of Rochester. He assured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time in.'
b'But could a middle-aged, undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player again?'
b'Coach Macky and I met in early October on a typical outdoor court \xe2\x80\x94 fenced-in blacktop, metal backboards, rims with no nets \xe2\x80\x94 on Second Avenue and 19th Street. It was 8 a.m. on a weekday, so the place was vacant, except for a grousing tenant who lived near the court and asked us to practice as far away from his home as possible. This somewhat safe space meant I could relax a little, although the pressure was still on, as both Macky and the Times photographer, sent to track my progress, were both former college players.'
b'We began with a shooting test: a series of midrange and 3-point jumpers while moving between five spots on the court. I did this 10 times, shooting 10 free throws after each round. By the end I was drenched in sweat.'
b'The results weren\xe2\x80\x99t great \xe2\x80\x94 62 percent from the free-throw line, 49 percent on 2-point jumpers and an abysmal 30 percent from the 3-point line. As for my self-taught shooting technique, which even my son, Kavi, had described as \xe2\x80\x9cpretty ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Macky decided we would have to start over from scratch.'
b'In our first few sessions, we set about erasing the muscle memory of 1983 to develop proper form. We started as close to the basket as possible \xe2\x80\x94 almost directly under the rim.'
b'The ball was to be perched just above my eyes, on the fingertips of my left hand, directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow. My guide hand would hold the right side of the ball.'
b'For my lower body: knees bent, feet shoulder-width apart, weight on the balls of my feet. Then I was to push the ball up \xe2\x80\x94 not out \xe2\x80\x94 release and follow through, fingers pointed down.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn the follow-through, Kobe sometimes joins his thumb and index finger, and his guide hand points at the basket,\xe2\x80\x9d Macky would say. \xe2\x80\x9cSteph Curry\xe2\x80\x99s guide hand flips out and his arms come together.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The more shots I took \xe2\x80\x94 the goal was 100 baskets in a row \xe2\x80\x94 the more I could feel myself adapting. Set, shoot, follow-through. Take one step forward and catch the ball as it comes through the net. Repeat. It was surprisingly meditative. Before I knew it, I had made it all the way to 88 shots in a row.'
b'But Macky had identified some weaknesses.'
b'For one, I was landing with one leg practically a foot in front of the other. Macky had me stick a soccer ball between my legs and practice a series of jump shots while squeezing it between my knees.'
b'This was surprisingly hard \xe2\x80\x94 either I\xe2\x80\x99d brick the shot, or the soccer ball would pop out \xe2\x80\x94 until I focused on taking really small jumps, landing like I was on train tracks. Kavi even sort of complimented me, calling this an \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced drill\xe2\x80\x9d that only the teenagers do.'
b'Coach Macky encouraged me to attend his weekly shooting clinic at a high school on the Lower East Side with about two dozen of his other students. They were all between 8 and 14 years old, including my son.'
b'I tried to blend in by standing with the coaches. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long. When Macky assigned me to work with one of them, Torrence Ested, the first thing Coach Torrence said to me was, \xe2\x80\x9cI got you old man.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When I asked Kavi who he thought was more embarrassed by the whole venture \xe2\x80\x94 me or him \xe2\x80\x94 his vague reply spoke volumes. \xe2\x80\x9cTough to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded.'
b'For the final lessons, Coach Macky moved me out to the 3-point line. I\xe2\x80\x99d never been comfortable shooting the three. Because my old jump shot was a heave that began at the chest, it was all arms and no legs.'
b'As it turned out, I\xe2\x80\x99d been learning how to be a better 3-point shooter all along. Proper technique and good arc make for a more accurate shot, regardless of distance.'
b'The difference was clear in my final set of drills. I shot above 70 percent from the free throw line, 65 percent on my two pointers, and a remarkably improved 55 percent from 3-point range.'
b'But improving my stats was never really the point. I\xe2\x80\x99ve started hooping again at the McBurney YMCA on West 14th Street and reconnecting with the sport I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved since I was a kid practicing in the backyard. My jumper is still a work in progress, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not being left wide open on it anymore.'
b'At a recent pickup session \xe2\x80\x94 with adults, this time \xe2\x80\x94 I was shooting for the last spot in the next game and was matched against the best shooter in our group. We both made our first two free throws, but on the third shot his bounced out. Mine found the bottom of the net.'
b'Not quite the Little League championship game, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.'

b'As Nets guard Joe Harris walks the cobblestone streets outside the team\xe2\x80\x99s practice facility in Sunset Park, no one seems to notice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the time, I blend in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI kind of look like I work in a Brooklyn coffee shop.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Harris\xe2\x80\x99s journey from unemployed castoff to indispensable starter mirrors the rise of the Nets, a team reconstructed through savvy draft picks and second-chance signings. Without a marquee star, the Nets have won 19 of their last 25 games, and they are on a six-game winning streak against opponents in the stronger Western Conference.'
b'The Nets had 28 victories last season; now, despite a loss in Boston on Monday, they have the sixth-best record in the Eastern Conference (27-24), and playoff talk is brewing. The injury-riddled team has weathered the loss of Caris LeVert, out with a foot injury since November, and now is without Spencer Dinwiddie, a strong candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year Award, who may be out until mid-March with a thumb injury. In Dinwiddie\xe2\x80\x99s absence, the next-man-up Nets will look to G League call-ups and increased scoring from everyone.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI almost look at Joe as one of the poster boys for the Brooklyn Nets,\xe2\x80\x9d the veteran DeMarre Carroll said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came in, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really guaranteed his first year, got on the team, worked his butt off. Each year, he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten better; his numbers, his play, his confidence proves it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Three years ago, Harris, then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, had the worst day of his basketball life. In a period of a few hours, he had foot surgery, was traded to Orlando and was immediately waived. He was out of the league for six months before the Nets signed him to a minimum contract for less than $1 million in 2016. Last summer, he signed a two-year, $16 million deal to remain with the Nets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis story is about opportunity and development on a team starting to improve,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Kenny Atkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cGiven where he came from, it\xe2\x80\x99s a romantic story, a beautiful story. Everything about him \xe2\x80\x94 his humility, the fact that he rides the subway everywhere \xe2\x80\x94 is why everybody loves Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Harris\xe2\x80\x99s romance with the game began in Chelan, Wash., where his father coached high school basketball. In fourth grade, Harris came home one afternoon and asked his mother if he could write his basketball goals on his bedroom walls. She assumed he would scribble them on paper and tape them up. Instead, he took a marker and wrote directly on the walls and ceiling. The writings remain in his childhood bedroom, frozen in the amber of a 9-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s penmanship.'
b'Given that Chelan is a small town with only two gyms, the worst time of the year was when the courts were being refinished, leaving Harris nowhere to play. One time after an interminable wait, a 10-year-old Harris ran onto the court, slid on his stomach and kissed the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cBaby, I\xe2\x80\x99m back!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat pretty much sums me up as a kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Harris said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just love basketball.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To the right of his childhood bed is his favorite quotation from John Wooden, which he easily recites from memory: \xe2\x80\x9cSuccess is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing that you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There are also lines from Charles Barkley, Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and others, as well as a list of goals. The last goal on the list: \xe2\x80\x9cBecome a pro.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After playing four years at Virginia, Harris was drafted in the second round by Cleveland in 2014. He played sparingly for two seasons on the LeBron James-led Cavaliers. A few months after he was released, he watched Cleveland win its first N.B.A. title.'
b'This season, Harris was averaging 13.4 points a game through Sunday and had the third-best 3-point shooting percentage in the N.B.A. (46.8 percent). Among players with at least 300 field-goal attempts this season, he was eighth at 61.4 in effective field-goal percentage, trailing only Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Curry (62.1) among guards and wing players, according to Basketball-Reference.com.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe want him to shoot more bad shots because he\xe2\x80\x99s such a great shooter, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t because he\xe2\x80\x99s such a good guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Atkinson said.'
b'The pace-and-space era of the N.B.A. has made a player like Harris, a sharpshooter who creates space on the floor and strikes when opportunity arises, more valuable.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe game has slowed down for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Atkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cHis first two years he was making turnovers, not reading situations right. He used to be a defensive liability, and now we put him sometimes on the best shooter.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that he\xe2\x80\x99s played beyond his contract. For a guy who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even in the league, he became a stalwart, a guy you can count on.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Casual sports fans may struggle to name a player on the Nets, particularly one who is a regular \xe2\x80\xa6 well, Joe. The team shot an amusing video spoofing Harris\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy in hopes of earning him a spot in the All-Star 3-point shooting contest.'
b'Harris visited spots around Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94 he tossed oranges into a shopping cart, lofted eggs into a hot frying pan and shot some coins into a tip jar.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJoey Buckets! He deserves to be in the contest,\xe2\x80\x9d Carroll said when asked about his teammate. Throughout games, Harris is serenaded \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cJo-ey Buck-ets\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 by the superfans in the Brooklyn Brigade section of Barclays Center. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of many nicknames. Others include Lumber Joe and Beef Jerky Joe.'
b'Beef Jerky Joe? \xe2\x80\x9cLike the Sasquatch from the commercial,\xe2\x80\x9d Harris said with a laugh.'
b'Though Harris has blended into Brooklyn, in truth he is an accidental hipster. On a walk to the Food Hall at the Industry City development in Sunset Park, he was wearing black because it just happens to be the Nets\xe2\x80\x99 team color. His slightly slouchy knit cap was pulled low to fight the chilly gusts from the Brooklyn waterfront. The lumberjack beard was a remnant of a no-shave off-season.'
b'Every Nets player except Jared Dudley lives in Brooklyn, a throwback to when the Dodgers were Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s team and the players raised their children in the borough and car-pooled to Ebbets Field.'
b'Harris walks to Barclays Center on game days. After practices, Atkinson frequently sees him with his backpack, headed to the subway.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe signed a big contract; you\xe2\x80\x99d think he\xe2\x80\x99d get a car service,\xe2\x80\x9d Atkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s him, and that\xe2\x80\x99s us. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a little success, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still humble.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the Food Hall, there\xe2\x80\x99s everything a local might expect, like Korean comfort food and an all-avocado restaurant. Harris stopped for a cup of \xe2\x80\xa6 well, you know. Not a nitro, cold brew or pour over, mind you.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d the barista asked Harris.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBlack,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'In his two years as president of basketball operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson presided over a team as chaotic and playoff-free as the one he\xe2\x80\x99d inherited.'
b'The Lakers succeeded in stockpiling talent \xe2\x80\x94 including the franchise-altering signing of LeBron James \xe2\x80\x94 but failed in putting together complementary pieces, or attracting the second major star Johnson openly said he was chasing.'
b'[Magic Johnson stunned the basketball world by suddenly stepping down on Tuesday.]'
b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a look back at Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s high and low points while running the team.'
b'In February 2017, four seasons into the team\xe2\x80\x99s longest-ever playoff drought, the Lakers reshuffled their front office by firing the general manager, Mitch Kupchak, and installing Johnson as its president. Less than a month later, Rob Pelinka, a longtime agent, was hired as the general manager, reporting to Johnson.'
b'Officially and unofficially, Johnson had remained tied to the team since he retired in 1996. He owned a share of the team from 1994 to 2010, and after that he was an honorary vice president \xe2\x80\x94 a title the team took away from him after he violated the league\xe2\x80\x99s tampering rules by tweeting about free agents.'
b'Three weeks before he was hired in his new role, he had returned to the Lakers as an adviser to Jeanie Buss, the team\xe2\x80\x99s president and co-owner. She would soon clean house while promoting Johnson.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, using Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s given name. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are determined to get back to competing to win N.B.A. championships again.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The first major test of the new regime had decidedly mixed results.'
b'Days before the draft, Johnson shed the costly contract of Timofey Mozgov by giving up on D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo Russell, whom the team had selected second over all just two years earlier. In return for the duo, the Brooklyn Nets gave up Brook Lopez and the 27th pick in the draft, which turned into the promising Kyle Kuzma. But Russell has blossomed this year with the Nets, earning an All-Star appearance while leading Brooklyn back to the playoffs.'
b'Russell\xe2\x80\x99s departure opened the point guard spot for Lonzo Ball, who has flashed two-way potential but largely fallen short of his lofty expectations as the second pick in the draft. In addition to Kuzma, the Lakers struck gold with Josh Hart, who was selected 30th and has become a core piece.'
b'Johnson made no secret of his intent to draw the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest stars to Los Angeles, with an eye toward what was expected to be a major 2018 off-season. The team largely punted on the 2017 off-season to preserve its salary cap space in 2018, signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a one-year deal.'
b'At the 2018 trade deadline, the Lakers shed the contracts of Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., opening more cap space. Johnson said the trade indicated the Lakers would have the cap space and the ability to land two star players, either by trade or free agency.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made the move if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t confident,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the time.'
b'Signing LeBron James to a long-term contract in 2018 was exactly the kind of result the Lakers had planned for and needed, setting expectations that they would return to the playoffs and compete for a championship. But the free agents the Lakers signed to surround him \xe2\x80\x94 Caldwell-Pope, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley \xe2\x80\x94 immediately puzzled some observers.'
b'An optimist would have called them playoff-tested veterans. Others saw it differently: A cast of nonshooters and big personalities who would have a questionable fit next to James and the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 young talent.'
b'The hodgepodge crew was assembled partly because the team struck out on its bigger targets. After years of speculation that Paul George would return to his hometown, he instead opted to re-sign with Oklahoma City. The San Antonio Spurs sent Kawhi Leonard east to the Toronto Raptors. DeMarcus Cousins signed a bargain, one-year deal with the Golden State Warriors.'
b'Once the season arrived, the Lakers blew it in dramatic fashion, extending their record playoff drought. But they preserved cap space for the 2019 off-season, giving them another chance to add a star.'
b'There could be little doubt the Lakers would be interested in Anthony Davis as soon as he became available. James and Davis share an agent, and the Lakers were long believed to be Davis\xe2\x80\x99s most committed suitor.'
b'But when the All-Star center made a public trade request in late January, he created a debacle for Johnson and the Lakers. The players in the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 young core \xe2\x80\x94 Ball, Kuzma, Hart and Brandon Ingram, the second overall pick from the 2016 draft \xe2\x80\x94 were constantly named in leaked trade offers.'
b'The Pelicans made an effort to head off any potential tampering when they announced Davis\xe2\x80\x99s trade request. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction,\xe2\x80\x9d the team said in a statement.'
b'In addition to Davis\xe2\x80\x99s connections to the Lakers, Los Angeles had a well-known history of tampering, dating back to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s tweets before he took over.'
b'Johnson was not very subtle about recruiting George during a 2017 appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Kimmel Live,\xe2\x80\x9d during which he was asked what he would do if he saw the player socially.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to say hi because we know each other, you just can\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, I want you to come to the Lakers,\xe2\x80\x99 even though I\xe2\x80\x99ll be wink-winking like, \xe2\x80\x98You know what that means, right?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The episode earned Johnson a warning from the N.B.A., and the team was later fined $500,000 for what the league deemed impermissible contact between Pelinka and George\xe2\x80\x99s agent.'
b'In June 2018, Johnson was fined $50,000 for his comments about Giannis Antetokounmpo after praising the Bucks star.'
b'In February, the Sixers\xe2\x80\x99 Ben Simmons \xe2\x80\x94 who plays as an oversize point guard, like Johnson did \xe2\x80\x94 requested a meeting with Johnson to get playing tips, prompting Johnson to publicly praise the former Rookie of the Year. But the league ultimately determined Johnson had not broken tampering rules.'

b'Kyrie Irving scored 37 points and the Boston Celtics rallied late in the fourth quarter to beat the Indiana Pacers by 99-91 on Wednesday night. The win gave Boston a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven, first-round series'
b'Coming out of a timeout and with a chance to tie, the Pacers\xe2\x80\x99 Wesley Matthews threw an inbounds pass into the bench on the other side of the court with 12.1 seconds left. On the ensuing play, the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 Al Horford passed to Jayson Tatum, who was fouled on a two-handed dunk. He completed the three-point play to make it 97-91 with 8.8 seconds left.'
b'The Pacers turned it over again and the Celtics were able to close out the game at the free throw line.'
b'Tatum scored 26 points, including a thunderous dunk down the stretch to help punctuate a 10-0 run by Boston over the final five minutes.'
b'[Read: Jayson Tatum has a daily reminder of the booming dunk he delivered on LeBron James last year.]'
b'Bojan Bogdanovic led Indiana with 23 points. Thaddeus Young added 15 points.'
b'Indiana led by 79-68 entering the fourth. Horford opened the final period scoring on a hook shot in the lane and Tyreke Evans responded with a 3-pointer on Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s first possession.'
b'But then Boston caught fire, using a 16-0 run, including eight straight by Irving, to take an 86-82 lead with 5:04 to play. Indiana missed 10 straight shots during the run, finally breaking a nearly eight-minute scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Matthews in front of the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 bench.'
b'Horford had been a game-time decision with an illness, but was able to remain in the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 starting lineup. He was noticeably a step slower at the outset and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take his first shot until late in the second quarter. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t score his first points until the fourth, finishing with four points, 10 rebounds and four assists for the game.'
b'Game 3 is Friday in Indiana.'
b'BUCKS 120, PISTONS 99 Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 13 of his 26 points in Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s big third quarter and the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons, 120-99, on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 lead in the first-round playoff series.'
b'Eric Bledsoe led the Bucks with 27 points, and Khris Middleton had 24. Milwaukee is trying win a playoff series for the first time since 2001.'
b'Luke Kennard had 19 points for Detroit. Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond each added 18, and Drummond had 16 rebounds. Detroit star Blake Griffin sat out again with a left knee injury, but received a technical for the second straight game for arguing from the bench.'
b'After scoring 10 points and playing only 14 minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, Antetokounmpo scored Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s first seven points in the third quarter. The Bucks outscored Detroit 35-17 in the period to take a 93-76 lead into the fourth.'
b'Detroit clawed within seven in the fourth before the Bucks put it away, capped by a hard drive by Antetokounmpo on a break. He banked in an awkward reverse-angle shot while crashing to the floor after being fouled by Drummond. He competed the three-point play it make it 105-87.'
b'Game 3 is Saturday night in Detroit.'
b'GRIZZLIES HIRE EXECUTIVES The Memphis Grizzlies have hired Rich Cho as vice president of basketball strategy and Glen Grunwald as a senior adviser within the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s basketball operations department.'
b'Cho is a former Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers general manager. Grunwald was general manager of the Knicks and the Toronto Raptors.'
b'Before coming to Portland, Cho was an assistant general manager with the Seattle SuperSonics and continued in that role when the franchise became the Oklahoma City Thunder. Grunwald worked with the Knicks from 2006-13, serving as executive vice president and general manager for the final two seasons of that stretch. He was Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s general manager from 1997 to 2004.'

b'LeBron James, sidelined since Dec. 25 with a groin strain, will remain out until at least next week, the Los Angeles Lakers announced Wednesday. The team said in a statement that James did not travel with the Lakers on their current road trip for games against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday and the Houston Rockets on Saturday.'
b'The Lakers have struggled without James \xe2\x80\x94 and without Rajon Rondo, their backup point guard, who was also injured in the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 road win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. Entering Thursday, the Lakers had gone 4-7 without those two players and were tied with the Sacramento Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference standings.'
b'[On Pro Basketball: The Warriors Prepare to Add Another Star: DeMarcus Cousins]'
b'After their current trip, the Lakers will return home to play the Warriors on Monday \xe2\x80\x94 which, incidentally, is slated to be Game 2 of the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 well-publicized DeMarcus Cousins experiment as he returns from surgery on his Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon \xe2\x80\x94 but it is highly unlikely that James will be available. The Lakers said in their statement that James \xe2\x80\x9chas been cleared to return to practice commencing next week, and progress toward a return to game play thereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'James, 34, had been fairly indestructible thus far in his career. He appeared in all 82 regular-season games for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season. But while the Lakers initially listed James as \xe2\x80\x9cday to day\xe2\x80\x9d after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam last month, the team has been handling him \xe2\x80\x94 and his eventual return \xe2\x80\x94 with caution.'
b'James was playing some of the best basketball of his career before he got hurt, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game. A four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, he is in the first year of a four-year contract worth $154 million.'

b'MacLeod joined the Suns in 1973 after they had ended a 38-44 season. At the time the Suns, who joined the league in the 1968-69 season, had never won an N.B.A. playoff series.'
b'His first two seasons in Phoenix were rocky, but in time he became the most successful coach in Suns history, going 579-543 in the regular seasons over 14 years.'
b'MacLeod\xe2\x80\x99s first winning season with the Suns ended with a 42-40 record, just enough to edge them into the 1976 playoffs. Phoenix then went on a dramatic run that culminated in their defeating the top-ranked Golden State Warriors for the Western Conference championship in seven games.'
b'The finals against the Celtics featured a tense fifth game, with the teams tied at two games apiece, that went into triple overtime at Boston Garden and into the basketball history books.'
b'Coming back from far behind, Phoenix tied the game at the end of regulation play and again at the end of the first overtime. Many fans swarmed the court after the Celtics star John Havlicek sunk a shot at the end of the second overtime to put Boston ahead, 111-110. But the referees ruled that a second remained on the clock and cleared the court.'
b'The game, with an unruly capacity crowd in the stands, went into a third overtime because of a canny decision. With that one second remaining, the Suns Hall of Fame guard Paul Westphal called a timeout, even though Phoenix had none left. That cost the Suns a technical foul and gave Boston another point on a successful free throw, but it also gave the Suns the ball at center court for a final play. The Suns forward Gar Heard took the inbounds pass, shot and tied the score, 112-112.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCredit that move to Paul Westphal,\xe2\x80\x9d MacLeod told The New York Times. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thought of it while we were trying to map out a play. But with all those fans surrounding him, taunting our players and causing more fights, how could a coach coach? It was the most dangerous situation I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the end, the Celtics triumphed, 128-126, and won the series, four games to two. The Suns, nicknamed the Sunderella Suns for their unlikely run, went on to appear in eight more playoffs and two more Western Conference finals under MacLeod.'
b'He had a franchise-record 37 playoff victories with the Suns and was placed in the Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor in 2012.'
b'The Suns dismissed him in 1987, after the team started the season 22-34. He also coached the Dallas Mavericks from 1987 to 1989, taking them to the playoffs in one season, and the Knicks, in 1990-91, achieving a 32-35 record. He finished his 18-year head coaching career with a 707-657 mark.'
b'John Matthew MacLeod was born on Oct. 3, 1937, in New Albany, Ind. He played basketball at Providence High School in Clarksville, Ind., and at Bellarmine University in Louisville, Ky.'
b'He was a successful head coach at the University of Oklahoma before he joined the Suns. He was later the head coach at the University of Notre Dame from 1991 until 1999. MacLeod\xe2\x80\x99s son Matt played on the team for his last two seasons as coach.'
b'After leaving Notre Dame, MacLeod returned to the Suns as an assistant coach. He was also an assistant with the Denver Nuggets and the Warriors, ending his career in 2006.'
b'In addition to his son, his survivors include his wife, Carol, and a daughter, Kathleen.'

b'Paul George has a small freshwater pond behind his house in Oklahoma City that he stocks with bass, crappie and bluegill. Whenever he has a couple of hours to spare from his responsibilities as a do-everything forward for the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Thunder, he heads out back with his fishing rod. He releases what he catches \xe2\x80\x94 for now, anyway.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting for them to get a little bigger,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'George has time. Last summer, on the first night of free agency, he agreed to re-sign with the Thunder on a four-year, $137 million deal. The news emanated from a house party that Russell Westbrook, his superstar teammate, was hosting for George, who did not even entertain meetings with rival teams. He was sticking with the Thunder.'
b'In doing so, George made clear that he was banking on his partnership with Westbrook while offering endorsements of the organization and of Oklahoma City\xe2\x80\x99s leisurely pace. He can fish. He can raise his two young children in a quiet neighborhood. And he can focus on basketball, knowing that his future is with the Thunder.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can give your everything to one organization, and you know the direction that you\xe2\x80\x99re going,\xe2\x80\x9d George said in a recent interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so much that players have to deal with that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people quite recognize. A lot of them are the same issues that everybody else deals with. But this takes a lot of the burden off my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There is something to be said for (relatively) stress-free living. As several other stars careen toward free agency this summer \xe2\x80\x94 and grapple with the accompanying distractions with varying degrees of success \xe2\x80\x94 George, 28, has been playing the best basketball of his life.'
b'He is averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists, all career highs, while shooting 44 percent from the field and 39.1 percent from 3-point range. He is at least in the conversation for his first N.B.A. Most Valuable Player Award.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think the shift I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Billy Donovan said, \xe2\x80\x9cis a guy who\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'George has been limited recently by shoulder soreness, and Oklahoma City has slipped a bit in the standings. But the Thunder are capable of being a force in the playoffs, and they appear to be a close-knit group. One reason: Oklahoma City is not exactly flush with \xe2\x80\x9cextracurriculars,\xe2\x80\x9d as George put it, so the players tend to linger at the practice facility. They spend a lot of time together, which has helped build chemistry.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if one person has to go do something, there\xe2\x80\x99s always someone else who\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tag along with you,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s kind of been the culture here.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'George was traded to the Thunder before the start of last season, after he told the Indiana Pacers that he would not sign a contract extension. Most figured that Oklahoma City would be a pit stop for George, who grew up in Palmdale, Calif., about 50 miles north of Los Angeles. More to the point: He had told the Pacers that he wanted to be shipped to the Lakers.'
b'Indiana balked and instead dealt him to Oklahoma City, where George averaged 21.9 points and 5.7 rebounds last season. After Oklahoma City lost in the first round of the playoffs, George was a free agent. He could have gone nearly anywhere, including to the Lakers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had so many phone calls and people asking me what he would do when it was all still up in the air,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Hegre, his former coach at Knight High School, said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I personally felt that he would stay with the Thunder. I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he would bail on something before he gave it a legitimate chance.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hegre also said he suspected that Oklahoma City itself had something to do with George\xe2\x80\x99s decision. Even now, after six All-Star appearances, George is a small-town guy and a self-described \xe2\x80\x9chomebody.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Back in his high school days, George and his father would occasionally ask Hegre if the team was planning to practice over the weekend. Hegre knew that meant they were thinking about going fishing. They had their favorite spots: Hughes Lake, Lake Elsinore, Lopez Lake, Little Rock Reservoir.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI always thought that was pretty cool,\xe2\x80\x9d Hegre said.'
b'George has never played in a major market. Not in high school (Palmdale). Not in college (Fresno State). And not in the N.B.A., which may not be a coincidence. When he was with the Pacers, George lived in a suburban community with a large lake, where he kept a boat. He fished there, too.'
b'At the same time, his exit from Indiana affected him. It was the first time he felt disliked by the masses, and he was someone who had always tried hard to avoid disappointing or hurting people, said Steve Cleveland, his former coach at Fresno State.'
b'When George told Cleveland that he was entering the N.B.A. draft after two seasons at Fresno State, he was apologetic \xe2\x80\x94 and so were his parents, who kept apologizing even after George began to star for the Pacers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had to say, \xe2\x80\x98Stop it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cleveland said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of people they are.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never really asked him this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure leaving Indiana was a pretty sensitive deal for him. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he wanted to go through all that stress again.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is not hard to find big-time players who have come unglued at times because of their impending free agencies. Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors boycotted the news media for a couple of weeks. Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics has complained about the steep price of celebrity. For his part, George blamed \xe2\x80\x9cthe press\xe2\x80\x9d for being a disruptive force in locker rooms.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverything gets blown up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is a big deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is no small feat, then, that George has found a home with the Thunder \xe2\x80\x94 and calm waters in Oklahoma City.'

b'Lou Williams, who has the unusual role of leading the Clippers in scoring while coming off the bench, does not run around the court so much as flutter across it. At 6 feet 1 inch and 175 pounds, he has embraced his identity as a butterfly among a herd of cattle.'
b'But at this stage of his career, Williams wants to feel as light and nimble as possible \xe2\x80\x94 so he essentially starves himself on game days. After a big breakfast, he refuses to eat again until well after the game itself, often going nearly 12 hours between meals.'
b'It is one of several habits that Williams, 32, has developed over the years, and one that clearly works for him. It is also the opposite of how most elite athletes prepare for games. But Williams is different: He wants to take the court with an appetite.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d Landry Shamet, the first-year Clippers guard, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d weigh about 115 pounds if I did that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Clippers, as they often have this season, turned to Williams on Monday night for an extraordinary performance \xe2\x80\x94 this time against the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series. In the Clippers\xe2\x80\x99 135-131 win, Williams collected 36 points and 11 assists to help erase a 31-point deficit.'
b'Shamet sealed the biggest comeback in N.B.A. playoff history with a go-ahead 3-pointer with 16.5 seconds left, and the Clippers evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m one of those guys who can get hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Williams, who shot 13 of 22 from the field, \xe2\x80\x9cand I just got lost in the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Clippers, who have thrived behind Williams in the wake of a midseason deal that sent Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers, will need all of him again \xe2\x80\x94 all his scoring, all his savvy, all his unusual rituals \xe2\x80\x94 when the Warriors come to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday.'
b'Make no mistake, the Clippers have their share of scrappy, no-nonsense guys. Patrick Beverley, who has spent the series covering the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 Kevin Durant like aluminum foil, would trash talk a telephone pole.'
b'Williams, on the other hand, carries himself with a brand of quiet composure that has a power all its own.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe goes about his business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam Cassell, an assistant coach for the Clippers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not overwhelmingly faster than people. He\xe2\x80\x99s not bigger than people. But he understands what he can do on the basketball court, and he does it well.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 Klay Thompson recently came across a package of highlight clips from Williams\xe2\x80\x99s days as a star guard at South Gwinnett High School outside of Atlanta. What stood out to Thompson was how little Williams had changed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe played the exact same way,\xe2\x80\x9d Thompson said in an interview before the start of the series. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was incredible: same step-back jumper, same hesitations, same floaters.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams has stuck with the same general blueprint while refining his skills \xe2\x80\x94 slicker, craftier, jazzier. He has also become more resilient. There was a time, he said, when he thought his career might be finished. In 2013, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while playing for the Atlanta Hawks. In his comeback, he turned to Kenny Atkinson, who was then one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s assistants, to help reassemble his game.'
b'Atkinson, now the head coach of the Nets, imbued Williams with the importance of routine.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKenny is one of my all-time favorite people in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI give him a lot of credit for getting me back on my feet when I was down and out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'By 2015, Williams was the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s sixth man of the year with the Toronto Raptors. But he has never been better, more efficient or more dynamic than he has been in his last two seasons with the Clippers, all at an age \xe2\x80\x94 early 30s \xe2\x80\x94 when most players see their production begin to erode.'
b'Instead, Williams, who has scored more points off the bench than any other player in league history, has only improved. This season, he averaged 20 points and 5.4 assists in just 26.6 minutes a game. Williams also had the ball in his hands more than ever, with the Clippers running 32.4 percent of their plays through him whenever he was on the court, according to usage-rate statistics compiled by Basketball Reference.'
b'Coming off the bench was never something that he necessarily wanted to do, but Williams has no doubt that the role has helped preserve his career because it has kept his minutes down. He has averaged 24.6 minutes a game over his 14-year career. (LeBron James, by comparison, has averaged 38.6 minutes.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s given me an opportunity to stretch my career out, and I think I\xe2\x80\x99m in my prime right now, man,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just rolling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At the same time, Williams has his quirky customs, which help give him a sense of stability, starting with his game-day breakfast: hash browns, egg whites, French toast and chicken sausage along with a fruit smoothie that he sweetens with honey. He loads up because he knows he won\xe2\x80\x99t eat again for a while.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI guess my body\xe2\x80\x99s gotten used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said, who will just do the smoothie if the Clippers have an early tipoff.'
b'He also has the peculiar habit of arriving at the arena on the late side, about 90 minutes before the start of the game.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like idle time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Once there, though, Williams has an active schedule: 15 minutes in the training room getting stretched out, 10 minutes in the weight room doing exercises with a stretch band and a medicine ball, then about 17 minutes on the court making 150 field goals as Cassell feeds him passes.'
b'Before a recent home game ahead of the playoffs, Williams made nearly 80 percent of his attempts, including two skyscraping moonshots from the baseline, which is a shot that he has developed in case a 7-footer lunges at him with his arms extended. Williams says he only practices shots that he will attempt in games, however improbable or acrobatic.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI catch myself at least two or three times a game just putting my hands up, like, \xe2\x80\x98How did that even happen?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Shamet said.'
b'Williams wraps up his on-court work with 20 free throws and 10 court-width sprints, then retreats to the locker room to put on his ankle braces and check his phone. \xe2\x80\x9cJust to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no family emergencies or anything like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'With 20 minutes on the clock, the Clippers have their team meeting. Before they head to the court, Williams gathers his teammates around him for one final huddle \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, they gather around him, as if he has some sort of gravitational pull.'
b'Once the game begins, Williams takes a seat on the bench \xe2\x80\x94 which is the only time he stops moving. But he is watching his potential defenders and studying the flow, readying himself for the moment when he sheds his warm-ups late in the first quarter.'
b'If Cassell can pinpoint one flaw, it might be that Williams commits too many turnovers. He is an excellent passer, especially coming off ball screens \xe2\x80\x94 Shamet considers him one of the most underrated passers in the league \xe2\x80\x94 but he sometimes tries to do too much, Cassell said. So Cassell will remind Williams to do what he does best: Shoot the ball. '
b'It is what everyone wants to see from Williams, who is regarded around the league as a player whom other players love to watch.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means a lot coming from my peers,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think as competitors, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we get into this, to gain respect from the guys who have played the game, and you walk away and they say, \xe2\x80\x98He was a tough cover \xe2\x80\x94 that dude was nice.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'All while being fueled with a hunger of his own creation.'

b'The Knicks won a basketball game Thursday night. That has not happened since Jan. 4.'
b'There won\xe2\x80\x99t be a ticker-tape parade, but it was a surprise. This, after all, has been a really bad season for the Knicks.'
b'They are 11-47. The win, over the Atlanta Hawks, 106-91, broke an 18-game losing streak, which was a franchise record.'
b'The team traded away its most popular player by far, Kristaps Porzingis, and in return got a rookie and a couple of expiring contracts. The deal also meant the cancellation of the coming Latvian Heritage Night at Madison Square Garden, which frankly was shaping up to be one of the highlights of the season.'
b'To be fair, a core of loyalists insist that these Knicks are a fun bunch to watch. And there is optimistic talk for next year.'
b'The Knicks are bad enough to have a decent shot at the top draft pick, probably Zion Williamson, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s superstar big man. Cap space will allow the team to seek big-name free agents, and there is sunny speculation that the team could land stars like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving or even both.'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll see about that. But for now, fans are left pondering if the Knicks are historically dreadful or just run-of-the-mill dreadful.'
b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how the Knicks rate, at least in the current century.'
b'That means this year\xe2\x80\x99s Knicks won\xe2\x80\x99t have to compete against the consensus worst team of them all, the legendary 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers of 1972-73.'
b'Despite a couple of 50-win seasons, in 2000 and 2013, the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 winning percentage this century is .416, worst in the N.B.A. Yes, even worse than the Washington Wizards, and Charlotte Hornets, and even the Nets.'
b'Here is how the 2018-19 Knicks stack up.'
b'This is where it begins and ends. Wins. Losses. But mostly losses. Lots and lots of losses.'
b'The Knicks are 11-47, giving them a winning percentage that looks like a typo: .190.'
b'But there were worse seasons in the last 20 years. In 2012, the Bobcats (now the Hornets) finished at 7-59 in a lockout season for a .106 percentage.'
b'Over a full season, the 76ers in 2016, in full tanking mode, only barely managed to break double digit wins with a 10-72 record.'
b'The Knicks are only 11th worst.'
b'Even counting just those streaks that are contained in a single season, the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 18-gamer comes up short. The 2011 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2014 76ers both managed to stumble to 26 straight losses. After Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s win, the Knicks have lost their chance at that ignominious record.'
b'The Knicks have been outscored by 8.7 points in an average game this season.'
b'Again, there have been worse teams. The 2012 Charlotte strike team lost by 13.9 points a game. The 2000 Clippers put up minus-11.5 over a full season.'
b'The Knicks are only 25th.'
b'There are those Sixers again: In 2015, they shot .408 for the season. At .430, the Knicks are 39th.'
b'The 2009 Grizzlies had only 17.4 assists per game, trailed closely by the 2006 Knicks of Larry Brown, Stephon Marbury and notorious nonpasser Eddy Curry.'
b'This season\xe2\x80\x99s Knicks aren\xe2\x80\x99t good, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t really bad, at 19.9, for 91st place.'
b'It is not a good time for defensive stats in the N.B.A. Using the metric points allowed per 100 possessions, three teams this season are in the top five of the century: The Cavaliers are allowing 117 points per 100, worst of the era, and indeed for as far back as Basketball-Reference\xe2\x80\x99s stats go. Over the last 20 years, this season\xe2\x80\x98s Suns are second, and the Knicks, at 113.4, are seventh.'
b'Do any of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Knicks individually reach truly humiliating marks? Not really.'
b'Frank Ntilikina\xe2\x80\x99s .342 shooting percentage is poor certainly, but it is only 24th worst among players with 15 minutes a game and 40 games played, a lot better than DeShawn Stevenson\xe2\x80\x99s .285 from the 2012 Nets.'
b'So we are forced to conclude, that while dispiritingly bad, the Knicks come up short in another way too. They are not even really close to being the worst team of the last 20 years.'

b'HOLBROOK, Ariz. \xe2\x80\x94 A wind that would not stop tugged at flags and sent sand devils spinning into this desert town as I walked past Mr. Maestas Restaurant and the Arizona Pawnman and the Empty Pockets Saloon and came to a rise and looked across an emptiness of plain that stretched the limits of vision.'
b'I recalled my talk a few days ago with Mike Budenholzer at the Ritz-Carlton in New York City. He coaches the Milwaukee Bucks, who finished the regular season with 60 wins and the best record in the N.B.A. His team features a brilliant Greek forward-guard-center named Giannis Antetokounmpo, Montenegrin and Turkish forwards, a Spanish center, and black and white players from corners rural and urban.'
b'He is known for his deft handling of diverse pro players. Where, I asked, did you pick up that skill?'
b'Let me tell you about my hometown, Holbrook, he said.'
b'Budenholzer, blue-eyed and middle-age, was once was a skinny, blond, teenage shooting guard in this old cattle and railway town. He starred on the Roadrunners basketball team at Holbrook High School alongside his boyhood friend B. J. Little, an African-American; a few Anglos; and a half-dozen Navajo boys who could run and pass all day and all night.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in mind that my background there has helped me navigate life in the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x9d Budenholzer said. \xe2\x80\x9cGrowing up, you knew Navajo culture and black culture from Louisiana and Mexicans. I learned to foster the same sort of culture.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Holbrook comprises its own world, an isolated high desert city of 5,053 that sits on the southern lip of the Navajo Nation, which is the size of the Republic of Ireland. To the south lies the small Mormon town of Snowflake, and beyond that the forests and canyons of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, which is bigger than Delaware.'
b'Holbrook\xe2\x80\x99s population is roughly 50 percent white and 50 percent Navajo, Hopi, Mexican and black. The city has long kept a dormitory for Navajo children whose parents want them to attend the well-regarded Holbrook High School. Founded in the 1880s, Holbrook was an outlaw-friendly habitat, and a sign on the South Side tends to underline this point: Bucket of Blood Street. Terrill\xe2\x80\x99s Cottage Saloon once stood on this street, and more than a few cowpokes breathed their last there.'
b'Quite a few youngsters leave in search of better prospects. The city is tattered at the edges, a few buildings lie gape-toothed and abandoned, a motel stands vacant, and a single movie theater shows a single movie. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hospitable place, and the main drag, Navajo Boulevard, has Mexican restaurants and motels and Native American jewelry stores and a herd of giant plastic dinosaurs that signal proximity to Petrified Forest National Park.'
b'Budenholzer\xe2\x80\x99s father, Vince, coached the basketball team and won a state championship in 1971 and was inducted into the state coaching hall of fame. At the time, Mike was an assistant to Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs. During a team visit to Phoenix, he told Popovich of his father\xe2\x80\x99s ascent. When Vince showed up later that day, Popovich got down on a knee in the hotel and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a real coach.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Father and son were two hoops tramps who traveled in school buses hundreds of miles across the empty quarter of Northern Arizona in search of games and wins.'
b'Vince\xe2\x80\x99s Holbrook teams played a variation on the Native American hoops style known as Rez Ball: A quicksilver, sneaker-squeaking, run-pass-pass-shoot style, perfect for the Navajo and the Apache, for whom distance running is a millenniums-old tradition.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe pressed from the minute we stepped off the bus,\xe2\x80\x9d Vince said. \xe2\x80\x9dI had one Navajo who was taller than 6 foot, and so what?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Vince is 89 and still lean in that way of an old athlete, and he and his wife, Libby, moved nine years ago to Queen Valley, in the cactus foothills of the Superstition Mountains, east of Phoenix. They miss Holbrook; it remains the home of their hearts, but the winters on that mile-high plateau ran them off. \xe2\x80\x9cThe winds never stop blowing,\xe2\x80\x9d Libby said.'
b'The couple raised seven children, five boys and two girls, in a small house across Florida Street from Hunt Park. Libby became a councilwoman and served a term as mayor, and Vince moonlighted as Holbrook\xe2\x80\x99s parks and recreation director during the summer. He built a hoop in his backyard and put up a floodlight so the teenagers could play into the evening.'
b'Little, Mike\xe2\x80\x99s old teammate who is now a judge in nearby Winslow, drove me by that house, which was sold years back. The hoop still stood.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh man, we\xe2\x80\x99d play there the whole night, and Vince would never stop coaching,\xe2\x80\x9d Little said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy grandparents said I had to get home before the streetlights came on. But if I was playing ball with Mikey at the Budenholzers, that was my pass.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Father and son Budenholzer flashed hauntingly similar smiles when they recalled those days. Mike was the leading scorer on the Roadrunners, a kid who could shoot from near and far and almost as well with his left hand as his right. Little, whose grandparents came from Louisiana to work in the McNary Saw Mill, ripped rebounds, and the Navajo kids dribbled and ran and pressed.'
b'The day before the tournament, two of the best players got drunk. They were suspended, and that left the Roadrunners with one star: Mike Budenholzer. That was not enough horsepower, and the team lost. \xe2\x80\x9cIt boggled my mind that they would get caught,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would give up an N.B.A. championship to get that one back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'I looked at him: You\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, right? He shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, winning a state championship in Arizona, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Navajo and Mexican and Anglo kids still play baseball, basketball and football and live more or less shoulder to shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a town where you played everything and with everyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only social rule you recognized in high school was that Mormon girls don\xe2\x80\x99t date non-Mormons.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you adjust.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Budenholzer was a good student and got into Pomona College, a fine liberal arts institution in California. He was not yet sold. He was a jock and he wanted to play basketball and he already had a scholarship offer in hand.'
b'He visited Pomona and sat around with other students and listened as they talked of their choices. There was the kid who was weighing Williams College or Pomona, and another who was wait-listed at Stanford University. They looked at Budenholzer and asked, What about you?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tell them I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to choose between Pomona and Yavapai Community College, where I could get a free ride,\xe2\x80\x9d Budenholzer said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they were, like, \xe2\x80\x98whaaaat?\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, \xe2\x80\x98What am I doing here, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the wrong place.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'
b'His brothers and sisters decided Mikey, the youngest, was going to Pomona. They pooled money as best they could so he could afford it. He graduated with a degree in philosophy and economics.'
b'Before he left Holbrook and set out on his life journey, Budenholzer did what he did every summer, which is to say he rounded up B. J. Little and other buddies and piled into a car and headed north to play in the informal spring tournaments that are a staple of life on the Navajo reservation. They drove across washes and around canyons and past red-ribbed buttes that reared like primeval monsters. They pulled into Navajo towns: Dilkon and Window Rock, Tuba City and Ganado, anywhere there was a tournament.'
b'They got caught up in endless Rez Ball games, running and shooting and banging one another from morning till late at night. As hoops is civic religion on the rez, crowds of hundreds watched and cheered, not least for the bilagaanas (Navajo for whites).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose spring tournaments got rough, the referees were terrible and man, it was just the best,\xe2\x80\x9d Budenholzer said.'
b'During the season when reservation teams arrived to play Holbrook, a long line of cars would follow. The rule was straightforward for Holbrook\xe2\x80\x99s fans, Vince said. Make it to the gym by 4 p.m. for a 7 p.m. game, or you could forget about finding a seat.'
b'It is not so different when Mike\xe2\x80\x99s teams pull into Phoenix. After working as an assistant with the Spurs, he coached the Atlanta Hawks before coming to Milwaukee. Whenever his team plays the Phoenix Suns, Little\xe2\x80\x99s sister sets to work organizing a Holbrook caravan. Dozens of cars wend their way down through ponderosa forests and jagged mountains to the game \xe2\x80\x94 whites, Mexicans, blacks and Navajos, sometimes 100 strong. After the game, Budenholzer talks with them.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt always moves me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike says.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since he left home. This summer, after the N.B.A. playoffs and before the pro summer leagues begin, he and Vince and Libby plan to drive up through the Tonto National Forest and across the Salt River Canyon to Holbrook. And when they reach their old high school gym, they will find teammates and students and teachers and townspeople gathered to listen as Superintendent Robert Koerperich dedicates the Vince Budenholzer gym floor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo let our kids know that you can come out of Holbrook and coach a pro team, how amazing is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Koeperich says.'
b'Mike Budenholzer looks forward to walking Navajo Boulevard and maybe seeing the family house again. Then he wants to stand behind Vince and Libby and clap so hard.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo have raised seven kids on a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s salary in a great small town and let us interact and form great friendships with Navajos and Mexicans and blacks and Mormons. They were really ahead of their time,\xe2\x80\x9d Budenholzer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is America.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'CHARLOTTE, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Stephen Curry was about 25 minutes into a news conference here on Saturday afternoon when a magician who goes by the name Jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick. Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, seemed impressed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was nice, big fella,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was crazy. Y\xe2\x80\x99all see that? Did y\xe2\x80\x99all see that? What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, boss? Jibrizy? Nice to meet you, man. Fire. You\xe2\x80\x99re fire. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s up.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Lots of weird stuff tends to happen during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, and a cameo by Jibrizy was no exception. But it was also the rare instance when the spotlight left Curry, if only for a moment, in the run-up to the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s flagship game on Sunday.'
b'Curry, a six-time All-Star and two-time most valuable player who has already coaxed Golden State to three championships, is used to lots of attention. But he relished his return to Charlotte, where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time \xe2\x80\x94 and where he is still revered.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the time I started playing basketball at 5, right down the street at the recreation center, to now, a lot has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of great things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Curry was not so great Sunday, but that was not the point. He finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists for Team Giannis in a 178-164 loss to Team LeBron in the All-Star Game, which was a defense-free postscript to a weekend that was a Curry family affair.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIncredibly fond of the family,\xe2\x80\x9d Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to be the first family of Charlotte, at least this week.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'For much of his trip home, Curry was accompanied by his father, Dell, who spent 10 seasons playing for the Charlotte Hornets, and his mother, Sonya, who drilled a half-court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center. It was probably the family\xe2\x80\x99s splashiest shot of the weekend.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen Curry said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the first four she flung underhand, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to the rim. And then that last one, it just looked good from the moment it left her hand, and I was going, \xe2\x80\x98Wham, bam, can of ham! That\xe2\x80\x99s going in!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Curry had less success in Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s 3-point shootout, where he was joined by his younger brother, Seth, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry made it to the championship round before losing to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets.'
b'But Curry had also found time to return to Davidson College, his alma mater, where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an 80-72 victory over St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s on Friday night.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe energy in the building was unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s surreal every time I get to go back there.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The following afternoon, Curry swayed in a sea of reporters (and at least one magician) as he fielded a wide-ranging mix of questions.'
b'What did it mean to him to be back in Charlotte? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of overwhelming to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be like the Energizer bunny.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Could he say something nice to all his fans in the Dominican Republic? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, and I hope to go back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Did he have a favorite basketball-themed movie? \xe2\x80\x9cProbably \xe2\x80\x98Love & Basketball,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a romantic, bro.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'During warm-ups for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Curry mimicked a game of volleyball with Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, posted up a ball boy so that he could take an entry pass from Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, made chitchat with bigwigs who were courtside and jacked his share of 30-footers. Most of them went in. All-Star weekend is a circus, but it is still basketball, after all, and Curry has unique skills.'
b'He is assembling another spectacular season, even if his work has been overshadowed by fellow All-Stars like James Harden of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Thunder and Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been so consistently good for so long now \xe2\x80\x94 and his team so dominant \xe2\x80\x94 that perhaps some of the novelty has worn off. It is unfair, of course.'
b'If his feats feel too familiar, consider his production this season: 28.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 48.8 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from 3-point range. He missed 11 games with a groin injury but spent part of that time gluing the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 locker room back together after Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had a big dust-up.'
b'The friction stemmed from Durant\xe2\x80\x99s looming free agency, which has been a steady hum of distraction for the Warriors. But Curry has been a stabilizing force for his team \xe2\x80\x94 and even for the league.'
b'With a contract that runs through the 2021-22 season, Curry has not had to face pressing questions about his future. He is committed to the Warriors, and the Warriors appear committed to him. He is a throwback in an era dominated by player movement, the current face of which is Anthony Davis, the All-Star center who recently requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans. So many other stars face uncertain summers, too: Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard among them.'
b'But Curry has his niche in Northern California, even if his roots are in North Carolina. After Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game, he described trying to persuade his father to move to the Bay Area, where Curry has settled in with his wife, Ayesha, and their three children.'
b'Dell Curry, who is a color commentator for the Hornets, always says no.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is where home is for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stephen Curry said.'
b'And for Stephen Curry, the whereabouts of his father seem to be the only player movements on his mind. Curry said he was unconcerned with free agency this summer and the potential departures of his teammates.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the business,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the great teams, the great players, they stay in the moment and they understand what\xe2\x80\x99s in front of them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'And so, after taking a weekend to dip into his past, Curry returned to looking ahead. The journey goes on.'

b'Steven Soderbergh\xe2\x80\x99s electrifying new film \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird,\xe2\x80\x9d which debuted Friday on Netflix, tells the story of a fictional N.B.A. lockout set in the Instagram Age, in which longstanding concerns about money, race and social justice are galvanized by disputes over players\xe2\x80\x99 personal images, and who has the right to control them. (Appropriately, the entire film was shot on an iPhone.)'
b'The film\xe2\x80\x99s dense but fast-moving script, written by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (\xe2\x80\x9cMoonlight\xe2\x80\x9d), is also replete with references to the game\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x94 not least to the currents of protest and politics that have coursed through pro basketball since it was segregated. There\xe2\x80\x99s a rich subtext here, much of it only hinted at. Below is a spoiler-filled guide.'
b'As in baseball, football and most areas of American life, segregation kept black players out of the white pro basketball leagues, confined to amateur and semipro all-black teams, which formed in schools, churches, community centers and the like. Games were frequently paired with ragtime dances to make for a full evening of entertainment.'
b'The best known of these barnstorming teams, often called \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Fives\xe2\x80\x9d by historians, were the New York Renaissance and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Renaissance \xe2\x80\x94 or, as they were better known, the Rens \xe2\x80\x94 were so impressive that in 1947, Coach Joe Lapchick of the New York Knicks lobbied the Basketball Association of America to admit the team into the young league, a precursor of the National Basketball Association. The owners voted him down. The next year, a competing league, the National Basketball League, brought the team in instead.'
b'[Read the Times review of \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird\xe2\x80\x9d by A.O. Scott.]'
b'Indirectly. The Rens and the Globetrotters, in particular, were internationally known for their dazzling play, often besting white teams when matched up for exhibition games. The Rens, for example, beat the all-white Oshkosh All-Stars in the first integrated tournament championship in 1939; the Globetrotters beat the Minnesota Lakers in a celebrated 1948 exhibition game that The Chicago Tribune pinpointed as key to the integration of the game.'
b'As Spencer (Bill Duke) explains in \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why the N.B.A. started integrating as the Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions started going international. Control. They wanted the control of a game that we played, and we played better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Lapchick, however, did not give up. In 1950, the year after the Basketball Association of America absorbed the smaller National Basketball League and became the N.B.A., he signed Nat (Sweetwater) Clifton, who had played for the Rens and the Globetrotters (as well as in baseball\xe2\x80\x99s Negro leagues), to join the Knicks. That same season, West Virginia State\xe2\x80\x99s Earl Lloyd joined the Washington Capitals and Chuck Cooper was drafted out of Duquesne by the Boston Celtics. (Another black player, Hank DeZonie, played five games with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in December of that season.)'
b'Talking to The Times in 2008, Lloyd told stories of being heckled and spat upon by fans, although the abuse he encountered was \xe2\x80\x9cno comparison,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, to what Jackie Robinson withstood three years earlier in professional baseball.'
b'Yes \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, there were four. (One lasted only a few hours.) In the first dialogue scene of \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird,\xe2\x80\x9d the sports agent Ray Burke (Andr\xc3\xa9 Holland) tells a client, \xe2\x80\x9cLast time this happened, folks was broke left and right!\xe2\x80\x9d That \xe2\x80\x9clast time\xe2\x80\x9d was the 2011 lockout, which lasted  five months and resulted in the loss of 16 regular-season games, the entire preseason and an estimated $400 million in revenue for team owners and players.'
b'A 10-year deal was announced late that November, which heavily favored owners. It reduced player salaries by nearly $300 million and shifted an estimated $3 billion to the owners over the course of the contract. The truncated 66-game season finally got underway on Christmas Day.'
b'Much screen time in \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird\xe2\x80\x9d is spent contemplating the legality of public appearances and exhibition games by league-signed players during the lockout. The 2011 lockout was threaded with similar concerns. The film\xe2\x80\x99s fictional team owners grouse over the attention attracted by a \xe2\x80\x9clockout street ball event in Las Vegas,\xe2\x80\x9d presumably inspired by the \xe2\x80\x9clockout league\xe2\x80\x9d in Vegas, which comprised two weeks of pickup games with more than 70 N.B.A. players in September 2011, according to The Las Vegas Sun. (Profits from ticket sales were donated to charity).'
b'Dozens of players filled the pay gap by picking up spots on teams in Europe and Japan. As The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Howard Beck noted at the time, however, \xe2\x80\x9ca vast majority of them are rookies, middling veterans and fringe players.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As New York magazine and others have noted, the character Myra (Sonja Sohn) strongly resembles Michele Roberts, who became the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association in 2014. The first woman in history to head a major sports union, Roberts made waves from the beginning. A Times profile a few months into her tenure noted that she had already \xe2\x80\x9cforcefully questioned the league\xe2\x80\x99s pay model and labeled its entire cadre of owners as replaceable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Like the character she inspired, Roberts is a tough-as-nails negotiator who is undaunted by working in a male-dominated world. \xe2\x80\x9cMy past,\xe2\x80\x9d she told players while making her case for the job, \xe2\x80\x9cis littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In the film\xe2\x80\x99s first scene, Ray gives a client a mysterious package, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains the book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Revolt of the Black Athlete\xe2\x80\x9d by the sports sociologist and civil rights advocate Dr. Harry Edwards, who also appears briefly in Ray\xe2\x80\x99s office near the end of the film. Edwards first came to national prominence for organizing the Olympic Project for Human Rights, whose members Tommie Smith and John Carlos made headlines for raising their gloved fists while receiving medals at the 1968 Olympics.'
b'Edwards has spent the ensuing years teaching, writing, consulting and leading protests. \xe2\x80\x9cRevolt,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1969, argued that racism is as prevalent in sports as in any other section of society. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sports world is not a rose flourishing in the middle of a wasteland,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is part and parcel of that wasteland, reeking of the same racism that corrupts other areas of our society.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHigh Flying Bird\xe2\x80\x9d is bookended by recordings of two folk-rock classics, both performed by Richie Havens as part of his opening set at Woodstock. The title track, Havens\xe2\x80\x99s recording of a folk song written by Billy Edd Wheeler, was praised by the musicologist Richie Unterberger for its \xe2\x80\x9carresting minor-keyed melody and brooding lyrics, contrasting the freedom of a bird to the singer\xe2\x80\x99s earthbound misery.\xe2\x80\x9d It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to connect those lyrics to Ray\xe2\x80\x99s notion that his clients should free themselves from the earthbound constraints of the sports industry and bring the game back to its roots.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome Johnny,\xe2\x80\x9d which Havens wrote with the Oscar-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr., closes the film, telling the story of a young man who marches off to a series of wars. Given the movie\xe2\x80\x99s themes, the song\xe2\x80\x99s refrain is appropriate: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long hard road, hey, before we\xe2\x80\x99ll be free.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'A move West came with dire warnings, but the reality is setting in that a James-led team might miss the playoffs.'
b'The last time LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s team missed the playoffs was 2004-5, his second year in the N.B.A.CreditCreditMark J. Rebilas/USA Today Sports, via Reuters'

b'By Marc Stein'
b'LeBron James can\xe2\x80\x99t say that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t warned. '
b'Lots of us were crowing in the summer, and pretty loudly so, about what would greet the unquestioned Lord of the Eastern Conference if he dared to defect. '
b'Sign with the Los Angeles Lakers if you wish, for the sunnier Hollywood life and all the perks, but brace yourself for the most trying regular season of your career if you decide to go West. '
b'That was the gist of the scouting report \xe2\x80\x94 which in retrospect could not have been much more prescient. '
b'On cue: The most daunting and, yes, disappointing season of James\xe2\x80\x99s career is right here, right now, for the biggest name in basketball.'
b'And it appears he will soon have to stomach that it\xe2\x80\x99s going on his ledger in the most permanent ink that he was unable to bring a halt to the longest postseason drought in Lakers history \xe2\x80\x94 barring an unforeseen resurrection from a fractured group that sits four and a half games out of a Western Conference playoff berth with 19 games to go.'
b'No matter how much culpability you wish to assign James for what is poised to go down as the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 franchise-record sixth successive trip to the draft lottery, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to own this as much as the front-office tandem of Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka as well as the under-fire coach Luke Walton.'
b'The LeBron Way, for years and years, has worked something like this: He inevitably gets most of the credit when his team flourishes; his teammates absorb the bulk of the blame when things unravel. But this is different. This would be the jarring sight of James, fresh off his eighth consecutive finals appearance, actually missing out on the N.B.A. postseason for the first time since his second professional season in 2004-5, when he was just 20.'
b'Even though he can rightly point to his recent groin strain as the biggest standings-altering disruption these Lakers have endured, James surely understands that his maiden campaign in Los Angeles is bound to be recorded in many precincts as a failure to make the playoffs that belongs to him.'
b'The Lakers are 4-7 since James returned from the groin injury that sidelined him longer (17 consecutive games) than any previous injury in his 16-year career. They have followed up an unsightly road loss to Atlanta in their final game before the All-Star break with harder-to-rationalize road losses to New Orleans, Memphis and Phoenix since the break.'
b'After Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s humiliation against a 13-51 Suns team, which dropped the Lakers to 30-33, James\xe2\x80\x99s gang only sports a 1.3-percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to Basketball-Reference.com.'
b'They also have the league\xe2\x80\x99s eighth-toughest remaining schedule, according to Tankathon.com. '
b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know if the Lakers, who had risen to a heady fourth in the West at 20-14 when James sustained the groin injury in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State, could have kept building upon that promising start with a healthy LeBron. But we most certainly do know that James\xe2\x80\x99s mere return to the lineup, at 34, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to rescue a roster that has been assailed since conception for its lack of perimeter shooting and its defensive deficiencies. Nor has he been able to galvanize a locker room that was deeply destabilized by the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 trade pursuit of the New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, which became all-consuming in late January, and has never recovered. '
b'It obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that James, after missing two key free throws in the final minute Saturday, is also converting a substandard 66.9 percent of his attempts from the line to give his critics more handy fodder.'
b'Leaving his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers for the Lakers last July without the accompaniment of a second superstar meant that James, in a far deeper conference, would have little margin for error just to reach the playoffs. When you combine James\xe2\x80\x99s injury absence with the continuing post-Davis malaise and the team\xe2\x80\x99s declining ball movement since Lonzo Ball (ankle) was sidelined six weeks ago, it adds up rather quickly to a margin that is long gone.'
b'The calls for Walton\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, as they were in January, remain nonsensical. A coaching change now, much like New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99s decision to fire General Manager Dell Demps shortly after the trade deadline, would have no discernible effect on the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 short-term prospects beyond providing their frustrated fans with a \xe2\x80\x9cSee? We did something\xe2\x80\x9d sacrifice.'
b'The prevailing assumption in league coaching circles remains that Walton will almost certainly be dismissed after the season, followed by the Lakers resuming their trade quest for Davis. But denying Walton an opportunity to at finish out a season wrought with drama and distraction since James\xe2\x80\x99s first dribble in purple and gold would be cruel and needless. '
b'Changes are coming, though. It\xe2\x80\x99s an open secret that a big off-season reset looms in Lakerland. James always knew that his new club would not be in the title mix until his second campaign as a Laker, but his patience predictably faded quickly \xe2\x80\x94 one more reason desperation has become so palpable around this team. '
b'Many of us know-it-alls in the news media indeed wrote in our preseason forecasts that the playoffs were no certainty for these Lakers, as constructed, but very few of us were actually willing to outright predict that they would miss out. Reason being: It\xe2\x80\x99s not very smart to bet against LeBron Raymone James.'
b'Yet we\xe2\x80\x99ve suddenly reached that unprecedented juncture where it would be wholly irresponsible to advise you that James can extricate himself from this jam just because he\xe2\x80\x99s LeBron. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the lingering effects from his groin injury, or his own unmistakably waning spirit in the face of increasingly bleak odds, James has been lacking the zip you associate with his well-chronicled playoff mode \xe2\x80\x94 which he assured us on Feb. 21 had been \xe2\x80\x9cactivated\xe2\x80\x9d earlier than usual.'
b'I briefly stood beside James on the floor in Charlotte, N.C., before the All-Star Game tipped off and bought into the idea a surge was coming when he insisted he was eager to embrace \xe2\x80\x9cthe challenge\xe2\x80\x9d of hauling the Lakers out of their hole.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m getting healthy, too,\xe2\x80\x9d James said that night. '
b'A mere two weeks later, it\xe2\x80\x99s already time to start imagining the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s first spring without King James after watching him for eight straight Junes \xe2\x80\x94 and wondering how on Earth he\xe2\x80\x99s going to cope with not being a part of it.'

b'The Knicks will not be going to the N.B.A. playoffs.'
b'If this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like hot-off-the-presses news, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You may have checked the standings earlier in the season and seen that the Knicks were 4-10, or 8-20, or 10-40.'
b'With Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s 115-108 loss to the Kings in Sacramento, the Knicks fell to a record of 13-51, the worst in the league. Yes, even worse than the Bulls, the Cavaliers and (shudder) the Suns. The loss also officially eliminated them from a playoff race they were unofficially eliminated from months ago.'
b'The loss, to a team that will probably also miss the playoffs, was hardly mitigated by a good scoring effort by the rookie shooting guard Allonzo Trier, who had 29 points.'
b'The Knicks are last in the league in shooting percentage and last in assists. So, in short, they can\xe2\x80\x99t pass and they can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot. Basketball Reference reports that they are particularly bad at the easiest type of shot, shooting only .603 from three feet or closer and .348 from three to 10 feet, both worst in the league.'
b'The rookie center Mitchell Robinson is fifth in the league in blocks and third in blocks per game. That\xe2\x80\x99s good. But no other Knick is in the top five in anything. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good.'
b'When you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of wins, you wind up with some losing streaks. It\xe2\x80\x99s just math. The Knicks came into the new year with an eight-game, a six-game and a couple of five-game skids, as one might expect. More unexpected: In January and February, the Knicks lost 18 in a row.'
b'On the plus side, the Knicks have put together two winning streaks. One was two games and the other was three.'
b'The Knicks have now missed the playoffs for six straight years, just short of the franchise record. From 1960 to 1966, the Knicks missed the playoffs seven straight times. But those Knicks teams always won at least 21 games in that span. This season, the Knicks are on a pace to win 16 or 17 games, giving them a chance to break the franchise-worst record of 17 in the abysmal 2014-15 season.'
b'Knicks fans, desperate for a light at the end of the 82-game tunnel, are already focusing on the coming draft lottery, right Spike Lee? Zion Williamson, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s dominant center, is the big prize. Adding Williamson and a couple of free agents lured by the bright lights of New York may finally bring the postseason back to Madison Square Garden.'
b'Unfortunately for the Knicks, the rules have been changed some this year, and having the very worst record does not offer any advantage. The three worst teams, one of whom is virtually certain to be the Knicks, all will have an identical 14 percent chance of landing the top pick. If the Knicks really are tanking to get a lower lottery spot, they can probably stop now.'

b'GREENSBORO, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 As advanced statistical analysis and its attendant new technology continue to reshape how sports are understood, watched and even played \xe2\x80\x94 when to punt on fourth down in football, where to position a baseball team\xe2\x80\x99s infielders and how to build a winning basketball team \xe2\x80\x94 these new numbers also create a vexing problem:'
b'How to account for what complex algorithms cannot explain.'
b'The thirst for information is such that one essential set of college basketball data that will help determine the field for this month\xe2\x80\x99s N.C.A.A. tournament, Ken Pomeroy\xe2\x80\x99s eponymous KenPom ratings, includes a metric to shed light on when things do not actually go by the numbers.'
b'Pomeroy has a rather analog term for it: luck.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLuck is basically performance in close games,\xe2\x80\x9d Pomeroy said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople generally don\xe2\x80\x99t like the term \xe2\x80\x98luck\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s the feedback I get. Technically, I\xe2\x80\x99d call it \xe2\x80\x98randomness\xe2\x80\x99 or something a lot more wordy, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit well above a column.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In short, KenPom\xe2\x80\x99s luck factor considers the difference between a team\xe2\x80\x99s record and what the data would expect it to be. If a team\xe2\x80\x99s record is better than its predictive numbers, it is lucky. If it is worse, then it is unlucky.'
b'This season, according to the KenPom ratings, no team among the 353 Division I college men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball programs has been luckier than the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.'
b'The Spartans resemble a team one might expect from a coach, Wes Miller, who transferred to North Carolina as a walk-on, then earned a letter on a national championship team and eventually a spot in the starting lineup. They are resourceful and determined, and have the ethos (and the recruiting budget) of an underdog.'
b'Greensboro has a 28-6 record \xe2\x80\x94 the best in program history \xe2\x80\x94 and finished second in the Southern Conference, behind Wofford, which was ranked 20th in this week\xe2\x80\x99s Associated Press poll.'
b'Did luck have something to do with it?'
b'Miller, pulling up a folding chair before a recent practice, reacted as one might expect. He praised Pomeroy as \xe2\x80\x9ca genius,\xe2\x80\x9d expressed fascination with analytics and said there were others on his staff who delve deeper into the data to provide the most salient information about the Spartans and their opponents.'
b'Then he assumed a defensive stance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a mathematician,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a basketball coach who\xe2\x80\x99s always trying to figure out an edge to help me coach better. But there\xe2\x80\x99s never been anybody that could put a number on will and togetherness of group.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in our games that\xe2\x80\x99s indescribable to his data that\xe2\x80\x99s getting us over the hump,\xe2\x80\x9d Miller added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s toughness. That\xe2\x80\x99s the ability to win close games. The proudest I ever am as a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and things don\xe2\x80\x99t go our way and we still find a way because our team was able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the hump.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Francis Alonso, a senior guard from Malaga, Spain, who is the heartbeat of his team, put it another way: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s this saying \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s champions\xe2\x80\x99 luck.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Alan Castel, a psychology professor at U.C.L.A. who studies memory and metacognition \xe2\x80\x94 how we think about our thinking \xe2\x80\x94 said that while confidence (or the lack of it) is a fundamental element of athletic competition, it is often misplaced.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe human mind doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on big data,\xe2\x80\x9d said Castel, whose research has debunked the hot-hand theory \xe2\x80\x94 the belief that a team should get the ball to a shooter who is on a hot streak. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re prone to rely on illusions and small sample sizes and what we want to think.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'If Greensboro\xe2\x80\x99s Spartans are the luckiest team in the country, he said, they deserve some of the credit for it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo be lucky, you need to put yourself in a situation,\xe2\x80\x9d Castel said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo win the lottery, you need to buy a ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Or, he added, to win the N.C.A.A. tournament, you need to get in. And to do that, the Spartans almost certainly will require a little more luck.'
b'Some years ago, a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 like the Spartans\xe2\x80\x99 might have looked glossier. They have a sparkling record, are 7-0 in games decided by 5 points or fewer and have been competitive in defeats at 10th-ranked Louisiana State (97-91) and sixth-ranked Kentucky (78-61), a game that they led with less than nine minutes left. But they lost to Wofford twice in the regular season \xe2\x80\x94 by 29 and 30 points \xe2\x80\x94 and for a third time on Monday night, 70-58, in the Southern Conference tournament championship game.'
b'Yet it is this profile \xe2\x80\x94 a team that has squeaked past bad teams, competed against good ones and been pounded only twice, by the best team in its conference \xe2\x80\x94 that explains why Greensboro\xe2\x80\x99s luck factor is +.175, which, if it holds until the season is over, would be the highest of any team since 2013.'
b'What that figure means, Pomeroy said, is that in a luck-free environment, the Spartans\xe2\x80\x99 winning percentage would be 0.175 lower than it is. As a result, they would have six fewer victories \xe2\x80\x94 and a 22-12 record \xe2\x80\x94 without any luck.'
b'There are real-world consequences: Through Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s games, Greensboro ranked 81st in KenPom\xe2\x80\x99s overall ratings, lagging behind East Tennessee State (71st) and Furman (55th), against whom they combined to win four of five games this season. (The N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s new NET metric, which the tournament selection committee is using to evaluate teams this year, is only slightly kinder: It has the Spartans 58th.)'
b'Once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week, with a broad spectrum of schools from around the country, a clearer picture will emerge of whether teams that have been deemed to have enjoyed metric good fortune have punched above their weight all season.'
b'The Spartans, at this point, would consider themselves lucky to have the chance.'

b'Zion Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s legend grows with every game these days, with each new thundering dunk and every stunning new feat of elevation. It has been this way for several years now, with Williamson the featured actor in a growing collection of viral clips that show a player with the skills to outrun almost anyone, to catch almost anything, to challenge almost anybody. Even his lowest moments \xe2\x80\x94 the sneaker that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold him, the injured knee that cost him five games \xe2\x80\x94 have somehow morphed into highlights. But Williamson, an 18-year-old Duke freshman, has been making memorable moments for years. A group of New York Times reporters tracked down some of the people who were present for a few of them, to ask them about the memories that stand out the most.'
b'By Kevin Armstrong'
b'Forgive Tom Konchalski.'
b'The publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated first observed Zion Williamson in person at the Elite 24, an all-star showcase for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top prep prospects, on Aug. 20, 2016. The court at Pier 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park was the stage, and Williamson was 10 for 10 from the field, scored 23 points and shared most valuable player honors. Konchalski was impressed.'
b'To Konchalski\xe2\x80\x99s well-trained eye \xe2\x80\x94 in five decades he had amassed an inventory of reports that stretched from Michael Jordan to LeBron James \xe2\x80\x94 Williamson, who had just turned 16, appeared to be an interior technician, a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finishes. Because of Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s body type, Konchalski considered him a left-handed Jamal Mashburn, a reference to the beefy Bronx product who played 11 seasons in the N.B.A.'
b'When Konchalski sat down at his typewriter after the Elite 24 to describe Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s effort, he wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9c6-foot-5 junior Zion Williamson, the master of quiet domination, provided a bit of fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Looking back, Konchalski says now, he got it all wrong.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wiping off copious amounts of egg from my face,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Williamson, he knows, \xe2\x80\x9cis anything but quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d '

b'The first time LeBron James showed up to watch Zion Williamson, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him in the door.'
b'It was July 2017, and James, once a transcendent teenage talent himself, went to see Williamson, the next big thing, at a showcase in Las Vegas. Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s team, South Carolina Supreme, was playing Big Baller Brand, which featured LaMelo Ball, a brother of Lakers guard Lonzo Ball. It was, by summer youth basketball standards, a must-see event.'
b'James, of course, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust. The N.B.A. players Damian Lillard, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray and Thon Maker were in the gym by the time James arrived, adding buzz to a crowd of more than 4,000 that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold less than half that many.'
b'Even in warm-ups, the excitement was palpable. The fans oohed and aahed as Williamson tossed balls high in the air and dunked them; many spectators held cellphones, the better to share video clips of a scene that was quickly called the \xe2\x80\x9ccraziest A.A.U. game ever.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'But James never saw any of it. With fans standing a dozen deep, nearly spilling onto the court from every direction, he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk. A teenager\xe2\x80\x99s mere presence, it seemed, had squeezed out basketball\xe2\x80\x99s biggest star. James was told he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come in.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shut him down,\xe2\x80\x9d an Adidas marketing executive told CBS Sports at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cThe corners were 500 deep. That\xe2\x80\x99s where it got insane.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'It would be a year and a half before James got to see Williamson play in person. In February, he took a 35-minute flight from Philadelphia to Charlottesville, Va., and watched from courtside as Williamson, playing for Duke, went for 18 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a win against Virginia. Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s athleticism, James declared, was \xe2\x80\x9cridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'By David Waldstein'
b'Bishop Richardson was averaging about three alley-oop assists to Williamson every game when their team, Spartanburg (S.C.) Day School, arrived at Ben Lippen School in Columbia, S.C., for a game during Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s junior year. '
b'Williamson dunked a lot back then, and he had recorded at least two slams in the first half that had the gym rocking. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember it vividly,\xe2\x80\x9d Williamson said last week. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir student section was really into the game, talking a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The real highlight, though, was still to come. With Spartanburg ahead by 39 points, Richardson, a spindly guard who had played varsity since the eighth grade, found himself jogging easily up the right sideline when he spotted Williamson closing menacingly down the other side of the court. He tried another lob; he knew the pass didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be perfect.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you threw it anywhere near the rim,\xe2\x80\x9d Richardson said, \xe2\x80\x9che was going to get it.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'On this occasion, Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s toss arrived well below the rim. But that enabled Williamson to do something outrageous: He rose into the air, reached out with two hands to grab the incoming pass at about shoulder height, and \xe2\x80\x94 still rising, now high enough to peer inside the rim he was about to shake \xe2\x80\x94 used one sweeping, circular motion to bring the ball down to his waist and then back up to the left side of his body before ramming it through the basket with his left hand.'
b'The crowd erupted. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI remember thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Holy cow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anyone do anything like that, let alone be a part of it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Richardson said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were falling out of the bleachers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The dunk made it onto highlight reels and national sports shows within hours, but Richardson did not see a replay until the next day, when he and teammates sneaked a peek in a study hall.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could take credit for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Richardson said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was completely accidental.\xe2\x80\x9d '

b'Vertical leap is measured using a simple contraption: a tall pole with a series of long, metal fingers that project horizontally from it on top of one another \xe2\x80\x94 narrow wings stacked up, up, up, at consistent increments. It may seem lo-fi, but it is also foolproof: Your vertical reach while jumping is the highest metal flange you are able to bat away from its set position. Subtract standing vertical reach from that number, and you have a player\xe2\x80\x99s vertical leap. '
b'When Duke put its players through the test one day last summer, Zion Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s vertical leap was measured at 46 inches. But to the teammates and Duke staff members who were present, mere numbers do not do the moment justice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe were all in shock,\xe2\x80\x9d the sophomore guard Alex O\xe2\x80\x99Connell said. '
b'Williamson, who went last, was off the charts. On his first attempt, he casually swatted aside the highest measurement. A staff member adjusted the pole to its highest setting and reset the tabs, and Williamson repeated the feat. They put weights under the contraption to lift it a few more inches into the air. Williamson batted the highest measurements aside again. '
b"\xe2\x80\x9cIt was something you don't see a lot, especially with a guy who is built like him flying through the air,\xe2\x80\x9d forward Javin DeLaurier said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a sight to behold.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'Nolan Smith, an assistant coach who played for four years at Duke and several more in the N.B.A. and Europe, said he had never seen anything like it. Cam Reddish, another Blue Devils\xe2\x80\x99 freshman, said he missed out; he said he was in another part of the building when Williamson tested the test itself. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just heard that he broke the record,\xe2\x80\x9d Reddish said. \xe2\x80\x9cZion things.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'By Kevin Draper'
b'In the beginning, the former Duke standout Jay Williams kept track of the Williamson hype the same way everybody else did: through low-quality video clips shot in high school gyms and then posted on the internet. Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s high-flying plays quickly became \xe2\x80\x9cthe eighth wonder of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said.'
b'Then he saw him in person. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen a player casually do a 360 in a game,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said of seeing Williamson do precisely that in a game against Clemson this season. \xe2\x80\x9cEven when you saw Vince do it in college,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to Vince Carter, who played at the University of North Carolina, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was a level of oomph that he needed to exert that type of energy. My man casually did it in the game. He did a 360 like I would do a layup.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Williams said plays like that one were the reason comparing Williamson to other basketball players is a mistake. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, I was looking at a football player who had the finesse of basketball ability,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen that before. I played against Julius Peppers in college. I remember him being the only guy Carlos Boozer was somewhat intimidated to go against because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just move him around. I remember thinking for the first time: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I was looking at Julius Peppers but through a basketball lens. What? What?\xe2\x80\x99 Julius was agile, but I am talking about the frame of the body. It reminded me of a linebacker or a tight end. Just different.\xe2\x80\x9d '

b'Spike Lee was in his seat and Barack Obama was settled in his, down past the end of the Duke bench. But in front of North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Luke Maye \xe2\x80\x94 in the space where Zion Williamson had stood a moment earlier \xe2\x80\x94 there was suddenly \xe2\x80\xa6 nothing. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything, man,\xe2\x80\x9d Maye said Thursday. '
b'What everyone quickly realized was that the story had quickly changed from a heated rivalry game \xe2\x80\x94 top-ranked Duke vs. No. 8 North Carolina \xe2\x80\x94 into something far more bizarre: Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s Nike sneaker had broken apart as he made a move at the free-throw line. He was down. North Carolina was racing upcourt. And everyone else was asking: What just happened? '
b'Maye, in that moment, had the best seat in the house. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just took the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand just started going.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Initially, the Blue Devils were just as confused. The first thing Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Javin DeLaurier saw from his spot on the bench was the sneaker on Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s left foot, or what was left of it, anyway: Its sole was flapping free, like a banner in the wind.'
b'To DeLaurier, this counted as good news.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s just his shoe,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a sigh of relief.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He had, after all, seen this before. He had blown out a shoe before. He had seen Williamson do it, too. \xe2\x80\x9cZion\xe2\x80\x99s a big human being, moving pretty fast, changing direction,\xe2\x80\x9d DeLaurier said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'By David Waldstein'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI consider it my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d De\xe2\x80\x99Andre Hunter says now.'
b'He\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong. Late in a February game at Virginia, Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy whipped the ball crosscourt to his teammate De\xe2\x80\x99Andre Hunter, who waited at the 3-point line, deep in the corner, and without a Duke player within 15 feet of him. Williamson was on the left side of the court, playing his usual feisty, active defense, so Hunter, in the right corner, took his time uncoiling the 3-point attempt.'
b'Williamson, though, had closed the gap by then. Soaring across the court with five quick steps, he took off from about six feet away just as Hunter unloaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider it my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI took way too long setting it up and releasing the shot. But he came a long way.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'In fact, Williamson jumped so high and stretched so vertically that his right hand was well above the height of the 10-foot rim when he cleanly swatted Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s shot into the stands. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe just came out of nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said. '
b'Worse news, at least for Hunter, was that the clip made its way to ESPN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSportsCenter\xe2\x80\x9d and other highlight shows, and it is now a staple of the Williamson YouTube filmography. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was going to be such a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said recently.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, was asked about the concept of inevitability before his team faced the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night, which is something that happens during the N.B.A. playoffs. Some questions are more philosophical than others.'
b'In this case, the question had to do with the perception shared by many that the Warriors are invincible, that another championship is theirs to lose: What is it like for Kerr to live inside that bubble, knowing full well that his players are capable of making mistakes and even (gasp) failing?'
b'Kerr took the opportunity to recall a moment from his childhood in Southern California. When he was 9 years old, he watched his beloved U.C.L.A. Bruins defeat the Kentucky Wildcats for another N.C.A.A. championship, their 10th in 12 years. Coach John Wooden retired after the game. In the nearly half-century since, U.C.L.A. has won one championship \xe2\x80\x94 in 1995, when Bob Myers, now the general manager of the Warriors, was a reserve forward.'
b'Kerr made sure to note that coincidence. But his larger point was about how sports are unpredictable, which is one of the reasons they are so appealing. Just as no one knew, for example, that the Warriors would make the wrong kind of history by blowing a 31-point lead on Monday, no one knew that they would bounce back on Thursday by obliterating the Clippers, 132-105, in Game 3 of their first-round series.'
b'At the same time, no one knows whether the Warriors will go on to win a third straight championship \xe2\x80\x94 or how long this team will remain intact. Nothing is inevitable. Everything is uncertain. All dynasties end.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust go out there and play and do your best and see if you can sustain it for a long time. But everything comes to an end, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to keep this going for as long as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The central (if unmentioned) figure in all of this, of course, is Kevin Durant, who has taken on all comers this season in the form of a 7-foot, long-limbed question mark. Bound for free agency this summer, Durant could stay with the Warriors, with whom he has already won two championships \xe2\x80\x94 but most expect him to go. Who knows? The agita has sometimes clouded his team\xe2\x80\x99s season.'
b'The only sure thing is his basketball genius, which still belongs to the Warriors \xe2\x80\x94 for now if not forever \xe2\x80\x94 and was on display Thursday night against the Clippers, as he helped lift Golden State to a two-games-to-one lead in the series. Game 4 is Sunday at Staples Center.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly,\xe2\x80\x9d Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey dissected us.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was a resounding statement by the Warriors in the wake of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s fiasco, and no player was more electric or dynamic than Durant, who made all five of his shots in the first quarter \xe2\x80\x94 and somehow seemed to improve as the night went on. He finished with 38 points and 7 assists, shooting 14 of 23 from the field.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe came out super aggressive, in kill mode,\xe2\x80\x9d the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 Draymond Green said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was all the difference for us.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Durant\xe2\x80\x99s explosion in Game 3 followed a couple of muted efforts for him early in the series. Defended by the Clippers\xe2\x80\x99 Patrick Beverley, a 6-foot-1 guard whom Durant has described in recent days as both a \xe2\x80\x9cpit bull\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cpest,\xe2\x80\x9d Durant managed 23 points before he was ejected in Game 1, then struggled even more in Game 2: 21 points and 9 turnovers while shooting just 5 of 8 from the field.'
b'At practice this week, Durant had a scrum with the news media that felt more like a doctoral defense. He explained his approach on offense. He talked about strategy and chemistry and shot selection and rhythm. He may have mentioned the officiating once or twice. He also offered a reminder in case anyone had forgotten.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Kevin Durant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'After Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Durant said the only difference was that the team had run more plays for him while putting him in better positions to score, often on the low block. Consider: He scored 27 points in the first half but did not make a single 3-pointer. His mentality, he said, never changes. He was not going to force bad shots. He was not going to turn his matchup with Beverley into some sort of me-first duel.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t do that type of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Durant said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just play.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Warriors have had one bad stretch against the Clippers in this series, and it cost them. But they clearly seem more together and more resilient than they were back in November, when they visited Staples Center and lost to the Clippers in overtime after Green and Durant barked at each other on the bench, then feuded in the locker room. The team wound up suspending Green for a game. Durant, annoyed at questions about free agency, later boycotted the news media for about two weeks. The cracks were showing. Was the dynasty crumbling?'
b'The last few days, then, were in some ways a microcosm of their season: The Warriors reassembled the pieces. They recognize how fragile this all is, how rare their opportunity. And if they needed a reminder, they got one in Game 2 when DeMarcus Cousins, their starting center, tore a quadriceps muscle. He will likely miss the rest of the postseason. In his absence, the rest of them will go on \xe2\x80\x94 with an understanding that this run will not last forever.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe realize how lucky we are to do this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Klay Thompson, their All-Star shooting guard. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave it out there. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s ever guaranteed in the future, so play to win now and do it collectively.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'BOSTON \xe2\x80\x94 Jayson Tatum boomed on LeBron James in last year\xe2\x80\x99s N.B.A. playoffs. You may remember it. Tatum, the 21-year-old swingman for the Boston Celtics, certainly does.'
b'The dunk drew a \xe2\x80\x9cwow\xe2\x80\x9d from the play-by-play broadcaster Mike Breen. A reporter wrote on Twitter that in the locker room afterward, he overheard James saying that Tatum had \xe2\x80\x9cboomed\xe2\x80\x9d him, before James repeated four times, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so good.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big-ass picture of it in my house,\xe2\x80\x9d Tatum said in a post-practice interview on Tuesday.'
b'The dunk came in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of last year\xe2\x80\x99s Eastern Conference finals. Starting from outside the 3-point line, Tatum took two dribbles with his left hand to get to the rim before hammering a right-handed dunk past James, who attempted a block as a helpless defender. Tatum followed the booming with a chest bump of James, one of his boyhood idols, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Celtics lost that game, but the dunk solidified Tatum, who played one season at Duke, as an emerging N.B.A. star.'
b'After the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 disappointing regular-season run this season, Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s star hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been as bright so far in these playoffs as Boston faces the Indiana Pacers in the first round. He did not make the leap many had thought he would: While he improved as a rebounder and passer, his shot selection led to more long 2-pointers, causing his true shooting percentage to dip from .586 in his rookie campaign to .547 this year, placing him below .560, the league average.'
b'He increased his frequency of midrange jumpers but decreased his accuracy in making them: 37 percent, down from 44 percent. Many of his advanced metric statistics, including win shares per 48 minutes, value over replacement player and box plus/minus, were worse this year.'
b'Tatum finds himself in an unusual spot, compared with fellow N.B.A. sophomores like Utah\xe2\x80\x99s Donovan Mitchell and Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Simmons. The better Tatum plays, especially in this postseason, the more likely he is to be linked to trade rumors, particularly those involving Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans star who has requested a trade that could shift the competitive balance in the N.B.A.'
b'Several college starters in this year\xe2\x80\x99s Final Four were older than Tatum. But if he cannot live up to the hype he created in last year\xe2\x80\x99s playoffs \xe2\x80\x94 that is, if he becomes just another guard \xe2\x80\x94 the Pelicans may be more likely to accept a package from the Los Angeles Lakers or another team besides Boston. At the same time, if Celtics point guard Kyrie Irving opts for free agency this summer, the future of the franchise may rest on Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. At barely 21, he\xe2\x80\x99d be the alpha.'
b'Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s future is more uncertain than many other players who have received significant early acclaim. But one way or another, the Celtics need Tatum to be great. Not just for this year\xe2\x80\x99s playoffs, but for the future.'
b'In short, they need him to boom.'
b'In a conversation at the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 practice facility about his future and the atypical stakes, Tatum had talking points at the ready, ones that he had delivered multiple times before. He stared straight ahead, not making eye contact, as if he were running through the script in his head.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrade rumors don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his deep monotone. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re talking about trading me for guys like Anthony Davis. So, I mean, I must be doing something pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d When pressed on whether this bothered him, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t budge: \xe2\x80\x9cI love the game of basketball. Being traded is part of the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ll play for whomever. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I can\xe2\x80\x99t control.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much more to say than that. But that is Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s personality, Brad Stevens, the Celtics\xe2\x80\x99 head coach, said. No distractions. That, Stevens said, is his best quality.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstances don\xe2\x80\x99t affect him,\xe2\x80\x9d Stevens said. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst game of the season, he\xe2\x80\x99s unaffected by the jitters that everybody has. Seventh game of a playoff series? Unaffected. At least, he shows himself to be unaffected, and he can thrive in that environment.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Stevens said Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s quality of play had improved as he got deeper into the season. He became a better passer, averaging 2.8 assists after the All-Star break, compared with 1.9 before. But his shooting dipped, from 38 percent from deep before the break to 35 percent afterward.'
b'Last season, Tatum benefited from the low expectations for the Celtics after injuries to Irving, forward Gordon Hayward and the reserve center Daniel Theis. But he also helped carry Boston to within one win of an unlikely N.B.A. finals appearance. This year, \xe2\x80\x9cunlikely\xe2\x80\x9d is not in the playoff vocabulary. The Celtics are supposed to get there. And Boston\xe2\x80\x99s fans, never the most positive bunch, can turn on a player in a second. If the Celtics do not advance, after many analysts predicted they would, fans may view Tatum\xe2\x80\x99s season in a harsh light, given how much of the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes are tied up with him.'
b'Tatum said he was not as nervous about the playoffs this time around. Taking a daily pregame nap with his 16-month-old son has helped. The early returns have been positive: In the first game of the series against the Pacers, Tatum scored 15 points on 11 shots. He was plus-11 in 34 minutes as the Celtics ran away with a win. In Game 2, Tatum was even better. He scored 26 points on 20 shots, including multiple thunderous dunks in the fourth quarter, helping Boston take a 2-0 lead in the series.'
b'But there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a highlight that has matched the dunk on James. Tatum shook his head no when asked if he had ever talked to James about that play. A hint of a grin betrayed his practiced demeanor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey won, so they got the last laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d Tatum said.'

b'ATLANTA \xe2\x80\x94 Kyle Kuzma had his first interaction with LeBron James a little more than a year ago, when Kuzma was a first-year forward with the Los Angeles Lakers and James was a few months from dragging the Cleveland Cavaliers to another appearance in the N.B.A. finals. Kuzma had reached out by phone, hoping for some tips.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust wanted to see how one of the greats takes care of his body and has so much longevity,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuzma recalled this week in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wants to play basketball for as long as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'So much has changed since that initial conversation. Kuzma and James are teammates now, and Kuzma is experiencing the unique challenges that come with playing alongside one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s behemoths. At the same time, James\xe2\x80\x99s body finally betrayed him this season, which has only heightened the sense of urgency within the organization: The Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for five years running, are not in position for a patient rebuild.'
b'James, at 34, may still be in his prime, but the stakes are already high for a franchise that desperately wants to maximize his time in Los Angeles. And while neither James nor Lakers management has shown much enthusiasm for coaxing along a young core \xe2\x80\x94 the Lakers tried to ship half the roster to New Orleans last week \xe2\x80\x94 they are stuck in this together. James was supposed to be the savior of a flagship franchise gone astray; salvaging the final months of this year would be a key indicator that he still wields that type of power.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to approach the rest of the season just like you would during the playoffs,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuzma said.'
b'As Kuzma recalled his talk with James, he had no way of knowing that the Lakers were mere hours from suffering one final implosion before the N.B.A. All-Star break \xe2\x80\x94 a 117-113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks that left the team with a losing record and ample opportunity for soul searching.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to get away and reflect a little bit about where we are as a group,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Luke Walton said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this first part of the season, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through a lot of adversity. And we\xe2\x80\x99re probably not where we want to be, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still close enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Close enough, that is, for vying for a spot in the playoffs, which was both an indication of the team\xe2\x80\x99s modest goals and its sad reality. At 28-29, the Lakers are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings. It is unfamiliar territory for James, who has not been on a losing team this late in a season since he was a first-year forward with the Cavaliers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut with LeBron on your team, anything is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mychal Thompson, a power forward for the Showtime-era Lakers and an analyst for the team\xe2\x80\x99s radio broadcasts. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, look at some of the teams he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to the finals \xe2\x80\x94 including last season. He\xe2\x80\x99s capable of doing great things if you just get on board and run with him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers, though, seem fragile after nearly five months of drama \xe2\x80\x94 all of it stemming directly or indirectly from the $154 million deal that James signed to join the team last summer. The pressure was on from the start, and little has gone according to plan.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been more noise this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that was to be expected with the moves in the off-season. That was something to be anticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Where to begin? Brandon Ingram and Rajon Rondo were suspended for trying to brawl with the Houston Rockets two games into the season. Magic Johnson, the team\xe2\x80\x99s outspoken president of basketball operations, chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting for the team\xe2\x80\x99s slow start, igniting lasting questions about Walton\xe2\x80\x99s job security. Nearly every player on the roster has been injured, and that includes James, who missed 17 games with a strained groin.'
b'And lest we forget: Last week, Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka tried to trade away nearly half the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans for Anthony Davis, who, before the start of the season, hired the same agent who represents James. It was the clearest sign yet that Johnson is willing to attempt the very boldest moves \xe2\x80\x94 no matter the residual damage.'
b'Consider that the Lakers, amid their ultimately fruitless effort to pry Davis away from the Pelicans, lost by 42 points to the Indiana Pacers. And with rumors of which Lakers would be traded swirling through social media, it was difficult to find arguments in their defense \xe2\x80\x94 even from James himself.'
b'Kuzma, who was offered up as one of the pieces in a potential deal, said it had been difficult to drown out the noise.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s definitely tough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause this generation, you\xe2\x80\x99re always on your phone, always on social media, always seeing it somewhere on TV.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But the trade deadline passed, and the roster more or less remained intact. There had been a sense that a surprising win against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 7 would galvanize the team in the wake of so much uncertainty. And even after losing to the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, the Lakers still had a chance to build some momentum against the Hawks on Tuesday.'
b'Before the game, James appeared to be in an upbeat mood. In the locker room, he knelt on a giant inflatable ball as he worked on some core-strengthening exercises. He crooned the lyrics to \xe2\x80\x9cPlug Walk\xe2\x80\x9d by the hip-hop artist Rich the Kid. He made small talk with Ingram. It was all vintage James.'
b'About three hours later, once the Lakers had punctuated their loss with a turnover, James made a beeline off the court and into the tunnel. He was practically steaming. He had finished with his fifth triple-double of the season \xe2\x80\x94 28 points, 16 assists, 11 rebounds \xe2\x80\x94 but the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 defense was as porous as a coffee filter, and the result was just as messy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can throw that game in the trash,\xe2\x80\x9d James said.'
b'In a three-minute postgame session with reporters, Kuzma mentioned the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d five times \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, the notion that the Lakers were not having much of it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of times we\xe2\x80\x99re out there with sad faces, very focused faces,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuzma said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we\xe2\x80\x99re at our best when we\xe2\x80\x99re having fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fun may not be the primary objective for James, and the psychic effects of the loss are sure to linger until at least Feb. 21, when their season will resume after the All-Star break with a home game against the Houston Rockets. For now, though, the best thing for these players may be to be away from each other for a while, which was one of Walton\xe2\x80\x99s suggestions before they parted for the break.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpend some time by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a group that will be ready by the time we get back.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 To celebrate their first home win in 25 days, the Lakers on Sunday dropped streamers that had been collecting dust from the ceiling at Staples Center. The final lineup of the night included Alex Caruso, a 25-year-old guard who spent most of the season in the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s developmental G League.'
b'Caruso knows things were not supposed to be this way. His mere presence \xe2\x80\x94 in a crunchtime situation, no less \xe2\x80\x94 was a vivid sign that the season had gone sideways for the Lakers, who will be watching the playoffs from various vacation destinations.'
b'Caruso also knows that the Lakers are playing fairly meaningless games, including Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 111-106 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers (32-41) have nine more of these to go, starting Tuesday against the Washington Wizards. The buzz of LeBron James\xe2\x80\x99s first season as a Laker is gone. The roster will be overhauled again this summer as the franchise, which has not been to the playoffs since 2013, rummages for solutions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Caruso said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese games are really meaningful.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers are searching for motivation wherever they can find it, especially as they head toward an off-season of uncertainty. Coach Luke Walton\xe2\x80\x99s job status is tenuous at best, and 10 players on the current roster do not have guaranteed deals for next season. Some of them, like Caruso, are trying to showcase their skills in hopes of acquiring N.B.A. work next season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think this little stretch has been really good,\xe2\x80\x9d Caruso said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s finally allowed me to put all that work I\xe2\x80\x99ve put in over the last two years and show how much I\xe2\x80\x99ve evolved as a player. That I\xe2\x80\x99m gaining confidence and making strides to get better and better.\xe2\x80\x9d In 16 appearances for the Lakers this season, Caruso has shot 44.6 percent from the field, averaging 6 points and 2.2 rebounds.'
b'Even players who figure to be a part of the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s future are focusing on personal growth. A team is always a collection of individuals, but the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 late-season emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d is particularly understandable.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI need to use these games to develop myself and play with the ball more,\xe2\x80\x9d the second-year forward Kyle Kuzma said recently.'
b'The Lakers were not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention when they lost to the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 17 \xe2\x80\x94 that would happen five days later \xe2\x80\x94 but Kuzma stood by his locker in a red leather jumpsuit after the game and spoke about the immediate future.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to use these last 13, 14 games \xe2\x80\x94 whatever we have \xe2\x80\x94 to just try to develop good habits,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSeason\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much over, so that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I can really do. Everyone knows I\xe2\x80\x99m a good scorer and I can do that. I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to complete my game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Then there are the injured players who have largely disappeared from view: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart. For them, the end of this season is about rehabbing for the next one.'
b'After all the losses, injuries and general dysfunction, Walton continues to preach the importance of team play. Same as ever.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt starts with our effort and how we play and how we compete,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd our guys have been doing a nice job of that, even though we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been winning games. Whatever lineups we\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting out there, they\xe2\x80\x99re giving what they have. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the No. 1 thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As for James, these are his first truly inconsequential games since his rookie season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who finished well out of playoff contention. But even then, he could use the end of the season as an opportunity to hone his abilities and gain experience for future endeavors \xe2\x80\x94 such as eight consecutive trips to the N.B.A. Finals.'
b'So it is a credit to James, even as the grease fire of his first season with the Lakers smolders, that he is out there \xe2\x80\x94 trying. Against the Kings, he finished with his 81st career triple-double: 29 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds. How does he sustain the motivation?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s out there on the court, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give what he has,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s probably a better question for him, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting to know him, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of person he is: He respects and loves the game. So if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to play, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give what he has.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'James said he appreciated the fans who continued to show up. He also said he owed it to himself to play with genuine effort.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always respected the basketball gods,\xe2\x80\x9d James said, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I\xe2\x80\x99m on the floor, I got to try to play as hard as I can or do something to affect the game and not cheat the game.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Still, times have changed for the Lakers, who have not been to the playoffs since 2013. Before that, they routinely fixated on the Western Conference standings and the number of wins they would need to make the playoffs. Now, the most important number in their universe is 3 percent \xe2\x80\x94 as in, their odds of winning the N.B.A. draft lottery.'
b'Then again, the Lakers are not the only team that has so little at stake at this stage of the season. Look no further than the Kings, whose push for a playoff berth has deteriorated in recent weeks. Before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game, Coach Dave Joerger held a brief news conference. No one had much to ask.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can give you some more stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s sunny out. It\xe2\x80\x99s spring. It smells like March Madness, Lent and the N.B.A. playoffs. Get the seedings, get it done. Exciting times.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He paused again.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'
b'Nothing else.'

b'The N.C.A.A. said on Saturday that it was appealing a Federal District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that N.C.A.A. member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s chief legal officer, said in a statement.'
b'Remy said the decision to appeal, by the N.C.A.A. and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.'
b'The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the N.C.A.A. than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball players and football players, had hoped.'
b'The suit, known as Alston after a lead plaintiff, argued that the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s rules barring payments to players \xe2\x80\x94 the center of what the association terms the collegiate model, and what is broadly known as amateurism \xe2\x80\x94 was illegal collusion. It asked the court to declare as much, and to eliminate all such rules, leaving it up to individual conferences to set caps independently if they so chose.'
b'Instead, while Judge Wilken agreed that the rules were illegal, she found that an alternative, in which the N.C.A.A. continued to restrict payments unless they were tied to education, was acceptable. Under her ruling, colleges could give athletes items like computers, but the N.C.A.A. could continue to bar them from receiving cash in express exchange for their athletic contributions.'
b'Judge Wilken cited a 2015 ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a similar case, in which a three-judge panel partially insisted that payment to athletes be \xe2\x80\x9ctethered to education.\xe2\x80\x9d The same appellate court \xe2\x80\x94 albeit probably three different judges \xe2\x80\x94 would hear this appeal.'
b'While the N.C.A.A. largely welcomed Judge Wilken\xe2\x80\x99s finding when it was handed down, it said on Saturday that it sought more: to get the courts out of regulating college athletics as much as possible.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the district court upheld the distinction between full-time students who play college sports and professional athletes, it erred by giving itself authority to micromanage decisions about education-related support,\xe2\x80\x9d Remy said.'
b'Jeffrey Kessler, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said of the appeal in a text message on Saturday morning: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not surprised. It was a major defeat for the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The rapper was not pleased that the Minnesota Timberwolves mocked his performance in Milwaukee. He put a curse on the team.'
b'By Benjamin Hoffman'
b'Sports curses come in all shapes and sizes. They can involve livestock, soup commercials, magazine covers and, frequently, the selling of star players.'
b'In recent years, the rapper Lil B has made a name for himself in the sports realm with his curses \xe2\x80\x94 most notably on James Harden of the Houston Rockets \xe2\x80\x94 but it appears he has some new competition: the rapper Ja Rule.'
b'It all started on Saturday, when Ja Rule was performing at halftime of a game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the host Milwaukee Bucks.'
b'The performance came on the 17th anniversary of Ja Rule\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with Ashanti, \xe2\x80\x9cAlways Be On Time,\xe2\x80\x9d hitting No. 1 on Billboard\xe2\x80\x99s Hot 100. But the show came under criticism immediately because of a somewhat misleading video of the crowd reaction and another one showing an unexpected guest: Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks\xe2\x80\x99 star forward, who came out to begin warming up for the second half while Ja Rule was still performing on the court along with a group of dancers.'
b'The rapper initially shrugged off the criticism, but his tone changed when the Timberwolves decided to mock the performance on social media. In a post to Twitter, the team said \xe2\x80\x9cWe too were hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!\xe2\x80\x9d The post was a reference to an earlier post by Ja Rule about his role in the ill-fated Fyre Festival, a luxury music event in the Bahamas that failed spectacularly in 2017. '
b'The rapper was not amused.'
b'The potential effects of this particular curse are unclear, though. The Timberwolves have existed as a franchise for 30 seasons and not only have not won a championship, but they have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs once \xe2\x80\x94 in 2004. They are 28-31, putting them just outside legitimate playoff contention, and the notion that Karl-Anthony Towns is departing anytime soon \xe2\x80\x94 as Ja Rule suggested with \xe2\x80\x9cAND KAT IS LEAVING!!!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 seems unlikely, as he has signed a five-year contract extension that kicks in next year and guarantees him nearly $160 million.'
b'Of course, logic does not have to play a role in sports curses. The Chicago Cubs endured the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat for more than 70 years after the team asked the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern, William Sianis, to leave a game because his goat was bothering fans. That the team had not won a World Series in more than 30 years before the episode was treated as mostly irrelevant. '
b'Other popular curses have included one in which the athletes endorsing Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s Chunky Soup seemed to become injured at an extraordinary rate. Another claimed that athletes had their performance fall off after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated.'
b'The most famous, of course, is the Curse of the Bambino, which doomed the Boston Red Sox to lose after selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in December 1919. The jinx is credited by some with keeping the Red Sox from winning a World Series for 86 years, despite the first year of that stretch coming before the team sold Ruth, and the fact that the curse was barely mentioned in popular culture before George Vecsey wrote a column about it for The New York Times in 1986. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe also wrote a book in 1990 that popularized the phrase.'
b'At the very least, the talk of Ja Rule\xe2\x80\x99s curse was good news for Lil B, who spent part of the weekend trending on Twitter. He celebrated by retweeting various people saying Ja Rule was simply stealing a tactic that Lil B had already perfected.'

b'The Philadelphia 76er who made the greatest impact in Game 3 of the team\xe2\x80\x99s first-round playoff series against the Nets wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Ben Simmons, the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s reigning rookie of the year, who scored 31 points. Nor was it the team\xe2\x80\x99s most dominant player, Joel Embiid, who missed the game with knee tendinitis. Or the sharpshooter J.J. Redick. Or the four-time All Star Jimmy Butler.'
b'It was Tobias Harris, the oft-traded, oft-underappreciated power forward who has an ego compact enough to fit inside his white headband \xe2\x80\x94 with room to spare.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTobias was our bell-ringer tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d 76ers Coach Brett Brown said Thursday after the 131-115 win gave Philadelphia a two-games-to-one lead in the best-of-seven series, which resumes Saturday in Brooklyn.'
b'Harris finished with playoff career highs of 29 points and 16 rebounds and made all six of his 3-pointers. At 6-foot-9, he owned the perimeter against the Nets\xe2\x80\x99 smaller guards, and his work on defense was just as effective.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou start looking at Tobias\xe2\x80\x99s rebounds and what he did from the 3-point line,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud of him. He\xe2\x80\x99s good people, and he was fantastic tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Nets are the feel-good story of the postseason, given the expectations for them last fall. But after losses in the last two games, it would seem that chemistry, scrappiness and heart go only so far against a Philadelphia lineup with the most talent outside Golden State.'
b'Harris, who is from Dix Hills on Long Island, was the final piece of a Sixers team assembled to make a deep playoff run. In early February, amid the best season of his career, Harris was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers. He could have signed an $80 million contract extension with the Clippers in the last off-season but decided to gamble on himself instead. He elected to play out his final year and become an unrestricted free agent this summer in hopes of a max contract \xe2\x80\x94 and some stability.'
b'Having been traded five times in eight seasons, Harris would like to be able to drop off his dry cleaning, then wake up in the same city to pick it up. At 26, after an All-Star-caliber season, he is looking for a home. That might even be Philadelphia.'
b'He averaged 20 points and 7.9 rebounds this season in a total of 82 games with the Clippers and Sixers. In 27 regular-season games for Philadelphia, Harris averaged 18.2 points, tying him with Butler for second on the 76ers\xe2\x80\x99 scoring list, behind Embiid, who averaged 27.5.'
b'For Game 4, the 76ers may still be without Embiid, which means that they will again need balanced scoring from the rest of their talented cast. On Thursday, Philadelphia had three scorers with 26 or more points (Simmons, Harris, Redick). The last time the franchise accomplished that in a playoff game was Game 3 of the 1978 conference semifinals against the Knicks. That night, it was Julius Erving, George McGinnis and World B. Free.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt good,\xe2\x80\x9d Harris said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just came in knowing with Joel down, it was a big scoring loss we had out there. I had to be aggressive from the start. I got some good looks throughout the game. I was able to let it fly, and it felt good for it to go in.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a big game personally for myself and for the team, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'
b'Beyond basketball, Harris co-stars in the best buddy movie in the N.B.A., known as the Bobi + Tobi Show. In 2016, Harris and Boban Marjanovic, a 7-foot-3 Serbian center, developed a close bond while playing for the Detroit Pistons. They were then traded to the Clippers for Blake Griffin in January 2018. About a year later, they became a package deal headed to Philadelphia.'
b'The Clippers produced three web episodes of the \xe2\x80\x9cBobi + Tobi Show\xe2\x80\x9d focused on the pair\xe2\x80\x99s friendship and foibles. They took a SoulCycle class together. They attempted a dance lesson. The fun continued in Philadelphia, where a TV station did a quiz show segment with them, focusing on trivia about their new city. Neither could pronounce \xe2\x80\x9cSchuylkill.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In Game 3, Marjanovic played the sidekick during Harris\xe2\x80\x99s star turn. He came off the bench and split time with Greg Monroe, who had replaced Embiid in the starting lineup.'
b'Monroe and Marjanovic combined for 43 minutes and 21 of the Sixers\xe2\x80\x99 54 rebounds. With Harris defending on the perimeter, the load was lighter on the big men in the paint, though Marjanovic fouled out with about seven minutes left in the game.'
b'No matter. His buddy had his back. The game was in control, and Harris looked right at home.'

b'It was a humble TV listing, informing readers that the Knicks would be playing the Washington Bullets on MSG that night. The short item noted that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Knicks tried double-teaming Jeff Ruland in the second of those games, but the tactic didn\xe2\x80\x99t work: He responded with a triple double-digit effort \xe2\x80\x94 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was Dec. 29, 1984. And for the very first time, The New York Times had cited the triple-double.'
b'On Monday night, Russell Westbrook completed an unprecedented 10th consecutive triple-double, with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Portland Trail Blazers. Westbrook broke the record of nine, set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968.'
b'The moment Russ passed Wilt for the longest triple-double streak \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 pic.twitter.com/xTytZdyzDd'
b'But while triple-doubles are no longer uncommon \xe2\x80\x94 Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s teammate Paul George turned in an even more immpressive line (47 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists) on Monday \xe2\x80\x94 the term is relatively new. Like Chamberlain, some of the greatest practitioners made every one of their triple-doubles when triple-doubles were not even a thing.'
b'The Times quickly embraced the triple-double. Two days after its debut, the label made it into an ordinary sports article, this time without the clunky words \xe2\x80\x9cdigit\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ceffort.\xe2\x80\x9d Precedent had been set.'
b'In those early days, some of the references to triple-double in The Times were in quotes, as if editors were afraid that the new term would pollute the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s august pages. Eventually the arbiters of style settled on no quotes, and a hyphen in between the two words.'
b'The first triple-double in Basketball-Reference\xe2\x80\x99s database is from 1950, when Andy Phillip of the Philadelphia Warriors tallied 17 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, although there were almost certainly others before that when stat keeping was less precise and complete.'
b'Harvey Pollack, the longtime 76ers stats guru, is generally credited with inventing the term in the early 1980s, inspired by Magic Johnson, who made a habit of triple-doubling. (Ruland, though he was the Times\xe2\x80\x99s triple-double pioneer, claimed only five in his career.)'
b'There are also double-doubles \xe2\x80\x94 the career record is held by Chamberlain \xe2\x80\x94 and quadruple doubles, for those who can also manage 10 blocks or steals. That has only happened a handful of times in the N.B.A., and not since David Robinson in 1994.'
b'There are even quintuple doubles, a stupefying exploit \xe2\x80\x94 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals and 10 blocks \xe2\x80\x94 performed by the women\xe2\x80\x99s star Tamika Catchings when she was in high school in 1997.'
b'Westbrook has taken the triple-double to new heights, though, actually averaging a triple-double for the last two seasons. He is on pace to do so again this season. And unlike his early predecessors, he is keenly aware of the stat, often looking to add that one more assist or rebound that he needs late in a game.'
b'Westbrook now has 127 total triple-doubles, closing in on Johnson, the inspiration for the term, who has 138.'
b'But above all of them is Oscar Robertson, the only other man to average a triple-double; he had 181 in his Hall of Fame career.'
b'His last one came in 1974, when the feat was still unnamed, at least in The Times.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 At the midpoint of the N.B.A. season, Kyle Kuzma was daydreaming about something the Lakers have yet to unveil: a small-ball lineup with LeBron James manning the center position. The Lakers already generate the third-highest pace in the league using a traditional lineup, so imagine the possibilities.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat small-ball lineup is going to be huge for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuzma told reporters on Wednesday morning, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially in the playoffs when everybody\xe2\x80\x99s going to be going small.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kuzma, a second-year forward, was making two assumptions: first, that the Lakers would make the playoffs, and second, that they would have enough time to experiment with the lineup and refine it ahead of a hypothetical trip to the postseason. Not to stamp all over Kuzma\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, but neither of those is a guarantee given the way the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 hodgepodge season has gone.'
b'Coach Luke Walton, to his credit, is taking a more pragmatic approach. Though he entered the season hoping to unleash a smaller lineup that could cause mismatch problems, the Lakers do not have time to mess around with experiments, he said, not right now, not after their recent struggles, not with their continuing rash of injuries and absences.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to get tougher to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cAs the season gets further and further down the road, those, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, let\xe2\x80\x99s try this during the game\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be less and less because we\xe2\x80\x99re in a pretty nasty fight for who gets in and who\xe2\x80\x99s not in. So it will be more about what we\xe2\x80\x99re good at, and try to get better and better at that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Every team copes with injuries of varying magnitudes, and the Lakers have dealt with their share. On Wednesday night, LeBron James \xe2\x80\x94 no longer indestructible, apparently \xe2\x80\x94 missed his eighth consecutive game with a strained left groin, but he looked upbeat on the home bench at Staples Center during his team\xe2\x80\x99s 113-100 victory against the Detroit Pistons.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought our team showed a lot of growth from, however you want to call it, the post-LeBron injury,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walton, whose team improved to 23-19.'
b'An important caveat: The Pistons, who have lost 15 of their last 19 games, are not playing stellar basketball. But the LeBron-free Lakers are beginning to look more cohesive and more confident than they did in the days after they lost him to his injury on Dec. 25. They have won two straight, with James\xe2\x80\x99s return date still uncertain.'
b'After the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 medical staff evaluated James on Thursday, the team announced in a statement that he was progressing and had been cleared \xe2\x80\x9cto increase on-court functional basketball movements.\xe2\x80\x9d He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next Wednesday, but in the meantime the Lakers will play on without him, starting Friday against the Utah Jazz.'
b'James\xe2\x80\x99s absence \xe2\x80\x94 however long it lasts \xe2\x80\x94 may not wind up being the worst thing for the Lakers. His workload over the past decade-plus has been immense, with most of his seasons extending through the N.B.A. finals. He just turned 34. Assuming he returns at full strength, without complications, James could probably benefit from a midseason break.'
b'More important, perhaps, has been the opportunity for the team\xe2\x80\x99s lesser lights to operate on their own. The training wheels are off. For a while, it looked bleak. The Lakers lost five of their first six games without James, and it got bad enough that Kobe Bryant logged on to Twitter to defend Walton from an angry mob.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cRelax,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant, one the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s most iconic figures, wrote in a post on his account. \xe2\x80\x9cEntire squad is damn near out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At the time, the Lakers were without James, Kuzma and Rajon Rondo. Rondo could miss another two to three weeks after undergoing surgery on his right hand (for the second time this season), but Kuzma, who was sidelined for two games with a back contusion, has since returned.'
b'On Monday, with the rust from his injury still apparent, Kuzma shot 4 of 20 from the field in a win against the Dallas Mavericks. On Tuesday, an off day for the Lakers, he went to the practice facility and took 500 shots, Walton said. On Wednesday, Kuzma scored a career-high 41 points in 29 minutes while shooting 16 of 24 from the field.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would have told me two years ago, when I was in college, that I would score 40 for the Lakers, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed you,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuzma said. \xe2\x80\x9cKind of crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But this is his reality at age 23, and Walton said he was also pleased with the aggressive play of Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, who are both 21. They are learning as they go, and their curriculum has been more advanced in recent days.'
b'At the same time, the Lakers have emerged as a surprisingly respectable defensive team. Entering Thursday, they ranked eighth in the league in overall defensive rating.'
b'Asked what he knew about his team at this stage of the season, Walton said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that when we\xe2\x80\x99re at our best, we\xe2\x80\x99re a really good team. We know that we\xe2\x80\x99re a team that can hang our hat on playing defense and getting stops. We\xe2\x80\x99re good when we get out and run. LeBron James is really good.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But really, Walton said, there are probably more unknowns than knowns with this group. On only a handful of occasions has he had close to a full roster at his disposal. The rest of the league will be interested to see what the Lakers look like when he finally does.'

b'DENVER \xe2\x80\x94 Moments after the Golden State Warriors finished obliterating the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday night, Draymond Green was asked about a teammate who did not even play \xe2\x80\x94 a teammate, in fact, who has yet to log a single minute this season but is nearing his much-anticipated debut.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully,\xe2\x80\x9d Green said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s devastating for everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Let that soak in for a second. The Warriors, who have won three of the last four N.B.A. championships, are already good at basketball. All they did on Tuesday was set an N.B.A. record by scoring 51 points in the first quarter \xe2\x80\x94 the first quarter! \xe2\x80\x94 against a team that came into the game with the best record in the Western Conference.'
b'But now, after signing DeMarcus Cousins over the summer and spending recent months incorporating him into their dynastic fold as he recovered from Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon surgery, the Warriors expect him to be in their starting lineup when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. It is a grand experiment that will play out over the second half of the season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMore than anything, we\xe2\x80\x99re just excited for DeMarcus,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Steve Kerr said late Tuesday night, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to take him some time to get his rhythm.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Cousins, a 28-year-old center and a four-time All-Star, has not played since Jan. 26, 2018, when he tore his left Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 in a game for the New Orleans Pelicans. At the time, Cousins was having a career season, with averages of 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists a game. He was also due for free agency and an enormous payday.'
b'But his type of injury has ended careers, particularly among big men, and every team in the league balked at offering him a long-term deal. He wound up with the Warriors, who signed him to a one-year contract worth $5.3 million \xe2\x80\x94 a modest price for a reclamation project with upside and little obvious risk.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Cousins told reporters last week. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs, but the finish line is ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'There is no way of knowing if Cousins, who is listed at 6-feet-11 and 270 pounds, will ever be the top-tier player he once was. But the Warriors neither need nor expect him to be a focal point of their offense, and if he merely commands attention from defenders, especially in the post, he should free up additional space on the perimeter for the team\xe2\x80\x99s cavalcade of shooters.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a player like him before, so it will be new,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be a simple \xe2\x80\x98plug him in and he\xe2\x80\x99ll fit right in.\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99ll play through him some, so there will be a period where we have to adapt. Fortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99re halfway through the year. We have a lot of games to figure this out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Since the Warriors began collecting championships under Kerr in 2015, they have had a rotating cast of dependable but unspectacular centers: Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, Zaza Pachulia, JaVale McGee. Cousins has never been a role player, though he acknowledged his new (and unfamiliar) place in the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 ecosystem.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be taking as many shots as I have in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He also has a reputation for being emotional, and something of an antagonist. Some of the Warriors have firsthand experience. Kerr recalled getting ejected after arguing with the officials in a game against the Sacramento Kings in 2017, back when Cousins was playing for them. But before he left the court, Kerr caught Cousins taunting him by waving goodbye.'
b'Then there was an episode last season, when Cousins was playing for the Pelicans, and he got into an altercation with Kevin Durant. After both players were ejected, Cousins tried to track down Durant outside the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 locker room \xe2\x80\x94 and not to exchange pleasantries.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows that you care,\xe2\x80\x9d Cousins said of playing with passion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows that it means something to you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really fans of the guys who are emotionless on the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Nuggets Coach Mike Malone, who briefly coached Cousins in Sacramento, said he enjoyed the experience.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI loved coaching him,\xe2\x80\x9d Malone said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s a player that\xe2\x80\x99s misunderstood, and when you have a chance to know him, you realize who he is as a player and as a person. And when he\xe2\x80\x99s healthy, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the more unstoppable big men in the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Malone compared Cousins to Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets\xe2\x80\x99 fourth-year center and an emerging multidimensional force.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe can score inside, and he can score outside,\xe2\x80\x9d Malone said of Cousins. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can handle the ball, and he can make his teammates better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Malone said he expected that Cousins would give the Warriors \xe2\x80\x9ca big lift,\xe2\x80\x9d and Malone made those remarks before the Nuggets\xe2\x80\x99 142-111 loss to the Warriors.'
b'The Warriors have had their struggles this season, although these things tend to be relative. Green beefed with Durant. Stephen Curry missed 11 games with a strained groin. Klay Thompson labored through an early-season shooting slump that he refused to acknowledge as an early-season shooting slump. And they have lost more games than they usually do.'
b'The Warriors have been rolling of late, though, winning seven of their last eight before their game against the Pelicans on Wednesday night. They appear to be playing their best basketball of the season, as evidenced by their demolition of the Nuggets, a rout so thorough that Malone said it would be impossible for his team to just \xe2\x80\x9cflush\xe2\x80\x9d the loss and forget it.'
b'But now, as the Warriors get ready to introduce Cousins to their explosive mix, there are questions: Can he play with pace? Can he acclimate himself to a supporting role? Can he defend quicker players if opponents go small against him? And most important, can he stay healthy and find his old form ahead of the playoffs?'
b'The Warriors are eager to find out.'

b'CHARLOTTE, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 After two weeks of Anthony Davis\xe2\x80\x99s trade request dominating conversation around the N.B.A., Commissioner Adam Silver on Saturday sounded sanguine about any possible negative effects it was having on the league.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the greatest players in the history of this league have demanded trades at various points of their contracts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at his annual All-Star weekend address. He went on to say that there was \xe2\x80\x9cvery little\xe2\x80\x9d he could do to completely stop players from trying to force trades.'
b'Davis was fined $50,000 for the public trade request made by his agent, Rich Paul. Silver said it was healthy for players and their agents to have ongoing conversations with their teams about future intentions, but that he preferred that such conversations happen behind closed doors. As for the frenzy of news media attention surrounding Davis and his possible destination this summer, Silver said the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic spectacle\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the type of media interest the league wanted.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly are becoming a 52-week-a-year sport, and it\xe2\x80\x99s largely the result of tremendous interest in these players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we could do a better job as a league in avoiding those situations where they get to the point where players are maybe demanding they be traded or, worst-case scenario, saying, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to honor my contract.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'[Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo\xe2\x80\x99s Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame]'
b'Silver has frequently stated a desire to improve the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s competitive balance. Asked whether small-market teams could compete with large-market franchises, Silver largely disputed the premise without even citing the fact that the Milwaukee Bucks, a small-market club, currently have the best winning percentage in the league.'
b'He took the opposite approach.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure where the line is anymore on big markets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls \xe2\x80\x94 teams that play in major cities \xe2\x80\x94 have struggled on the court in recent years.'
b'Silver also said it was too early to judge whether reforms to the draft lottery, intended to reduce the incentive to tank in pursuit of a high draft pick, were having the intended effect. Four teams this year are on pace to win fewer than 20 games, but Silver said there is also an unusually large number still in contention for a playoff berth.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI personally don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is a winning strategy over the long term, losing for multiple years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silver. He also said that choosing to be uncompetitive for an extended period of time would most likely have a \xe2\x80\x9ccorrosive\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 effect on any team that took that approach.'
b'Taken together, Silver\xe2\x80\x99s responses to questions suggested that he was relatively happy with the state of the N.B.A. and believed that the league\xe2\x80\x99s problems could be solved through tweaks to the system, not wholesale changes.'
b'Silver opened the news conference by addressing House Bill 2, the law passed in North Carolina in 2016 that invalidated local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and required people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that corresponded with the genders listed on their birth certificates. In response to the law, the N.B.A. took the All-Star Game, originally scheduled to be played in Charlotte in 2017, away from the city.'
b'He said it was the view of the league office that the law discriminated against the LGBTQ community, and subsequently the N.B.A. made the decision that it was \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d The N.B.A. decided to return after the law was partially repealed.'
b'Asked about efforts to improve the culture of the Dallas Mavericks, where a league investigation found numerous instances of sexual harassment and improper conduct among employees, Silver offered few specifics but said there was a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete sea change in culture on the business side\xe2\x80\x9d of the organization.'
b'Earlier Saturday, the N.B.A., in partnership with the International Basketball Federation, announced the formation of the Basketball Africa League, a 12-team professional league made up of clubs from across Africa. The league will begin play in 2020, the first time that the N.B.A. will be involved in the operation of a league outside of North America.'
b'Many details, including which clubs from which countries will be part of the league, have yet to be finalized, but Silver did say that former President Barack Obama would be involved in the league in an unspecified capacity.'

b'Andrew Bogut made his return to the N.B.A. on Wednesday, signing a rest-of-the-season contract to rejoin the Golden State Warriors. The reunion came two years to the day since Bogut, the former No. 1 overall selection in the 2005 draft, sustained a gruesome leg injury.'
b'Bogut, 34, spent this season starring for the Sydney Kings in his native Australia and, by his own admission, was convinced \xe2\x80\x9cthat the N.B.A. door had shut.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But the Warriors began lobbying Bogut to rejoin them in December and made it to March with a roster opening for the 7-foot center, who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available to be signed until the Kings\xe2\x80\x99 season ended last weekend.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was kind of blown away,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogut said in a telephone interview from Australia. \xe2\x80\x9cThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a situation where I threw my hat in the ring to try to get signed in the N.B.A. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo come back to the N.B.A., for me, was basically Golden State or nothing. But the fact it was Golden State \xe2\x80\x94 it was the kind of opportunity that I would be kicking myself if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Bogut signed a two-year deal with Sydney last April, he described it as \xe2\x80\x9cmy official retirement from the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x9d He proceeded to win Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year honors in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s National Basketball League, averaging 11.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.7 blocks per game.'
b'Bogut\xe2\x80\x99s contract with Sydney does not contain an N.B.A. release clause, but he told the Warriors that he would entertain the prospect of rejoining them on a short-term basis after the Australian season \xe2\x80\x94 as long as Sydney officials blessed it \xe2\x80\x94 should Golden State still have a need.'
b'Had the Warriors succeeded in landing a recent free agent from the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbuyout\xe2\x80\x9d market \xe2\x80\x94 such as the swingman Wesley Matthews, who opted to sign with Indiana after securing his release from the Knicks \xe2\x80\x94 they would have had no roster room for Bogut.'
b'But once it became clear that the Chicago Bulls would refuse to release the veteran center Robin Lopez before March 1, thus missing deadline for Lopez to retain his playoff eligibility with a new team, Golden State intensified its pursuit of Bogut as soon as the Kings were eliminated from the N.B.L. playoffs.'
b'As the Warriors continue to try to assimilate the former All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins into their rotation, Bogut said he had \xe2\x80\x9cno illusions\xe2\x80\x9d about the fact that \xe2\x80\x9csome games I\xe2\x80\x99ll play and some games I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d But Bogut insisted he was \xe2\x80\x9chappy to be a positive influence on that bench\xe2\x80\x9d no matter how much he plays.'
b'The Warriors assistant general manager Larry Harris, who was Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s general manager in 2005 when the Bucks selected Bogut with the top pick in the draft, made a recent scouting trip to Australia to assess the state of Bogut\xe2\x80\x99s game firsthand and convey the seriousness of Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s interest.'
b'Warriors Coach Steve Kerr referred to Bogut as \xe2\x80\x9can insurance policy in the frontcourt.\xe2\x80\x9d But Bogut\xe2\x80\x99s defensive know-how and his familiarity with the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 star trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the league\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitive championship favorites in the quest to improve on their woeful standing of 16th in defensive efficiency (109.5 points allowed per 100 possessions.)'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee this happening but I\xe2\x80\x99m excited as hell about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Green told Bay Area reporters. He and Bogut quickly meshed as co-anchors of a vaunted Golden State defense in 2014-15, when the Warriors began their five-season run of dominance.'
b'After the Warriors won a league-record 73 games in 2015-16 but blew a 3-1 lead to the LeBron James-led Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals, Bogut and the veteran forward Harrison Barnes were quickly jettisoned to Dallas to create the requisite salary-cap space for Golden State to sign Kevin Durant.'
b'Bogut, though, said that returning to the Warriors nearly three years later to play alongside Durant would not \xe2\x80\x9cbe weird\xe2\x80\x9d despite the contentious nature of his departure.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden State Warriors are a very special organization in my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogut said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a lot of great years there and won a championship. Even though they moved me, it was understandable to get a guy like Kevin Durant. I probably would have traded myself if I had the same opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was Bogut\xe2\x80\x99s longtime agent, David Bauman of Independent Sports and Entertainment, who first pointed out to him that Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s signing with the Warriors coincided with the two-year anniversary of the fractured tibia in his left leg that Bogut sustained 56 seconds into his Cleveland Cavaliers debut in March 2017.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just funny how the world works sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogut said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an unbelievable opportunity that I\xe2\x80\x99m really thankful for.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'For basketball reporters, April means it\xe2\x80\x99s time to kiss the family goodbye and set off on the year\xe2\x80\x99s most thrilling \xe2\x80\x94 and exhausting \xe2\x80\x94 reporting trail.'
b'By Harvey Araton'
b'Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.'
b'The N.B.A. playoffs begin this weekend, which for those who report regularly on the world\xe2\x80\x99s premier professional basketball league means one thing: the temporary suspension of life as they know it.'
b'If it\xe2\x80\x99s April, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to tie up loose ends at home, kiss the significant other or beloved cat goodbye and wish the kids well on the soccer pitch. Someone please remember to send Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day flowers. Father\xe2\x80\x99s Day will be celebrated pending the length of the finals.'
b'The reporting grind of the 82-game regular season is disruptively hectic enough. But during the postseason, the sport sheds its least watchable teams, as well as a few that are competitively marginal, and gets down to the games that conclusively matter.'
b'Breakout performances will become instant classics. Acknowledged stars could transition into legends with championship rings. Nothing may be missed in the postseason business of media-driven mythmaking.'
b'Will Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors win a fourth ring in June, bringing him within two of Michael Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\xe2\x80\x99s half-dozen each (though still far behind Bill Russell\xe2\x80\x99s 11)? Or will destiny call upon a first-timer like the so-called Greek Freak, Giannis Antetokounmpo of the rising Milwaukee Bucks?'
b'As a sports reporter and columnist for four decades, the last 25 years of which were with The Times, the playoffs habitually meant two months of missing the springtime sun and \xe2\x80\x94 by the early 1990s \xe2\x80\x94 my two young sons, while chasing the extended N.B.A. family of one-name luminaries. (You know who I mean: Magic, Larry, Michael, LeBron.)'
b'Throughout the playoffs, reporters must confront the crush of late-night deadlines while nattily dressed superstars complicate filing by taking their sweet time getting to the interview podium. Hours later, it\xe2\x80\x99s on to the next city, the next round, often dealing with the logistical conundrum of never being sure when one series will end and the next will begin.'
b'For a portion of my years on the basketball beat, that meant attaching myself to the Knicks, who children of a certain age might have a hard time believing consistently qualified for the playoffs. That was way back in the 1990s, otherwise known around New York as the Patrick Ewing Era.'
b'When Ewing\xe2\x80\x99s Knicks were ousted, it was on to chronicle Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls as they accumulated six titles in eight years, disbanding in 1998 and ceding short-term control of the sport to the Los Angeles Lakers of Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal and Kobe Bryant. And so it went, into a new century that spawned even greater global exposure and scrutiny of a virtual one-man industry, LeBron James Inc.'
b'For those having slept through the last six months, James will not be appearing in the 2019 playoffs after a gargantuan run of reaching the league championship series for eight straight years. His migration to Hollywood from Cleveland produced a critically assailed version of Lakers Showtime that, had he not signed a four-year contract last summer, would have already been canceled. (The Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 hope of attracting a worthy co-star is as yet unrealized.)'
b'Hence, the fortunes of the soon-to-be free agents Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and others will be fascinating spring subplots. No reporters worth their credentials will risk blinking through a telltale expression or a body-language betrayal of otherwise guarded intentions.'
b'The playoffs, while typically impassioned and illuminating, are also logistically exhausting, but I confidently speak for my N.B.A. media brethren when I say that covering them is far more privilege than punishment.'
b'The game looks much different now \xe2\x80\x94 so much of it focused on 3-point shooting \xe2\x80\x94 than it did during my earliest years on the N.B.A. beat. Back then, I routinely insisted there was no place in the world I would rather be than the old, ventilation-challenged Boston Garden for a showdown between the Celtics and Lakers. The modern and far more international N.B.A. media no doubt is equally passionate.'
b'But lives do change. Issues arise. We in the ever-more-distant press-row seats do not attend games with traditional partisan interests, but over the long playoff haul, personal circumstances and needs do create some dilemmas.'
b'Consider my plight in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 1993 finals between Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s Bulls and Charles Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s Phoenix Suns. The Bulls were leading in the series three games to two, but were trailing by 2 points while trying to avoid playing a seventh game in a hostile road arena.'
b'Back home in Brooklyn, my wife was seven months pregnant with our second child while simultaneously preparing to sell our co-op and buy a house in New Jersey. Had the Bulls lost Game 6, I would not have made it home until the night before both closings and the move.'
b'Fortunately for me, if not the Suns, all five Bulls touched the ball on a play that produced a historically clutch 3-point shot by John Paxson. The Bulls\xe2\x80\x99 bid for a third straight title survived, along with my marriage.'

b'With all of the trade drama surrounding Anthony Davis and Kristaps Porzingis, the N.B.A. intruded on the N.F.L.\xe2\x80\x99s run-up to the Super Bowl as we have not seen since Kobe Bryant scored 81 points on football\xe2\x80\x99s so-called Championship Sunday in 2006.'
b'Now that the Super Bowl is over and even more of North America\xe2\x80\x99s sporting consciousness is there to be seized by professional basketball\xe2\x80\x99s tireless headline-makers, here is our best advice: Buckle up.'
b'What follows is a by-the-numbers look at what the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s 73rd season has served up so far \xe2\x80\x94 and what the next five months hold.'
b'Through Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s games, only the Milwaukee Bucks were on a 60-win pace. The Bucks\xe2\x80\x99 Eastern Conference-leading record of 38-13 projects to a 61-win campaign \xe2\x80\x94 which could keep this season from being the league\xe2\x80\x99s first since 2000-1 without a 60-win club.'
b'There are realistically 11 teams battling for the Western Conference\xe2\x80\x99s eight playoff spots, after the new calendar year began with 14 teams in the conference \xe2\x80\x94 all but Phoenix \xe2\x80\x94 in the race. Dallas, New Orleans and Memphis have dropped off in January, prompting all three teams to focus more on trades than the standings.'
b'The consensus top three in the Most Valuable Player Award race coming out of Super Bowl weekend are Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston\xe2\x80\x99s James Harden and Denver\xe2\x80\x99s Nikola Jokic. According to the Basketball-Reference.com M.V.P. Award Tracker, Antetokounmpo awoke Sunday with a 37.8 percent chance of winning \xe2\x80\x94 far ahead of Harden\xe2\x80\x99s 21.1 percent.'
b'Harden has scored at least 30 points in 26 consecutive games, good for the third-longest such streak in N.B.A. annals behind Wilt Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s streaks of 65 and 31.'
b'The league\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern) is three days away. This is the second season since 1978-79 (as far back as reliable N.B.A. record-keeping goes) that the deadline falls before the All-Star Game.'
b'The New Orleans Pelicans have made two trips to the playoffs \xe2\x80\x94 winning only one series \xe2\x80\x94 in Davis\xe2\x80\x99s first six seasons with the team. Davis requested a trade on Jan. 28.'
b'It took 54 days for the Minnesota Timberwolves to find a trade they liked for Jimmy Butler after Butler\xe2\x80\x99s request to be dealt became public Sept. 18. Butler was snubbed by East coaches in All-Star voting, but the potential ceiling for Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s rugged new star threesome was evident Thursday night at Golden State, when Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Butler and Company brought a halt to the longest winning streak of the season \xe2\x80\x94 after the Warriors had won 11 in a row.'
b'Minnesota is 21-18 since the trade that sent Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 \xe2\x80\x94 and 6-6 since firing Tom Thibodeau, the coach/team president who made it, on Jan. 6. Ryan Saunders, Thibodeau\xe2\x80\x99s 32-year-old replacement, has many admirers around the league, but the Wolves are a long way from convincing skeptics that the deal (to bring in Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick) was sufficient for a player of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s caliber.'
b'Thibodeau is one of three coaches to be fired this season \xe2\x80\x94 after nine coaching changes in the off-season. The other coaches to lose their jobs since opening night: Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s Tyronn Lue and Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Fred Hoiberg.'
b'There were 20 teams, entering Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s play, attempting at least 30 3-pointers a game. This is poised to become the first season in N.B.A. history that the leaguewide average per game (31.4) will finish in the 30s.'
b'With coaches calling for more 3-pointers than ever before and greenlighting shots earlier and earlier in the 24-second shot clock \xe2\x80\x94 along with a new rule that resets the shot clock at 14 seconds on offensive rebounds \xe2\x80\x94 teams are averaging 100.0 possessions per 48 minutes leaguewide. The last N.B.A. season in which that figure finished in triple digits was 1988-89 (100.6).'
b'Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s Khris Middleton, Orlando\xe2\x80\x99s Nikola Vucevic, Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s Simmons and Denver\xe2\x80\x99s Jokic will make their All-Star Game debuts Feb. 17 in Charlotte, N.C. The All-Star player draft, in which the captains LeBron James and Antetokounmpo will fill out 13-man rosters by picking players playground-style, is Thursday at 7 p.m. \xe2\x80\x94 just four hours after the trade deadline passes. (D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo Russell of the Nets, who was named later as a replacement for Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s Victor Oladipo, who is injured, will also be making his All-Star debut this year.)'
b'Four teams are in contention for the league\xe2\x80\x99s worst record: Phoenix (11-43), Cleveland (11-42), Chicago (12-41) and, of course, the Knicks (10-42). The teams that finish in the bottom three will share a 14 percent chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in June in the first year of the league\xe2\x80\x99s revised lottery system.'
b'San Antonio sits a surprising fifth in the West, at 32-22, in its first season since trading Kawhi Leonard to Toronto in July. The Spurs are bidding for a record 22nd consecutive playoff berth, a streak that began in Gregg Popovich\xe2\x80\x99s first full season as Spurs coach in 1997-98.'
b'At 27-25, Sacramento is on course to post its first winning record since the 2005-6 season. But the Kings will have to leapfrog at least two teams to stop the league\xe2\x80\x99s longest playoff drought (12 seasons). The Suns (nine seasons) and the Orlando Magic (seven) are on course to extend their own playoff droughts.'
b'The Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 playoff drought will hit a hard-to-believe six seasons in a row if James cannot save Los Angeles over its final 29 games. James just missed 17 consecutive games with a strained groin \xe2\x80\x94 the longest injury absence of his pro career \xe2\x80\x94 and is at risk for missing the postseason for the first time since his second N.B.A. season, in 2004-5.'
b'Carmelo Anthony finally became an unrestricted free agent on Sunday after clearing waivers nearly three months after the Houston Rockets sent him away in November after just 10 games together. The Rockets traded Anthony to Chicago on Jan. 21; the Bulls, who needed a roster spot, waived him Friday without him spending a single second with the team.'
b'In the seven games Golden State has deployed a lineup of DeMarcus Cousins, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, that group is averaging 127.1 points per 100 possessions in 54 minutes. Call it a small but ominous sample size.'
b'Oddsmakers in Las Vegas have the Warriors as overwhelming favorites to win their third consecutive championship and fourth in five seasons. According to ActionNetwork.com, Golden State is -225 to win it all, meaning that you would have to bet $225 to win $100. Boston, Milwaukee and Toronto are next in line at +1,000, meaning that a $100 bet would win $1,000 if any of those teams won the title.'
b'One scribe\xe2\x80\x99s ranking of the top 10 players who could be unrestricted free agents July 1: Durant, Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Thompson, Butler, Kemba Walker, Cousins, Middleton, Marc Gasol and Tobias Harris.'
b'The N.B.A. playoffs start April 13.'

b'The Mavericks rookie is drawing LeBron James comparisons and has \xe2\x80\x9cfast-forwarded\xe2\x80\x9d his team\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making.'
b'By Marc Stein'
b'DALLAS \xe2\x80\x94 Dirk Nowitzki has seen many things in his 21 seasons with the Dallas Mavericks. What he had never seen, until last month, was a fellow Maverick who could attract nearly two dozen autograph seekers in subzero temperatures to greet the team bus on a Thursday morning in Detroit.'
b'Luka Doncic did just that in the 2 a.m. hour of Jan. 31, as the Mavericks pulled into a hotel adjacent to the world headquarters of General Motors, on the unglamorous end of a back-to-back set that began in New York.'
b'It is likewise safe to presume that none of Nowitzki\xe2\x80\x99s other 197 teammates over two decades in Dallas could have inspired what happened mere hours later. In a swift-moving blockbuster trade, Dallas acquired Kristaps Porzingis from the Knicks to serve as Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s sidekick, with Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson openly admitting that he pushed for the deal because Doncic has \xe2\x80\x9cfast-forwarded a lot of our decision-making.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'These are the tales from just one day, albeit maybe the wildest day, of what Nowitzki frequently refers to as Lukamania.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get to cities now, even late at night, there are so many people waiting with things for him to sign that it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like we\xe2\x80\x99re the Warriors,\xe2\x80\x9d Nowitzki said. \xe2\x80\x9cLukamania is real. We\xe2\x80\x99re living it every day.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'[Another Rookie: The Perimeter Can\xe2\x80\x99t Protect You From Mitchell Robinson]'
b'This week brings another milestone for Doncic, who celebrates his 20th birthday on Thursday. He is averaging 20.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists through 56 games and is responsible for four of the five triple-doubles in N.B.A. history recorded by teenagers. It is a start that has quickly validated Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s long-held belief that Doncic possessed superstar potential.'
b'The only other rookie in league history to hit those levels over a full season was Oscar Robertson in 1960-61.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love, love, love guys that can pass the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Nelson said, prioritizing Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s ability to run a team at 6 feet 7 inches over the fact he is already known for having the league\xe2\x80\x99s second-most-feared step-back jump shot, behind only James Harden\xe2\x80\x99s.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I could play over here,\xe2\x80\x9d Doncic said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s better than I expected, for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The gaudy numbers and worldwide interest in his exploits enabled Doncic to amass more than four million votes in N.B.A. All-Star balloting, trailing only LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Doncic, in other words, finished higher in leaguewide balloting than Michael Jordan (fifth) did as a rookie. Higher, too, than James (13th) and even Yao Ming, who could manage only the fourth-highest total in 2003 despite the considerable voting might of Yao\xe2\x80\x99s native China.'
b'Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s instant production has also validated every pundit who insisted, amid no shortage of skepticism, that concerns about Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s athleticism and corresponding ability to deal with the length of N.B.A. defenders were folly given the rampant success he achieved both at the club (Real Madrid) and national team (Slovenia) levels as an 18-year-old. In the process, Doncic has unleashed a torrent of second-guessing upon the teams (Phoenix, Sacramento and Atlanta) that let him slip to the Mavericks. '
b'Yet Doncic insists his maiden N.B.A. season, which appears destined to be christened with the league\xe2\x80\x99s rookie of the year trophy, has not been as easy it looks.'
b'The Mavericks, you see, were 26-34 entering Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s home date with Indiana and likely to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive season. They have traded away all four of Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s projected fellow starters (Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wes Matthews and Harrison Barnes) in deals that netted Porzingis and roughly $30 million in salary-cap space, neither of which can help the team this season.'
b'It is the first time in Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s life, since he took up basketball at age 7, that he has experienced losing. One hint of how well he\xe2\x80\x99s coping with it: Doncic has pulled his jersey apart in frustration after a play gone awry \xe2\x80\x94 twice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s harder than people think,\xe2\x80\x9d Doncic said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a winner \xe2\x80\x94 he won everything in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Juancho Hernangomez of the Denver Nuggets said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo every time he loses, he gets so mad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hernangomez has been observing Doncic from close range for years, both on the floor \xe2\x80\x94 since Doncic played alongside Hernangomez\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s Willy Hernangomez, at Real Madrid \xe2\x80\x94 and through their shared WhatsApp chat room, which houses various European players fond of the popular video game Fortnite. But Mavericks officials are not worried about a scouting report from a friend that paints Doncic as a sore loser.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t handle losing well \xe2\x80\x94 I know that for a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Dallas Coach Rick Carlisle said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t handle losing well, either.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As recently as May 15, Mavericks executives were worried about Doncic \xe2\x80\x94 big time. Having known for more than a year that they wanted to draft him if they had the chance, team officials were crestfallen in Chicago when Dallas slipped from a projected No. 3 in that night\xe2\x80\x99s draft lottery to No. 5. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was devastating for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Nelson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought our chance to get him was gone because it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to trade up in the lottery.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Nowitzki betrayed a public hint of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment when he tweeted this reaction: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To move up high enough, Dallas ultimately had to persuade the Atlanta Hawks to surrender the No. 3 overall pick. It cost Dallas both the No. 5 pick, which Atlanta used to take Trae Young, as well as the Mavericks\xe2\x80\x99 top pick in the 2019 draft. '
b'But the Dallas owner, Mark Cuban, blessed the deal, even at that price, because Nelson lobbied so hard for it. Five years earlier, during the 2013 draft, Nelson and his longtime international scout, Tony Ronzone, pushed for the Mavericks to use the No. 13 pick on a little-known Greek teenager named Giannis Antetokounmpo. Cuban wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow it, given that Antetokounmpo, unlike Doncic, was mostly a mystery \xe2\x80\x94 and promptly regretted it as Antetokounmpo blossomed into a star in Milwaukee.'
b'So this time, after the disappointment of the lottery, Cuban blessed Nelson to do whatever it took to land Doncic. What the team got was the son of a former Slovene pro \xe2\x80\x94 Sasa Doncic \xe2\x80\x94 and a veteran of three full seasons in the EuroLeague and Spain\xe2\x80\x99s La Liga with Real Madrid after Luka Doncic made his pro debut at 16.'
b'To the Mavericks\xe2\x80\x99 delight, Doncic was more N.B.A.-ready than they ever dreamed \xe2\x80\x94 as his 16-for-29 shooting in the final three minutes of one-possession games this season would suggest. As Carlisle put it: \xe2\x80\x9cUnique background, unique skill set, unique body type.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hesitate to throw out names like LeBron James and Magic Johnson, who have been do-everything kind of stars, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear now that Luka has many of those same traits and has proven that he can do a lot of those things,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlisle said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has deceptive size, strength and quickness \xe2\x80\x94 and an understanding beyond his years on how to use his body to make plays and draw fouls.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Carlisle is hardly alone in making such lofty comparisons. Miami\xe2\x80\x99s Dwyane Wade, one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s foremost James experts after their four seasons together with the Heat, has called Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s passing \xe2\x80\x9cLeBron-like.\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Los Angeles Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said of Doncic: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite player to watch almost, and not talking just rookies. First of all, he plays with a great joy \xe2\x80\x94 I love that. And he\xe2\x80\x99s just so advanced in the way he plays. The sky\xe2\x80\x99s the limit for him. Wait until he gets in shape.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Rivers was laughing when he tacked on that last line, but he did hit on a prime area of Year 1 concern with Doncic \xe2\x80\x94 conditioning.'
b'The Mavericks and Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s representatives, headed by the longtime N.B.A. agent Bill Duffy, agreed shortly after the draft to impose as much rest on Doncic as possible from July through September after a nonstop run at the highest levels of international basketball for nearly a year. Doncic thus began the season heavier than his listed weight of 218 and has absorbed jibes about his diet ever since.'
b'But Mavericks officials are pleased with the gradual changes in Doncic\xe2\x80\x99s dietary habits. At the team\xe2\x80\x99s behest, Doncic hired a chef in December to prepare a number of meals for pregame and off-night consumption. Doncic has also begun working fresh juices into his routine.'
b'In Madrid, Doncic lived for the past two and a half years with his mother, Mirjam Poterbin, who raised Doncic while running two beauty salons in Ljubljana. (Doncic has long declined to discuss his father.)'
b'In Dallas, mom and son live separately near the American Airlines Center as Doncic grows into his independence, but still within walking distance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was his dream,\xe2\x80\x9d Poterbin said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt 7 years old he was already talking about N.B.A. I cry a lot of times.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Yet there have been Year 1 challenges and disappointments for Doncic amid the Lukamania \xe2\x80\x94 and beyond the ever-present adjustment to playing for a team with scant postseason prospects.'
b'He watched helplessly as his fellow Spanish-speaking teammate J.J. Barea suffered a season-ending Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tear in January. He lived through his first big trade, seeing Dallas abruptly abort its planned Doncic/Smith Jr. partnership when the chance arose to acquire his pal Porzingis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked,\xe2\x80\x9d Doncic said. \xe2\x80\x9cEurope doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work like this.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Doncic has also struggled at times with his free throws, converting just 72.6 percent this season despite proving so adept at getting to the line (6.4 times per game). Mom, meanwhile, admitted that Doncic was \xe2\x80\x9cquite sad at first\xe2\x80\x9d about missing out on an All-Star spot because of a format change in which fan balloting, as of last season, only accounts for 50 percent of the equation for determining starters.'
b'The good news: These all rank as welcome tests \xe2\x80\x94 even the Mavericks\xe2\x80\x99 sub-.500 record \xe2\x80\x94 compared to the early hurdles posed by the transition Doncic faced at 13. That was his tender age when Doncic left his mother back in Slovenia to enter the Real Madrid academy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no words to describe this, really,\xe2\x80\x9d Poterbin said. \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly I would not go through it again.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was way harder,\xe2\x80\x9d Doncic said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan coming from Madrid to here.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'In a rookie season that has resembled a seismograph, Knicks forward Kevin Knox needed a performance like Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s against the Los Angeles Lakers. He scored 19 points with an array of shots, slashing to the basket, hitting a step-back 3-pointer while guarded by LeBron James and finishing with finesse on a driving, left-handed layup.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Kevin Knox. It was good to see him play well,\xe2\x80\x9d Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had his bumps. We know it\xe2\x80\x99s there, it\xe2\x80\x99s in there. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of the ball going in and him getting his confidence up. But I really thought he came with a mind-set that he was going to get out of this rut. The way he was attacking, the force he was playing with.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Knox shot 8 of 14 from the field and 3 of 5 from 3-point range in the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 124-123 victory over the Lakers, their 14th win in a dismal season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d been struggling a little bit, but the whole team and coaching staff had confidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d Knox said. \xe2\x80\x9cI came to work every single day, got up extra shots. I knew I was going to come out of the streak, so I just wanted to make sure I kept shooting.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Last year the Knicks selected Knox, a freshman from Kentucky, in the first round of the draft, ninth over all. After an ankle sprain sidelined him at the start of the season, Knox\xe2\x80\x99s play took off in December, when he averaged 17.1 points and was named the Eastern Conference rookie of the month.'
b'Knox, 19, hit the rookie wall beginning in mid-January, with a 20-game stretch in which he shot 31.8 percent from the field and 27.7 from beyond the 3-point arc. The slump started soon after he scored 31 points, his highest total in the N.B.A., during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers.'
b'Shortly before that, Knox had said that he was still learning how to adjust to the demands of the long N.B.A. schedule and its 48-minute games, compared with a 40 minutes in college and A.A.U. ball.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s totally different,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in late December. \xe2\x80\x9cEight minutes doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a lot, but it really is. That\xe2\x80\x99s a whole quarter almost. Eight minutes is a long time in basketball.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'To improve his fitness, Knox did extra sprints after practice and spent more time on the treadmill, running spurts of 15 minutes with the last two as fast as he could.'
b'At various points in the season, Fizdale has brought in former Knicks greats like Bernard King, Patrick Ewing, Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier to speak to his young, struggling team. (The coach, who was a Miami Heat assistant coach when James played for them, also made a point of introducing Knox to the Lakers star after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game.)'
b'King, who was with the Knicks for five seasons in the mid-1980s, and was known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot, has focused especially on mentoring Knox.'
b'In between their meetings early in the season, Knox studied online video highlights from King\xe2\x80\x99s career.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe helps my game, every time I talk to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Knox said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like me, a wing that gets to the basket, loves transition. He kind of reminds me of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Perhaps the other way around, rook.'
b'Knox said he had sought out his own tutors as well, connecting with Chris Bosh, Grant Hill, Jalen Rose, Carmelo Anthony and former Kentucky players for bits of advice during the trying moments.'
b'After Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s 128-92 loss in Toronto, the Knicks had 11 games left in the season, all of them meaningless, except for their effect on the draft. The three teams with the lowest win totals will each have a 14 percent of landing the No. 1 selection in June, which presumably will be the Duke freshman Zion Williamson.'
b'The Knicks, who have the worst record in the league (14-57), are expected to lose their way into one of those slots, even after that uplifting win against the Lakers, which ended when the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 Mario Hezonja blocked a shot by James in the waning seconds.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a lot of ups and downs this season,\xe2\x80\x9d Knox said afterward. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was big-time win, the first sweep of the season. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a great way to win in the Garden, in the last 10 seconds, against one of the best players to ever play the game and we get a defensive stop with the crowd standing up yelling.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At a critical stretch in the fourth quarter, the Knicks had its three rookies on the court \xe2\x80\x94 Knox, center Mitchell Robinson, guard Allonzo Trier \xe2\x80\x94 plus guard Kadeem Allen, who was just called up from the Westchester developmental team, and forward Lance Thomas, the longest-tenured Knick.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a process that needs to happen, and ours is growth, making sure the young guys are getting the experience they need in order to be good in this league,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of young guys don\xe2\x80\x99t get to play especially extended minutes in their first year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a learning experience for young guys. Our goal is to fast-track them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Knox is sixth in the league among rookies in minutes played per game, at 28, despite shooting a subpar 36.4 percent from the field and struggling with weakside defense. He is averaging 12.3 points with 4.3 rebounds.'
b'Even so, Fizdale has never considered sending Knox to Westchester to work on his game in the anonymity of the G League \xe2\x80\x9cbecause our team was already like a glorified G League team,\xe2\x80\x9d Fizdale told reporters last week. Because his rookies played substantial minutes all season, he said, he thought it was better for them to take their knocks against the best.'
b'Such as James on Sunday and Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Kawhi Leonard on Monday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to the league, kid,\xe2\x80\x9d Fizdale said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what it\xe2\x80\x99s about. This is why I wanted him in this. Take those lumps now. Later on in his career, no one will remember this stuff when he is the guy beating up on kids. This is all good for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 The Los Angeles Lakers described last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s N.B.A. All-Star break as an opportunity for a much-needed reset, with the hope that they could ultimately make a playoff push after spending a few days apart. None of it sounded very convincing.'
b'But when the team reconvened for practice on Wednesday morning, LeBron James said his level of intensity had been \xe2\x80\x9cactivated,\xe2\x80\x9d as if he were a superhero who had flipped a switch. He does not usually activate himself this early in the season, he said, but the Lakers need all of him now \xe2\x80\x94 in large part because they had lost so much ground when he was sidelined for about a month with a groin injury.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe would have loved to have had success when I was out, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t, so this is where we are right now,\xe2\x80\x9d James said.'
b'And when asked how he would elevate the play of his younger teammates, he put it simply: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'In other words, it was sink or swim for the Lakers before their game against the Houston Rockets on Thursday night, and there would be no lifeguard.'
b'For one night, at least, the Lakers swam. They were cohesive enough to come away with a 111-106 victory against one of the better teams in the Western Conference. For one night, at least, the Lakers showed that they could erase a 19-point deficit by playing solid defense and making their free throws. For one night, at least, the Lakers could depend on players like Brandon Ingram (27 points, 13 rebounds) and Kyle Kuzma (18 points) to deliver in a game that the team really needed to win.'
b'The question now is whether the Lakers, who at 29-29 are the very definition of average, can build off it. Consistency has not been their hallmark.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt can give us some momentum that we need,\xe2\x80\x9d Coach Luke Walton said, \xe2\x80\x9cor it can do nothing. It depends how we respond to this.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Not so long ago, the Lakers had a similarly galvanizing win \xe2\x80\x94 or so it seemed.'
b'It was Feb. 7, and before the league\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline Magic Johnson, the team\xe2\x80\x99s president of basketball operations, had failed in his quest to ship nearly half of the roster to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for the All-Star center Anthony Davis. It was a huge soap opera, and the Lakers responded in surprising fashion: by going out that night and defeating the Boston Celtics \xe2\x80\x94 on the road, no less.'
b'The win, though, was fool\xe2\x80\x99s gold. The Lakers got pulverized by the Philadelphia 76ers three days later, then hobbled into the All-Star break with a loss to the Atlanta Hawks \xe2\x80\x94 a performance so devoid of energy that it seemed to signal a dysfunctional locker room, and maybe even one that was beyond repair.'
b'The team was below .500.'
b'Walton encouraged his players to reflect and refocus over the break. For James, that meant returning to Los Angeles in playoff mode \xe2\x80\x94 much earlier than he would prefer.'
b'But this is unfamiliar territory for James, a three-time champion who has made 13 straight trips to the playoffs and eight straight appearances in the N.B.A. finals. Now, with an inexperienced batch of teammates on the Lakers, he is merely fighting to lead them into the postseason.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all about being uncomfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said this week. \xe2\x80\x9cI love being uncomfortable. I fall in love with being uncomfortable, so this is another uncomfortable thing for me, and I love it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Then he must have loved what happened against the Rockets (33-25), who built a gaping lead in the third quarter behind James Harden. But the Lakers dominated the fourth quarter by limiting the Rockets to 36.8 percent shooting and forcing six turnovers. James finished with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had more of a serious focus on his face, about him, the last two days, even in the practice facility,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI think he recognizes where we\xe2\x80\x99re at and the sense of urgency we need to play with.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers also benefited from the fresh presence of Reggie Bullock, a versatile wing whom they acquired from the Detroit Pistons at the trade deadline. Bullock scored 14 points and defended the Rockets\xe2\x80\x99 James Harden for long stretches. For a team that lacks much experience, Bullock could make a difference moving forward.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a vet,\xe2\x80\x9d James said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to have a shooter of his caliber, of his size; his competitive nature out on the floor. He was big for us.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers left Staples Center two and a half games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final playoff spot in the West. But James expressed supreme confidence as the team prepared to visit the Pelicans on Saturday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI like where I\xe2\x80\x99m at,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will love where I\xe2\x80\x99m at in the next few games, and I believe \xe2\x80\x94 continue to get better and better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As for his teammates \xe2\x80\x94 well, that is up to them.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Rajon Rondo has had a difficult time for the Lakers. He was suspended after brawling with the Houston Rockets in the second game of the season. He proceeded to mangle his right hand not just once, but twice, requiring surgery both times while missing a total of 31 games. And in recent weeks, he has been coming off the bench for Coach Luke Walton, even as Lonzo Ball, who had been starting at point guard, continues to recover from an ankle injury.'
b'Rondo, a 13-year pro, was supposed to be an invaluable presence for the Lakers, who had otherwise surrounded LeBron James in Year 1 of the West Coast LeBron era with a cast of unproven (if promising) players and a hodgepodge of reclamation projects. Nobody thought this team would vie for a championship, but the road has been rougher than expected.'
b'In the wake of a recent two-game road trip to New Orleans and Memphis that resulted in two deflating losses and the very real sense that the Lakers could miss the playoffs, Walton approached Rondo for a quiet conversation. Walton wanted to put him back in the starting lineup for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game against the Pelicans, and Rondo was on board with the plan.'
b'After all, what did the Lakers have to lose? Aside from losing another game that they desperately needed to win.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat there and talked,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been fine with his role. He wants to play more \xe2\x80\x94 everyone wants to play more. But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been complaining or anything like that. But our conversation was one of: \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what we need to do. How do we get back on track?\xe2\x80\x99 It was an honest conversation. It was healthy and positive.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As far as confidence-building exercises go, the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent 125-119 victory over the Pelicans was not necessarily Grade A material. The Pelicans have their own issues, and their star center Anthony Davis, who had hoped to be playing for the Lakers after this month\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline, was on a strict minutes limit as the Pelicans eye a summer sweepstakes for his services. (They would like to keep his limbs intact in the meantime.)'
b'But Walton\xe2\x80\x99s favorite verb after the game was \xe2\x80\x9cneed,\xe2\x80\x9d as in the Lakers needed the win and needed some positive vibes.'
b'Sure enough, Rondo helped a great deal, finishing with 16 assists, 11 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,\xe2\x80\x9d Walton said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s struggled a little bit, but some of that\xe2\x80\x99s on me. His minutes have been down. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to find different groups to work. But he\xe2\x80\x99s proven over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Rondo was not particularly adept from the perimeter, shooting 5 of 15 from the field, and Davis feasted on the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 smaller lineup when he was on the court. Walton knows those could be more pressing issues against better teams. But for one night, the Lakers (30-31) allowed themselves to savor some hard-earned momentum \xe2\x80\x94 because it might not last.'
b'The Lakers, who have been hindered this season by injuries and trade-deadline intrigue, are not a great basketball team. The question is whether they are merely mediocre, with a chance of still making the playoffs, or not very good at all, in which case they will have wasted their first year with James on the roster.'
b'It hardly helps that the Lakers have one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s most difficult schedules the rest of the way, starting Friday when they host the Milwaukee Bucks, who improved to 47-14 on Wednesday with a win against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 coming schedule also includes meetings with playoff-bound teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Toronto Raptors.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery day is going to be its own challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d James said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cJust try to stay positive throughout whatever\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Rondo had experienced his own set of challenges ahead of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game. He was coming off a pair of dreadful performances during the team\xe2\x80\x99s recent two-game trip, averaging 4.5 points and 2 assists off the bench while shooting 36.4 percent from the field. He was a nonfactor, or perhaps even a net negative.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the rhythm on both ends of the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d Rondo said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we have 82 games. You have the opportunity to play again and redeem yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'At Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s shootaround, center Tyson Chandler kept yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cenergy, energy, energy,\xe2\x80\x9d Rondo said. And during the game itself, the players focused on their body language \xe2\x80\x94 lots of hugs and high-fives \xe2\x80\x94 in addition to actually playing some defense for a change. Walton was also pleased that the Lakers had 37 assists to go with just eight turnovers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun when your guys are playing like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Forget that the Pelicans are struggling. Forget that James needed to sink a fadeaway 3-pointer from the corner with 31.3 seconds left to seal the win and sidestep disaster. Forget that Julius Randle, a center the Lakers let walk in free agency last summer, torched his old team for 35 points in the loss.'
b'Forget all this until Friday, when Rondo and the rest of the Lakers are sure to face an even stiffer challenge.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers has shown throughout his 16-year N.B.A. career that he is good at a lot of basketball-related activities, including scoring, passing, rebounding and winning. But perhaps one of his most remarkable assets \xe2\x80\x94 a feat, really \xe2\x80\x94 is his durability. He seldom misses games because of injury.'
b'But now, less than a week after turning 34, James is still on the mend from straining his left groin in a win over the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. The timetable for his return remains uncertain.'
b'The Lakers announced on Friday, before playing the visiting Knicks, that James would not make a coming trip with the team for back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday and the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. The Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 next game after that is on Wednesday against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center.'
b'The team said in its statement that James was making \xe2\x80\x9cprogress with his recovery\xe2\x80\x9d as he received daily treatment from the team\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff and that he would be re-evaluated in one week.'
b'Entering Friday, the Lakers had lost three of the four games they had played without James, dropping them to eighth place in the Western Conference standings with a 21-17 record \xe2\x80\x94 a precarious position for a team with playoff hopes. The Sacramento Kings were two games back in ninth place.'
b'James\xe2\x80\x99s absence has been compounded by the loss of Rajon Rondo, a veteran point guard who injured a ligament in his right ring finger against the Warriors and could miss three to four more weeks after undergoing surgery. Rondo had already missed 17 games this season because of a fractured bone in the same hand.'
b'Their absences have meant an increased reliance on the team\xe2\x80\x99s young core, which includes Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. Those players have delivered at times, but not consistently enough to manufacture many wins.'
b'As for James, he had been playing some of the finest basketball of his career, averaging 27.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists while shooting 51.8 percent from the field and 35.6 percent from 3-point range. He appeared in each of the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 first 34 games and had not missed a game since April 12, 2017, back when he was employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. That gave him a streak of 156 consecutive games played, including in the postseason.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI take a lot of pride in it,\xe2\x80\x9d James said of his sturdiness after injuring his groin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it pissed me off not to be able to go back into the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s more than anything being available to my teammates, being available to my coaching staff. That\xe2\x80\x99s something I take more personal than anything. Hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s not a long thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers initially listed James as day-to-day after he underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam. But Coach Luke Walton has said that the team will be cautious with James, who signed a four-year, $154 million deal in July.'
b'For much of his career, James has been able to ward off the corrosive effects of his profession \xe2\x80\x94 the daily wear and tear, the punishment from defenders. If nothing else, the last couple of weeks have revealed him to be at least semi-mortal, after all \xe2\x80\x94 and the Lakers are taking no chances, hoping they can remain afloat until he returns.'

b'DeMarcus Cousins is scheduled to make his long-anticipated debut with the Golden State Warriors during the team\xe2\x80\x99s Los Angeles road trip later this month, according to two people with knowledge of the team\xe2\x80\x99s plans.'
b'The Warriors will play the Clippers on Jan. 18 and the Lakers on Jan. 21, with Cousins expected to make his return from a torn Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 tendon he sustained in January 2018 in one of those two games, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.'
b'After Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s 122-95 rout of the Knicks on Tuesday night, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr would not make any promises but acknowledged that activating Cousins for either Jan. 18 or Jan. 21 is \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely the range.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as simple as, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the game\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in that neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that we are getting closer, like I told you guys yesterday, he\xe2\x80\x99s made some big strides the last week or two, conditioning-wise.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Cousins was in the midst of his best professional season with the New Orleans Pelicans last Jan. 26, when he tore his left Achilles late in a victory over the Houston Rockets.'
b'The injury cost Cousins his first career trip to the playoffs after six and a half fruitless seasons with the Sacramento Kings and also led to him signing a one-year, $5.3 million contract with the Warriors in July. The All-Star center found his options limited in free agency amid concerns about how he would recover from such a severe setback.'
b'The Warriors have been eager to see Cousins on the floor to finally address what has been one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s most frequently asked questions since they signed him: How will Cousins find a niche in Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s offense alongside four fellow All-Stars in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a great basketball player in terms of just feel and things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Curry told reporters Tuesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some fun moments out there.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think with the collective IQ we have in our locker room and just understanding the unselfishness around what we do that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to figure it out hopefully quickly. But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an adjustment for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Despite a well-chronicled lack of size on its roster, Golden State has been cautious in bringing Cousins back from what has historically been one of the most unforgiving injuries for basketball players. The Warriors have never had the luxury of fielding an offensive-minded center during their run of three championships over the past four years, but the position has been even more problematic this season after the third-year big man Damian Jones, having been moved into an expanded role, suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Jordan Bell, meanwhile, has struggled to establish a spot in Kerr\xe2\x80\x99s rotation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d Thompson said of Cousins\xe2\x80\x99s coming debut. \xe2\x80\x9cI know our fan base is excited, the N.B.A. is excited. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to integrate him into our team. He adds a whole new dimension, especially on the block. He\xe2\x80\x99s such a handful down there and with his ability to playmake.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'When Cousins does finally make it onto the court, Golden State will become the first team since the Boston Celtics in 1975-76 to be able to put five All-Stars from the previous season on the court. The Celtics did it that season with a lineup of Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek.'

b'The Knicks rookie is blocking shots at a rate unseen since the days of Manute Bol. On a bad team, he\xe2\x80\x99s a reason to keep watching.'
b'By Benjamin Hoffman'
b'Back in November, Mitchell Robinson showed the world what he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of.'
b'Robinson, the rookie Knicks center, absorbed contact under the basket from Orlando\xe2\x80\x99s Melvin Frazier and flopped to the court, hoping for a foul that was never called. Instead, the Magic passed the ball around a few times, finding a wide-open Jerian Grant in the corner, 22 feet from a supine Robinson.'
b'In three seconds that defied reasonable expectation, Robinson got to his feet, raced toward the corner and leapt into the air. He fully extended his lanky 7-foot-1 frame and swatted the 3-point attempt out of midair so matter-of-factly that Grant pulled his hands toward his body, looking almost sorry that he had attempted the shot.'
b'The block was Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s eighth of the game, setting a Knicks rookie record (which he stretched to nine blocks by the end of the night). But beyond the block\xe2\x80\x99s impact in the moment, the play illustrated the 20-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this season. The perception may be that the Knicks are tanking in hopes of drafting Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Zion Williamson, but for Robinson, any shot an opponent takes is a chance for him to get a block \xe2\x80\x94 and he is not going to be cheated out of any of them, even if the shooter is beyond the 3-point line. As a result, a mostly irrelevant team has become must-watch television.'
b'Last time we met the Magic @thegarden, @23savage____ set the Knicks rookie record for blocks \xe2\x9c\x8b Another block party tonight? \xf0\x9f\x91\x80 pic.twitter.com/3RgRQoROec'
b'The Knicks had not forgotten that November block when the Magic came back to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The team posted a video of the play on Twitter, wondering if history would repeat. The post proved prophetic, as Robinson led the way in a 108-103 victory for the Knicks with 17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 blocks and 3 steals in 33 minutes off the bench. Four of the blocks came in just 40 seconds in the second quarter.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe kid is making history right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Knicks Coach David Fizdale said of Robinson after the win. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s putting himself in groups with historic names. Every single day he continues to grow and get better.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 two-game winning streak ended on Thursday with a disappointing 125-118 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. But even in defeat, Robinson managed to add to his highlight reel, this time with a shot an opponent didn\xe2\x80\x99t take. '
b'It was early in the second quarter, and Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova got the ball with a clean look at the basket from 3-point range. As he prepared to shoot, he noticed Robinson a few feet in front of him, with the rookie lowering his shoulder slightly as he prepared to leap. Dellavedova immediately thought better of trying his luck and passed the ball instead. A few seconds later on the same possession, Robinson got his block anyway, swatting away a layup attempt from Marquese Chriss.'
b'A rare prep-to-pro N.B.A. player as a result of his complicated withdrawal from Western Kentucky University, Robinson has been limited to 18.6 minutes a game as he works to refine his game, but he is still third in the N.B.A. at 2.3 blocks a game. When rated by block percentage, which estimates the percentage of an opponents\xe2\x80\x99 shots a player blocks in his time on the floor, Robinson is nothing short of stunning, at 10.4 percent.'
b'Basketball Reference has tracked block percentage back to the 1973-74 season, and the top-four seasons among players with 100 or more blocks belong to Manute Bol, the 7-foot-7 shot-blocking savant. No. 5 on the list belongs to Robinson. '
b'Sample size obviously needs to be considered, but Robinson stands a chance of being the only qualified player beyond Bol and Alonzo Mourning to finish a season with a block percentage higher than 10. Rim protection luminaries such as Serge Ibaka (9.8), Mark Eaton (9.2) and Dikembe Mutombo (8.8) all fell short of that mark in their best seasons. '
b'Robinson, who has quickly become a fan favorite, believes he is just getting started. He was asked recently how many shots he could block a game if the team let him play 30 minutes a night. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably around six,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I can get like six.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The N.B.A. season record for blocks per game is 5.6, set by Eaton in 1984-85, yet Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s boast does not seem all that far-fetched, largely because of his unusual ability to block shots along the perimeter as well as under the basket.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis potential is crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d Emmanuel Mudiay, the Knicks guard, told reporters before Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s probably the best shot-blocker I ever played with in my life. In my opinion, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best shot-blocker in the league.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Fizdale has said that Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and execution have improved since the team acquired DeAndre Jordan to serve as his mentor. The numbers back that up, as Robinson has averaged 11 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.2 blocks a game since Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s arrival on Jan. 31, while still averaging only 23.1 minutes a night. He has also continued to pester outside shooters, with eight of his 35 blocks in February coming on 3-point attempts. '
b'Fizdale was asked recently if Robinson compared to any other players he had coached. The coach, who has worked with excellent rim protectors like Marc Gasol, Jermaine O\xe2\x80\x99Neal and Chris Andersen, spoke about his rookie like a proud father.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a different guy, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got so much more room to grow. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep my foot way up his butt to make sure he does.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'That could be terrible news for anyone looking to get a shot off against the Knicks in the coming years. They might find there is no place to hide.'

b'Duke was given the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball tournament Sunday night, starting Coach Mike Krzyzewski and his star freshman Zion Williamson on a path to what they hope will be the Blue Devils\xe2\x80\x99 sixth national title.'
b'Duke (29-5) was one of three Atlantic Coast Conference teams to receive top seeds, joining Virginia (29-3) and North Carolina (27-6). It was the second time members of the same conference were named three of the four No. 1s; the Big East did so in 2009.'
b'The fourth No. 1 seed was Gonzaga (30-3), the small stalwart from Spokane, Wash. While the Bulldogs lost the West Coast Conference title game to St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s last week, they already have a win over Duke on their r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 from a tournament in late November in Hawaii.'
b'[Region previews: East | West | South | Midwest]'
b'Of course, a top seed is no ticket to the Final Four in Minneapolis. Or even to the second round. Last year, for the first time in 136 such games, a No. 16 seed defeated a No. 1 when the University of Maryland-Baltimore County stunned Virginia.'
b'The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans \xe2\x80\x94 who won all three games against their in-state rival this season \xe2\x80\x94 landed in Duke\xe2\x80\x99s dreaded quadrant.'
b'The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.'
b'The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke\xe2\x80\x99s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey earned their right to be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS\xe2\x80\x99s selection show to discuss the bracket.'
b'The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 a game they surely will not take for granted after last year \xe2\x80\x94 they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.'
b'The South final could well feature No. 2-seeded Tennessee (29-5) or No. 3-seeded Purdue (23-9). Both teams are ranked in the top 10 of KenPom.com\xe2\x80\x99s efficiency ratings, a list Virginia sits atop. And either might have home-court advantage at Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s KFC Yum Center.'

b'The region also features two prominent conference champions: sixth-seeded Villanova (25-9), the current Big East and defending national champion, and seventh-seeded Cincinnati (28-6), which won the American Athletic Conference tournament on Sunday.'
b'In addition to Michigan State, the land mines in the East between Duke and the Final Four could include fourth-seeded Virginia Tech (24-8), which defeated the Williamson-less Blue Devils last month, and third-seeded Louisiana State (26-6), a talented squad that is without Coach Will Wade. He was suspended after a report emerged that he had discussed making an offer to a recruit on a phone call with an aspiring agent convicted of fraud in college recruiting.'
b'The East has other ties to scandal. Seventh-seeded Louisville (20-13) faces 10th-seeded Minnesota (21-13) in the first round, a game that might have been a father-son matchup between Rick and Richard Pitino had the former not been let go as Louisville\xe2\x80\x99s coach in 2017 shortly after corruption allegations became public. And L.S.U.\xe2\x80\x99s first game is against No. 14 Yale (21-7), the Ivy League co-champion, whose women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer program was caught up in the admissions scandal that federal prosecutors revealed last week.'
b'In the national semifinals, the East winner, which will be determined in Washington, will face the West winner. In addition to Gonzaga and Michigan, contenders in that region include third-seeded Texas Tech (26-6), which was considered the best team in the strong Big 12 but was upset in the conference tournament by West Virginia (14-20); and fourth-seeded Florida State (27-7), which looked every bit Duke\xe2\x80\x99s equal in the first half of the A.C.C. title game on Saturday. The West also features two mid-major darlings: No. 6 Buffalo (31-3) and No. 7 Nevada (29-4). The West Regional is in Anaheim, Calif.'
b'North Carolina and Kentucky are fish out of water in the Midwest region, particularly given its setting. In the region semifinals, the Tar Heels could meet fourth-seeded Kansas (25-9), making its record-setting 30th straight N.C.A.A. tournament appearance, while the Wildcats might face sixth-seeded Iowa State (23-11). Those games will take place at Sprint Center in Kansas City, Mo. \xe2\x80\x94 a second home for the Jayhawks and Iowa State, who have combined to win the last seven Big 12 tournaments there.'
b'The Midwest also features fifth-seeded Auburn (25-9), the surprise Southeastern Conference winner Sunday. Tigers Coach Bruce Pearl, hired in 2014, was effectively barred from N.C.A.A. coaching for three years for recruiting violations at Tennessee. Chuck Person, a former Auburn assistant, was charged with bribery and fraud in the recruiting cases, and last Friday, prosecutors said in a court filing that Person was expected to plead guilty on Tuesday.'
b'The Big Ten led all conferences with eight teams in the tournament, while the Pacific-12 had only three. That number was actually larger than expected a week ago: Arizona State was given one of the last four at-large bids, and Oregon (23-13) surprised Washington (26-8) in the tournament final Saturday night to elbow its way into the field.'
b'The Ducks were one of several unlikely receivers of automatic spots who effectively constricted the pool of 36 at-large bids. In another example, St. Louis (23-12) won the Atlantic 10 tournament Sunday, granting the Billikens a slot alongside Virginia Commonwealth (25-7), which effectively took an at-large bid away from a bubble team by failing to win its conference tournament.'
b'This was the first year in decades that the N.C.A.A. did not use the much-maligned Rating Percentage Index, instead favoring the new N.C.A.A. Evaluation Tool. But the tournament field included 11th-seeded Arizona State (22-10) in its \xe2\x80\x9clast four in\xe2\x80\x9d despite the Sun Devils\xe2\x80\x99 poor NET, while North Carolina State (22-11), a good-NET, bad-R.P.I. squad, was not even among the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst four out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But aficionados will be pleased that Belmont (26-5) of the Ohio Valley earned an at-large bid; the Bruins will play Temple in the play-in game on Tuesday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey made the most of the opportunities they had,\xe2\x80\x9d Muir said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just thought they were a phenomenal basketball team, very high on the offensive front \xe2\x80\x94 great offensive efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'St. John\xe2\x80\x99s (21-12) was the last team in; the Red Storm will face Arizona State in an opening game on Wednesday.'

b'The rare N.B.A. star willing to lean into his role as a villain, Butler, briefly back in the city he scorned, is ready to absorb fans\xe2\x80\x99 anger.'
b'By Marc Stein'
b'Jimmy Butler knows what\xe2\x80\x99s coming on Saturday night in Minneapolis. He understands, relishes and even encourages the looming prospect of the chilliest welcome any visiting N.B.A. player is bound to receive this season.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to boo me,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said of the Minnesota fans who watched him force his way out of town via a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers in November \xe2\x80\x94 months after Butler led the woebegone Timberwolves to their first playoff berth in 14 seasons.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would boo me, too. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lie to you.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Now a key member of what is widely regarded as the most potent starting lineup on the N.B.A. map outside of Golden State, Butler will be back at Target Center for the first time since the trade turmoil that captivated the league for the first two months of the season.'
b'Butler insisted he was unfazed by what awaited him, and went on to suggest that a number of his Philadelphia colleagues, as well as some longtime friends who plan to be in attendance, will partake in the inevitable hostilities.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI might actually join in on the boos,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said.'
b'Those who have spent any time around the rugged swingman surely don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt it. At a time when N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver openly frets about player happiness \xe2\x80\x94 and when standouts such as Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Kyrie Irving and Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Durant routinely rail against the approach of some of the news media \xe2\x80\x94 Butler is the rare star who savors the game\xe2\x80\x99s edgy side and has embraced his portrayal as a villain.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love it,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said in a phone interview, repeating the phrase three times \xe2\x80\x94 including once with a profanity for emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to be loved all the time?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need everybody to like me. I know who I am. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that enough. I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m about. I know where my heart is. People will say, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s this way, or he\xe2\x80\x99s that way,\xe2\x80\x99 but nobody knows except for the people around me every day. Ask them and they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you differently.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Elton Brand, the 76ers\xe2\x80\x99 general manager, certainly falls within that category, describing Butler as \xe2\x80\x9ca caring person\xe2\x80\x9d who has quickly endeared himself \xe2\x80\x9cnot only to his teammates but to our whole business operations staff and in the community.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'As a first-year general manager, Brand had his own reservations before going through with the first major move of his tenure, having watched chaos engulf the Timberwolves from afar \xe2\x80\x94 with no shortage of the noise coming from Butler himself after news leaked of the mid-September trade request he made in private.'
b'But when Brand did his research, consulting former coaches and executives who had worked with Butler, along with former players he knew well who had firsthand knowledge, such as Nazr Mohammed and Mike Dunleavy Jr., he received little in the way of dissenting feedback.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven with the story that was reported, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Brand said, referring to an ESPN report in January that asserted Butler \xe2\x80\x9caggressively challenged\xe2\x80\x9d Philadelphia Coach Brett Brown. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t curse. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t loud. It was his reputation following him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Butler, 29, admitted in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Haynes that he is a \xe2\x80\x9cconfrontational\xe2\x80\x9d teammate, but that he is also trying to be more selective in showing his blunt nature as he gets older. It should be noted that, as Brand found, Butler has also been a largely popular teammate in his stints with the Chicago Bulls and Team U.S.A. \xe2\x80\x94 and, frankly, with numerous Timberwolves apart from the All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.'
b'Butler took a hit in some precincts after informing the since-fired coach with whom he\xe2\x80\x99s so closely associated \xe2\x80\x94 Tom Thibodeau \xe2\x80\x94 that he was no longer interested in trying to nurture Towns and Andrew Wiggins and wanted out of Minnesota. One example of the damage: Butler is one of the top 12 players in the Eastern Conference, but East coaches snubbed him as a reserve for the All-Star Game in February.'
b'Yet Butler plays on, insisting he would \xe2\x80\x9cdo nothing over\xe2\x80\x9d in Minnesota and reveling in the knowledge that for the first time in his career, he\xe2\x80\x99s on a team capable of getting to the N.B.A. finals.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of talent,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said.'
b'The Sixers haven\xe2\x80\x99t established the required consistency to earn the label of East favorites, going 11-6 since the All-Star break with middling placement in both offensive (18th) and defensive (12th) efficiency in that span. Butler, though, is doing what he can to make it work, sacrificing in a manner that would seem to invalidate some of the criticism.'
b'Philadelphia followed its trade for Butler on Nov. 12 by acquiring Tobias Harris from the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6, giving Brown two All-Star-caliber players to team with the dynamic duo of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the shooter extraordinaire J.J. Redick. In the first 20 games since, when those five players share the floor, Butler has scaled back more than anyone, taking fewer shots (46) than the other four \xe2\x80\x94 with Embiid by far in the lead (95 shots).'
b'Of course, in fourth quarters, Butler has emerged as the most reliable offensive option of the quintet, shooting 12 for 18 when all five play together, highlighted by last week\xe2\x80\x99s game-winning jumper against Boston after the Celtics had won six of the teams\xe2\x80\x99 seven previous meetings. The natural drop in Butler\xe2\x80\x99s per-game averages this season, playing for such a loaded team, tends to overshadow the fact that he still ranks 16th in the league in a category (Real Plus-Minus) strongly associated with team success.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a special talent at closing and winning games \xe2\x80\x94 and not just offensively,\xe2\x80\x9d Brand said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just a winner.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An indication of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s true standing in the game will come July 1, when he becomes an unrestricted free agent for the first time. Brand has said repeatedly that he hopes to keep Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s new core four together, but Butler is expected to attract serious interest from both Los Angeles teams as well as the Nets. The Clippers\xe2\x80\x99 special adviser Jerry West, to name one prominent fan, is said to be a longtime admirer of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s two-way impact.'
b'Not that Butler is prepared to discuss much about the future. He brushed off free-agency talk in our conversation and claimed that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Minnesota was on this week\xe2\x80\x99s calendar until I told him.'
b'He stuck mostly to peripheral subjects. Those include Butler\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to playing dominoes and Uno, his friendship with \xe2\x80\x9cthe best soccer player in the world\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Paris St.-Germain\xe2\x80\x99s Brazilian star Neymar \xe2\x80\x94 and the trusty American football he travels around with. Butler said he plans to toss the football with other 76ers with greater regularity during the playoffs.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you \xe2\x80\x94 it takes away some of that pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said.'
b'Thibodeau still lives in Minneapolis in the wake of his Jan. 6 firing, but politely declined to comment about Butler\xe2\x80\x99s visit. Butler, for his part, continues to refer to Thibodeau as \xe2\x80\x9cmy guy.\xe2\x80\x9d He said they maintained regular contact.'
b'Although Butler remains unwilling to dig deeply into the reasons he pushed so hard for an exit so soon after the dramatic impact he had in his lone full season with the Wolves, give him this: He is prepared to take whatever pent-up frustration has been stored up for him in the Twin Cities.'
b'Rather than ask for forgiveness from the locals, or even civility, Butler said: \xe2\x80\x9cI did what I did. I\xe2\x80\x99m cool with it. I\xe2\x80\x99m in a good place.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He has only one request for the basketball public: Pick someone else to win the East besides the up-and-down Sixers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pick us,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope people say we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose in the first round. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anybody to think we\xe2\x80\x99re that good because I think it makes us play a little bit harder.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said.'
b'The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had \xe2\x80\x9cstruck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim\xe2\x80\x99s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said.'
b'The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night\xe2\x80\x99s accident,\xe2\x80\x9d Boeheim said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cJuli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. \xe2\x80\x9cCoach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years.'
b'Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49.'

b'Four of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s play.'
b'The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace.'
b'The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings.'
b'The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team\xe2\x80\x99s big-picture outlook \xe2\x80\x94 with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in.'
b'What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do.'
b'(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s games.)'
b'1. Toronto Raptors (32-12)'
b'The Raptors were this season\xe2\x80\x99s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay.'
b'2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12)'
b'Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league\xe2\x80\x99s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule.'
b'3. Golden State Warriors (28-14) Maybe the Warriors do not inspire the fear they once did. Maybe their defensive woes (having slipped to 16th in defensive efficiency) are a sign of true vulnerability. Or maybe, with DeMarcus Cousins just days away from making his long-awaited debut, Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s season is about to start for real. I tend to believe it is the latter, in Year 5 of a historic run, having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular-season motivation.'
b'[Read: DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup]'
b'4. Denver Nuggets (28-13)'
b'The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West \xe2\x80\x94 Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s conference \xe2\x80\x94 for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender \xe2\x80\x94 or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth.'
b'5. Oklahoma City (26-16)'
b'Remember the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s 0-4 start? Neither do we. Despite the season-long absence of the ace defender Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating (allowing just 102.9 points per 100 possessions) and specializes in the physical style that has troubled Golden State in the past. The Thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what ranks as the league\xe2\x80\x99s second-easiest schedule to date, but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than Russell Westbrook and Paul George.'
b'6. Houston Rockets (24-17)'
b'Earlier this season, I responded to the Rockets\xe2\x80\x99 disappointing start and Chris Paul\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing hamstring issues by stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for James Harden and Co. Houston is 7-2 since Dec. 24 \xe2\x80\x94 with Harden averaging a mere 41.0 points (and 16.7 3-point attempts!) per game in that stretch. Write the Rockets off if you wish, but Harden\xe2\x80\x99s brilliance, augmented by a resurgent Clint Capela and the newcomer Austin Rivers, should give you pause.'
b'7. Indiana Pacers (28-14)'
b'Surprise No. 1: Only six teams in the league, according to Basketball-Reference.com\xe2\x80\x99s projections, will finish the season with at least 50 wins. Surprise No. 2: Indiana is on that list, ahead of higher-profile teams like Philadelphia and Oklahoma City, despite the fact that the All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has missed 11 games with a knee problem. Coach Nate McMillan, continuity and a top-two defense have the unfashionable Pacers overachieving \xe2\x80\x94 again.'
b'8. San Antonio Spurs (25-19)'
b'This season\xe2\x80\x99s 11-14 start marked the first time Gregg Popovich has ever sported a sub-.500 record after 25 games and included a four-game stretch in which the Spurs unfathomably suffered three losses in excess of 30 points. The ensuing turnaround, though, has been no less remarkable. San Antonio is 14-5 and ranks No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency in that span, led by the midrange maestros DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge flat-out ignoring the league\xe2\x80\x99s 3-point revolution.'
b'9. Boston Celtics (25-17)'
b'The numbers continue to say that the Celtics are fine. They have a per-game average point differential (+6.4) that ranks second only to Milwaukee\xe2\x80\x99s (+9.1). Boston is also one of just four teams (along with Milwaukee, Toronto and Denver) to rank in the top 10 in both offensive (ninth) and defensive (fourth) efficiency. The problem: Boston just followed up an impressive rout of Indiana with losses in Miami and Orlando that suggested yet again that things are not fine.'
b'10. Philadelphia 76ers (27-16)'
b'For all the creative tension that has bubbled around the Sixers since they acquired Jimmy Butler on Nov. 10, they have the fourth-best overall record in that span (19-10) despite well-chronicled concerns about shooting and depth around Philadelphia\xe2\x80\x99s star trio as well as the occasional squawking. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has been less than seamless, as predicted, but stockpiling as much talent as possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the N.B.A. way.'
b'11. Utah Jazz (23-21)'
b'The Jazz have risen to a more familiar No. 5 in defensive efficiency and contend that their road-heavy schedule, with 25 of the first 41 games away, has contributed mightily to keeping them out of the West\xe2\x80\x99s top eight for much of the season. But to resemble the team most experts thought it would be, Utah needs Donovan Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s January resurgence to last, as well as a return to last season\xe2\x80\x99s standards from Joe Ingles.'
b'12. Portland Trail Blazers (26-17)'
b'One of my faulty predictions from last year asserted that 2018 would be the year that the Trail Blazers finally broke up the Damian Lillard/C.J. McCollum partnership as a means to build a more balanced roster. Portland has instead clung to the hope that Jusuf Nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it has needed for ages. It is a better team than last season\xe2\x80\x99s version but only marginally \xe2\x80\x94 and still vulnerable to athletic opposition.'
b'13. Los Angeles Lakers (23-20)'
b'Winning without LeBron James is hard. Who knew? The Lakers are 3-6 since James suffered a strained groin in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State. As a result, they have slid from a higher-than-expected No. 4 to an uncomfortable No. 8 in the West \xe2\x80\x94 thus resurrecting all the preseason questions about L.A.\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make the playoffs with, shall we say, such an eclectic roster. James appears likely, at 34, to miss more than the 11 games Stephen Curry lost to a similar injury in November.'
b'14. Los Angeles Clippers (24-18)'
b'I fear they are at high risk to slip out of the West\xe2\x80\x99s top eight, but the Clippers would certainly slot in right at the top of the play-hard rankings if there were such an industry. The feisty likes of Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley, flanking a better-than-ever Tobias Harris, continue to make the Clippers more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free-agent noise in franchise history.'
b'15. Sacramento Kings (22-21)'
b'A Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater to topple the Lakers on Dec. 27 hiked the fast-paced Kings\xe2\x80\x99 record to 19-16 and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of De\xe2\x80\x99Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield as certifiable playoff material after a league-high 12 consecutive seasons of missing out. Sacramento then unraveled, enduring a 1-5 funk which included an embarrassing fall-from-ahead loss at Phoenix when the Suns were without Devin Booker. You cannot afford funks in the West.'
b'16. Miami Heat (21-20)'
b'Little emanating from South Beach makes sense, whether it is Miami\xe2\x80\x99s ability to play .500 basketball despite missing out on Butler via trade and having Goran Dragic healthy for just 14 games \xe2\x80\x94 or the fact this team is 0-3 against Atlanta. It is unclear how long it will take Miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s caliber, but the retiring Dwyane Wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage.'
b'17. Brooklyn Nets (21-23)'
b'The drop-off from the East\xe2\x80\x99s top five to teams trying to secure the last three playoff stops is as steep as pessimists feared. Not that the Nets intend to apologize after the barren half-decade they endured in the wake of their disastrous 2014 trade with Boston. While the Knicks tank their way to a shot at Zion Williamson, New Yorkers may get postseason games after all, thanks to success stories like Spencer Dinwiddie, D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo Russell, Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen.'
b'18. New Orleans Pelicans (20-23)'
b'It is a misnomer to say Anthony Davis has no help; Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle are all accomplished players. The Pelicans\xe2\x80\x99 problems have been health (most notably injuries for Mirotic and the point guard Elfrid Payton) and difficulties in playing Davis, Mirotic and Randle together even when they are all available. New Orleans, as a result, is facing the biggest possible issue: Scenarios that force them to trade The Brow grow more plausible by the day.'
b'19. Washington Wizards (18-25)'
b'Indiana has crashed the East\xe2\x80\x99s upper crust to give the conference its own Fab Five, but we were not exaggerating the drop-off to the chasing pack. Look no further than the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital for proof, with the Wizards still firmly in the playoff chase despite losing John Wall to season-ending heel surgery. Recent wins over Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Milwaukee should tell you that the Wiz are not heeding some fans\xe2\x80\x99 calls to tank.'
b'20. Dallas Mavericks (20-22)'
b'Luka Doncic has a real shot to become the first rookie to achieve All-Star status since Blake Griffin in 2011, which already makes this a more successful season in Dallas than many forecast. But the huge disparity between the Mavericks\xe2\x80\x99 play at home (16-4) and on the road (4-18), Dirk Nowitzki\xe2\x80\x99s health woes in what they hoped would be a heartwarming final season and J.J. Barea\xe2\x80\x99s season-ending Achilles tear, have combined to snuff out some of the joy.'
b'[Read: The Mavericks\xe2\x80\x99 Key to Keeping Players Fresh? Blood Samples]'
b'21. Minnesota Timberwolves (21-22) As regular readers know, Glen Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s passive ownership style is a frequent source of consternation for the Committee. But give Taylor this: Firing Tom Thibodeau when he did to replace him with the 32-year-old Ryan Saunders, bizarre as the timing seemed, meant eating an estimated $20 million left on Thibodeau\xe2\x80\x99s contract. If only Taylor was that decisive back in June or July when the Wolves really needed to start dealing with Butler\xe2\x80\x99s discontent.'
b'22. Charlotte Hornets (19-23)'
b'The Michael Jordan-owned Hornets have All-Star Weekend hosting duties in a month to assure the franchise and city a measure of prominence this season. But what they, especially Jordan, really want is a playoff berth that is by no means certain given the limited scoring punch Charlotte can field beyond its do-everything guard Kemba Walker. It also does not help that the Hornets have already racked up a league-high eight costly losses in one-possession games.'
b'23. Detroit Pistons (18-23)'
b'Since it hit my radar during an early season visit to Motown, it has been one of my favorite stats of the season: Blake Griffin leads the league in touches per game at 93.3. Nikola Jokic and Harden are the only others in 90s, but the number doubles as an illustration of the Pistons\xe2\x80\x99 shortcomings as much as it spotlights Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s special ability as a power player to handle the ball like a guard. He is clearly compensating for multiple holes in the roster.'
b'24. Memphis Grizzlies (19-23)'
b'Memphis has nose-dived from a West-leading record of 12-5 on Thanksgiving, losing 18 of 25 games while the former All-Star center Marc Gasol has been submerged in a slump that has shown few signs of relenting. The fade may not only cost the Grizzlies a playoff berth but also threaten to extend Mike Conley\xe2\x80\x99s career-long wait for an All-Star berth, since team success is bound to be factored in to the votes of the media panel and coaches given the glut of worthy guards in the West.'
b'25. Orlando Magic (18-24)'
b'The Magic reeled off seven wins in a nine-game stretch in November under new coach Steve Clifford to spawn hopes that competing for a spot in the inviting lower reaches of the East\xe2\x80\x99s playoff ladder was feasible. Two months later, apart from the career-best season assembled by the veteran big man Nikola Vucevic, Orlando is back on course for a ninth successive trip to the lottery and remains as desperate as Phoenix for an upgrade at point guard.'
b'26. Atlanta Hawks (13-29)'
b'If the Hawks finish where they are as the so-called best of the worst, they will have a 10.5 percent shot at the No. 1 overall pick in June in the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s new lottery system, which flattens out the odds to 14 percent each for teams with the three-worst records. In the interim, Trae Young\xe2\x80\x99s development is the overwhelming focus, which makes it difficult not to partake in obsessing over how Young is shooting from the field (.394) and 3-point range (.291).'
b'27. Phoenix Suns (11-33)'
b'Deandre Ayton\xe2\x80\x99s Rookie of the Year campaign would appear to be the only pleasant diversion for one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s longest-suffering fan bases amid Phoenix\xe2\x80\x99s ninth straight non-playoff season, Booker\xe2\x80\x99s various health woes and the owner Robert Sarver\xe2\x80\x99s struggles to secure public financing for the renovation of the Suns\xe2\x80\x99 downtown arena. Yet I cannot say I love Ayton\xe2\x80\x99s chances after witnessing up close how badly he was outplayed by the R.O.Y. favorite Doncic last week.'
b'28. New York Knicks (10-32)'
b'Will the Knicks really hold Kristaps Porzingis out for the entire season? Will the Knicks trade Enes Kanter? Will the Knicks get lucky in the June draft? Those three questions have dominated Coach David Fizdale\xe2\x80\x99s first season in New York while this franchise waits for its opportunity in July to see if it can really make the long-awaited splash in free agency that many league observers legitimately expect after two mostly hapless decades.'
b'29. Chicago Bulls (10-33)'
b'Jim Boylen is still running some long practices, but things have mellowed (at least somewhat) between the Bulls and their feisty new coach after the initial wave of wind sprints, push-ups and disagreements. While Boylen works to secure a return next season, it is all about development for the rest of this season for the few keepers on the roster \xe2\x80\x94 most notably Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine and Wendell Carter Jr. \xe2\x80\x94 and finding new homes for Jabari Parker and Robin Lopez.'
b'30. Cleveland Cavaliers (8-35)'
b'In the four years between James\xe2\x80\x99s two stints with his home-state franchise, Cleveland somehow won the N.B.A. draft lottery three times: 2011 (Kyrie Irving), 2013 (Anthony Bennett) and 2014 (Andrew Wiggins). Dreams of getting lucky again and earning the right to select Zion Williamson may be the only source of comfort for Cavaliers fans to get through what surely must feel like the longest of winters watching such hopeless basketball.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 At the end of a disastrous season in which the Los Angeles Lakers failed to make the playoffs, despite having added LeBron James via free agency, Magic Johnson made the stunning announcement on Tuesday that he was stepping down as the team\xe2\x80\x99s president of basketball operations.'
b'Johnson delivered the news at an impromptu news conference before the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 regular-season finale, against the Portland Trail Blazers, and he said he had not yet informed Jeanie Buss, the team\xe2\x80\x99s controlling owner. In fact, he had told nearly no one before he addressed a mass of hastily assembled reporters.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t face her to tell her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to Buss. He later added that he would find her at Staples Center to address her in person.'
b'Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you \xf0\x9f\x92\x9c\xf0\x9f\x92\x9b https://t.co/ofmQl6BtBz'
b'Later, the team released a statement, calling Johnson \xe2\x80\x9cnot only a Lakers icon, but our family.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'[Magic Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s biggest moments running the Lakers.]'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement read, using Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s formal name. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise \xe2\x80\x94 as a player, an ambassador and an executive.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The statement continued, \xe2\x80\x9cAs we begin the process of moving forward, we will work in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMeasured\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmethodical\xe2\x80\x9d would be an about-face from the way Johnson stepped down. It was a surreal scene as he fielded questions for nearly 45 minutes after he made his announcement, appearing to hold back tears at times, and repeatedly said that he loved Buss like a sister. He then posed for pictures with team employees, former teammates and a local news anchor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go back to having fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson, 59, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go back to being who I was before taking on this job, and we\xe2\x80\x99re halfway there with LeBron coming. I think this summer, with that other star coming in \xe2\x80\x94 whoever\xe2\x80\x99s going to come in \xe2\x80\x94 I think this team is going to be in position to really contend for a championship with the growth of the other young players.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Johnson was named to the post in February 2017 and said at the time that it was \xe2\x80\x9ca dream come true.\xe2\x80\x9d But on Tuesday he said that he wanted to get back to being a mentor and a businessman, and that he had felt limited in his ability to do those things in his current role.'
b'For example, he said he was upset that he could not attend Dwyane Wade\xe2\x80\x99s final game for the Miami Heat on Tuesday night \xe2\x80\x94 or congratulate Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Twitter for finishing the regular season averaging another triple-double. (Johnson said the league would have considered it \xe2\x80\x9ctampering.\xe2\x80\x9d)'
b'Johnson also said that he had received a phone call last week from the tennis star Serena Williams, asking if he would be an adviser to her.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Serena called me, wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love helping people.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI like to be free. And then I got a great life outside of this. What am I doing? I got a beautiful life, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to that beautiful life, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But there is palace intrigue at play, too \xe2\x80\x94 these are the Lakers, after all \xe2\x80\x94 and Johnson strongly indicated that he had been leaning toward firing Coach Luke Walton. Buss, though, is known to think highly of Walton, a former Laker who has been the team\xe2\x80\x99s coach for three seasons, and Johnson suggested that he did not want to go through with it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would have to affect someone\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood and their life,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thought about that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fun for me. That\xe2\x80\x99s not who I am, and then I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put her in the middle of us, even though she said, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, do what you want to do.\xe2\x80\x99 I know she has great love for him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Lakers, who have been downtrodden in recent years, are still one of the most glamorous franchises in the league, and Johnson, who helped the Lakers win five championships as a Hall of Fame point guard, remains one of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s most popular figures.'
b'Johnson was hired to replace Jim Buss, the brother of Jeanie Buss. Johnson, who had previously been a partial owner of the team as well, worked alongside Rob Pelinka, a former agent, who was brought in as the team\xe2\x80\x99s general manager. (Johnson said that he had not told Pelinka of his decision to step down, either.)'
b'While Johnson had some memorable moments at the helm of the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 operation, the roster that he and Pelinka built around James was widely considered inadequate. After losing to Portland in their finale, the Lakers had a record of 37-45, which assured them of missing the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. It is the first losing effort by a James-led team since the star forward\xe2\x80\x99s rookie season in 2003-04, when his Cleveland Cavaliers went 35-47.'
b'On Tuesday, Johnson preached patience.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m excited about the direction,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before he headed out the door.'

b'Keeping Score'
b'James\xe2\x80\x99s first season with the Lakers has been disappointing, but passing his idol in career scoring goes beyond winning and losing.'
b'By Benjamin Hoffman'
b'There was no Instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time. There was relatively little buildup from the news media. It was an event that might have dominated the news cycle in years\xe2\x80\x99 past, but when LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s career scoring list on Wednesday night, it was a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnote.'
b'James came into the Los Angeles Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 game against the Denver Nuggets needing 13 points to surpass Jordan for fourth place on the career list. With 5 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter, he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup, giving him 14 points for the game and 32,294 for his career. For good measure, he was fouled on the play. '
b'After a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment, play resumed as the Lakers, clinging to the last shreds of their playoff hopes, tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponent.'
b'LeBron passes Michael Jordan on all-time scoring list pic.twitter.com/G2tAovqMrz'
b'The Lakers, led by an unlikely group of bench players, did make a run at Denver, reducing a 17-point deficit at halftime to 2 points with 8:37 left in the fourth quarter. But the Nuggets regained their footing and ran away with a 115-99 victory, spoiling a night in which James contributed 31 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists, looking far more energized on both ends of the court than he had in recent weeks, and finishing the night with his career point total up to 32,311. '
b'James, who has taken the brunt of the criticism for the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 failings in a difficult first year in Los Angeles, had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game, but was measured when discussing it with reporters earlier in the day.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI take all accomplishments as they come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny time I\xe2\x80\x99m in the breath with any other greats \xe2\x80\x94 and obviously M.J. being the guy that I looked up to my whole life, the guy I admired as a kid \xe2\x80\x94 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be pretty cool.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Jordan, who owns the Charlotte Hornets, issued a brief statement on Thursday, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career.\xe2\x80\x9d The statement was notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when Kobe Bryant passed him on the career scoring list in 2014.'
b'One would hardly have guessed from either man\xe2\x80\x99s words that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport\xe2\x80\x99s signature statistic. The inability for James to truly celebrate the moment was yet another indignity in a season full of them.'
b'It was a little more than a year ago when James had seemingly settled into a groove. He scored his 30,000th point \xe2\x80\x94 a feat he congratulated himself about on Instagram hours before he actually accomplished it. With that hurdle cleared, and with recent championship runs in Miami and Cleveland under his belt, his march toward challenging Jordan, then Bryant, then Karl Malone and maybe even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s career scoring leader, seemed as if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his career.'
b'A decision \xe2\x80\x94 a loaded word when it comes to James \xe2\x80\x94 to move to an ill-prepared Lakers team in the off-season has changed the calculus altogether. The team was predicted by most to struggle to make the playoffs in the West thanks to its collection of too-young players and veterans who do not complement James. Nevertheless, many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team\xe2\x80\x99s struggles despite having James, a player whose presence has seemingly guaranteed a finals appearance for close to a decade.'
b'As a result, James and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishments. Just last week he passed Andre Miller to move into 10th place in career assists, thus making him the only player currently in the top 10 in both career points and assists. That feat \xe2\x80\x94 it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other players going back to the days of Bob Cousy \xe2\x80\x94 was met with a collective shrug.'
b'It is a reality of James\xe2\x80\x99s life that he acknowledged on Wednesday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t really appreciated anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to accomplish because I\xe2\x80\x99m so engulfed in what\xe2\x80\x99s next,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I can continue to get better; how I can help this franchise get back to where it needs to be.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An occasional season of missing the playoffs is not unusual for most players \xe2\x80\x94 even the great ones \xe2\x80\x94 but to capture how truly rare it would be for a James-led team, consider that he has played double-digit playoff games in each of the last 13 years. He has appeared in nine N.B.A. finals \xe2\x80\x94 winning three \xe2\x80\x94 and as a result his career rankings among playoff performers come off as outrageous, even for someone as accomplished as James. '
b'Those rankings almost certainly will not improve this year. But among the more interesting aspects of James\xe2\x80\x99s current predicament is the opinion among many Lakers fans that the team\xe2\x80\x99s struggles have resulted in James\xe2\x80\x99s failing to live up to Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. Those criticisms ignore the fact that the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 current six-year run of missing the playoffs included three seasons in which Bryant was still with the team. '
b'In fact, when Bryant passed Jordan on the career scoring list in 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 a feat considered a big enough deal at the time that a road game in Minnesota was stopped for several minutes so the crowd could give him a standing ovation and the Timberwolves\xe2\x80\x99 owner could present him with the game ball \xe2\x80\x94 the Lakers were only 8-16 and, partially a result of a season-ending injury to Bryant later in the year, were on their way to a 21-61 record.'
b'But in one of the endless parallels between the careers of Jordan and James, players who will be debated long after both are gone, Jordan, who passed Wilt Chamberlain for No. 3 on the career scoring list in 2003, also found little joy in what should have been a huge accomplishment, largely because his Washington Wizards were a .500 team at the time. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing about stats is they define you when you\xe2\x80\x99re 10 or 20 years past the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Jordan said when asked to sum up his feelings on the accomplishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile you\xe2\x80\x99re playing, what matters is wins.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'James, who wears No. 23 because of Jordan, put a wristband on his forearm because of Jordan, learned to shoot fadeaways because of Jordan and pitches sneakers for Nike just like Jordan does, may want to heed that advice from Jordan in terms of coming back on his accomplishments later, even if they have to be put aside for now. '
b'The Lakers could never win another game and James, a player who still refuses to label himself a scorer, will always have more points than Jordan, the player who served as his inspiration on a path to greatness. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI gotta carry it on to the next kid,\xe2\x80\x9d James said after the game, finally letting his emotion truly show. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully I can inspire the next kid like myself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"An earlier version of this article misstated the time in the game when LeBron James moved to fourth on the N.B.A.'s career scoring list. It was with 5:38 left in the second quarter, not 5:38 into the second quarter."

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Knicks center Enes Kanter said on Friday that he would not travel with the team to play the Washington Wizards in London on Jan. 17 because he feared retaliation for his public opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.'
b'Kanter, who is Turkish, has been an outspoken critic of the president for years.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSadly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going because of that freaking lunatic, the Turkish president,\xe2\x80\x9d Kanter said after the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 119-112 victory over the Lakers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sad that all the stuff affects my career and basketball because I want to be out there and help my team win. But just because of the one lunatic guy, one maniac, one dictator, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even go out there and do my job. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty sad.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Kanter said Turkish operatives could present a danger to him in London.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have a lot of spies there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could get killed there easy.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'An official at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, speaking Saturday on the condition of anonymity to abide by diplomatic protocol, dismissed Kanter\xe2\x80\x99s comments as baseless.'
b'A Knicks official later said that Kanter would not be traveling to London because of a visa issue.'
b'In May 2017, Kanter was detained for several hours at an airport in Romania after the Turkish government canceled his travel documents. Later that year, Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s state-run news agency reported that prosecutors were seeking more than four years in jail for Kanter on charges that he had insulted Erdogan on social media.'

b'Harden\xe2\x80\x99s 57 points against Memphis accounted for more than half of his team\xe2\x80\x99s total helping make up for his lack of a supporting cast.'
b'By Benjamin Hoffman'
b'No Chris Paul. No Eric Gordon. No Clint Capela. No problem. The Houston Rockets still have James Harden.'
b'In a mind-boggling performance, Harden and his supporting cast \xe2\x80\x94 if you can call it that \xe2\x80\x94 managed to beat the Memphis Grizzlies by 112-94 at Houston\xe2\x80\x99s Toyota Center, with Harden scoring 57 points in 34 minutes.'
b'It was the 17th game in a row in which Harden scored at least 30 points \xe2\x80\x94 a feat previously accomplished in a single season by only Wilt Chamberlain \xe2\x80\x94 and it was Harden\xe2\x80\x99s third game of 50 or more points this season. No other player has more than one.'
b'Coach Mike D\xe2\x80\x99Antoni may have recorded the 600th win of his N.B.A. career in the game, but he was more interested in making sure people recognized the greatness of Harden\xe2\x80\x99s feat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat he just did, we kind of take it for granted a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Antoni told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, look at that, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that cute?\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s 57!\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Harden, however, tried to keep the focus on Houston continuing to climb in the standings, and making up for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Orlando.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was an emotional lift,\xe2\x80\x9d Harden told reporters of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s win, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know it\xe2\x80\x99s crunchtime in the sense that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got three starters out and guys have got to pick up the slack. There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'While the outburst was hardly unexpected for Harden, who is now averaging an N.B.A.-leading 34.8 points a game, the Rockets\xe2\x80\x99 personnel situation made it stand out. Paul has been out with an injured hamstring since Dec. 20 and Gordon has been out with an injured knee since Dec. 29. Houston\xe2\x80\x99s injury report then took on what seemed like a crippling blow earlier on Monday when it was revealed that Capela, the team\xe2\x80\x99s center \xe2\x80\x94 and the most frequent recipient of Harden\xe2\x80\x99s assists \xe2\x80\x94 would be out for four to six weeks as a result of ligament damage in his right thumb.'
b'That list of injuries left Harden starting alongside the forgettable quartet of P.J. Tucker, Nene, Austin Rivers and Danuel House Jr. No matter, as Harden joined Kemba Walker as the only players to score more than half of their team\xe2\x80\x99s points in a game this season.'
b'Harden was hot from the start, setting a Rockets record with 36 points in the first half, and he succeeded all game with his typical combination of 3-pointers (6 for 15) and free-throws (17 for 18). He also led all players in the game with nine rebounds and committed just five turnovers despite his outrageous level of usage.'
b'The last time Harden scored fewer than 30 points was Dec. 11 in Houston\xe2\x80\x99s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, and he just barely missed the feat that night, with 29 points on 10 of 21 shooting. Since then he has averaged 41.3 points a game over the 17 games in which the Rockets, who got off to a poor start this season, have gone 13-4.'
b'In the 17 games, Harden has topped 50 points twice and 40 points 10 times. He has also recorded five triple-doubles.'
b'While Harden\xe2\x80\x99s performance on Monday broke his tie with Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s longest single-season streak of 30-plus points by a player not named Chamberlain, Harden has a long way to go before catching Wilt.'
b'Chamberlain had 30-point streaks, of 20, 25, 31 and 65 games in his career, according to Basketball-Reference.com. The longest one, which came during the 1961-62 season, is likely an unbreakable record, but it comes with an amusing footnote: In Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s last game before the streak started, he was held to 28 points in a loss to Bill Russell\xe2\x80\x99s Boston Celtics. When the streak finally ended more than three months later, Chamberlain was held to 26 points \xe2\x80\x94 in a loss to Russell\xe2\x80\x99s Celtics.'
b'As it currently stands, though, Harden does not appear to have a foil that can be his version of Russell, so there is no telling when this streak will end.'

b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 Vast upheaval within the Los Angeles Lakers organization continued on Friday afternoon when the team announced that Luke Walton was stepping down as coach.'
b'The Lakers said in a statement that Walton and the team had \xe2\x80\x9cmutually agreed to part ways,\xe2\x80\x9d without elaborating. The news came three days after Magic Johnson, the team\xe2\x80\x99s president for basketball operations, made the surprise announcement that he was resigning so he could devote more time to his business interests.'
b'Walton, 39, was in his third season with the Lakers, who were expected to vie for a playoff spot after signing LeBron James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, to a four-year, $154 million contract last July. Instead, the Lakers scuffled to a 37-45 record after months of general dysfunction and momentum-sapping injuries. They finished 10th in the Western Conference, well out of playoff position.'
b'The N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s postseason will start Saturday but without the Lakers, whose postseason drought is now at six seasons. Not even the celebrated addition of James could salvage this one, but he missed significant time with a groin injury. And even when he was on the court, he appeared detached from his teammates as weeks of misery mounted.'
b'The Lakers are fraught with problems. When Johnson announced that he was quitting this week, he indicated that he had been planning to fire Walton and that he had the support of Jeanie Buss, the team\xe2\x80\x99s controlling owner, to go forward with the move. But then Johnson resigned \xe2\x80\x94 in part, he said, because he could not go through with affecting someone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clivelihood.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hours later, after the Lakers had closed out their season with a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, Walton said that he was looking forward to an eventful summer with the team in hopes of making improvements. Now he is gone, too, though he may not be unemployed for long.'
b'The Sacramento Kings immediately responded to Friday\xe2\x80\x99s news by reaching out to Walton\xe2\x80\x99s representatives to arrange an interview for their coaching vacancy, according to two people familiar with Sacramento\xe2\x80\x99s plans who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Walton is considered the front-runner to replace Dave Joerger, whom the Kings fired this week.'
b'Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, expressed his support for Walton, one of his former assistants.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn this job, as a coach in the N.B.A., you are 100 percent dependent on your circumstances: the strength of your organization, the momentum, unity,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr told reporters in Oakland, Calif. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything has to be in good order, because if it\xe2\x80\x99s not, as we have witnessed with the Lakers, then there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be casualties, and usually the coach is the first one.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re losing one of the best humans in the N.B.A. They\xe2\x80\x99re losing a guy who knows the game as well as anybody I\xe2\x80\x99ve met. They\xe2\x80\x99re losing somebody who players believe in.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Walton, the son of the Hall of Fame center Bill Walton, was working with an ill-conceived roster that lacked depth, defense and perimeter shooting. Still, the pressure was on him before the season even began. Once the Lakers got off to a slow start, Johnson chastised Walton in a closed-door meeting, raising speculation that Walton was already on the hot seat.'
b'Questions about Walton\xe2\x80\x99s job security persisted throughout the season as he shuffled rotations and lineups, searching for solutions that never materialized.'
b'Walton refused to make excuses \xe2\x80\x94 publicly, he was a voice of unwavering optimism amid a sea of discontent \xe2\x80\x94 but it hardly helped that the Lakers were troubled by injuries, especially at point guard.'
b'Then there was James, who had been incredibly durable in his 16-year career. But during the Lakers\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas Day game against the Warriors, he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next 17 games. Without him, the Lakers struggled. The hope was that they could regain their footing once he returned, but he was not the cure-all anyone imagined. The Lakers continued to lose with James back in the lineup, even though he said he had \xe2\x80\x9cactivated\xe2\x80\x9d himself for a playoff push.'
b'It had become clear by then, however, that the Lakers did not have any discernible chemistry, especially after Johnson and Rob Pelinka, their general manager, tried and failed to acquire the All-Star center Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans ahead of February\xe2\x80\x99s trade deadline. (It was no coincidence, perhaps, that Davis and James shared an agent, Rich Paul.) The Lakers were willing to send the Pelicans several of their promising young players, including Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball, but were rebuffed in their attempts to swing a blockbuster deal.'
b'The result was a team that seemed distracted at best and fractured at worst. Before long, the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention. James did not dress for the final six games of the season.'
b'Walton, who spent most of his 10-year N.B.A. playing career with the Lakers, winning two championships as a reserve forward, was hired as their coach in 2016 after two seasons as an assistant with the Warriors. In 2015-16, he began the season as the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 interim coach while Kerr recovered from debilitating back issues, and guided the team to a 39-4 record, which included a league-record 24 straight wins to start the season.'
b'It was certainly an achievement, but the Warriors were coming off a championship and primed to excel. With the Lakers, Walton was trying to build something. Now, that vast project \xe2\x80\x94 however onerous \xe2\x80\x94 will continue without him.'

b'And the Oscar goes to \xe2\x80\xa6 the Knicks?'
b'Not quite. But the team \xe2\x80\x94 and its woeful state as one of the worst teams in the N.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 did get a shout out during the Academy Awards on Sunday night.'
b'When Samuel L. Jackson came out with Brie Larson to present the Best Adapted Screenplay award at the Oscars, he had a short preamble, a personal message to Spike Lee, a nominee and a famously devoted Knicks fan through thick and thin.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, Spike, so glad you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting down,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackson began. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter 18 consecutive home losses, the Knicks won tonight. I repeat, the Knicks won tonight, defeated San Antonio, 130-118\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s stats were accurate. The 18-game home losing streak had set a franchise record.'
b'Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s news flash drew a laugh from Lee, and also an exclamation. It was not audible on the broadcast, but just about every armchair lip reader believed he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tank.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'While you might think that the end of a long losing streak would delight a superfan like Lee, there are those Knicks supporters out there who don\xe2\x80\x99t especially want to win many \xe2\x80\x94 or any \xe2\x80\x94 more games.'
b'If the Knicks finish in the bottom three of the N.B.A., they will get the best possible chance, 14 percent, to land the top draft pick in June. A recent injury aside, that is still expected to be the Duke star Zion Williamson. A bottom three finish would also give the Knicks a 40 percent chance at a top three pick.'
b'As of Monday morning, the Knicks stand at 12-48, for the second worst record. Despite their win, they look likely to grab a bottom three spot, probably alongside the Phoenix Suns (11-50) and Cleveland Cavaliers (14-46). But the Chicago Bulls are looming, two games \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d than the Cavs.'
b'The league actually changed the draft lottery percentages this season in an effort to cut down on tanking, particularly after the 76ers went on a multiyear losing period of terrible play that got them several top picks. A year ago, the worst record offered a full 25 percent chance at No. 1, with the second and third worst teams getting 20 and 16 percent chances.'
b'Lee has been the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 consensus No. 1 fan for years, sitting courtside and not infrequently interacting with players on both teams. Perhaps most infamously, in 1994, he jawed with the Pacers\xe2\x80\x99 Reggie Miller in a conference finals game. Miller went on to the lead the Pacers to victory, drawing a \xe2\x80\x9cThanks a Lot Spike\xe2\x80\x9d headline from The New York Daily News.'
b'Jackson and Lee have a history as well, with Jackson appearing in \xe2\x80\x9cDo the Right Thing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSchool Daze,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJungle Fever\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMo Better Blues.\xe2\x80\x9d They are also both alumni of Morehouse College.'
b'In this age of smartphones, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that those at the Oscars who cared already knew the Knicks score, perhaps including Lee.'
b'That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in 1976, when Elliott Gould, presenting the award for best editing, alerted the audience that Indiana had won the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball national championship, 86-68. \xe2\x80\x9cI listened to the score before we went out to make the presentation,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Grantland. \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally in the wings, there was a radio there.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'By the way, along with his co-writers, Lee won on Sunday, his first competitive Oscar. There is no evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\xe2\x80\x9d or the other nominees engaged in any tanking.'
b'An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the actor who presented the Academy Award for best editing in 1976. He is Elliott Gould, not Eliott.'

b'Knicks Coach David Fizdale pulled at the edge of his graying beard as he dissected his team\xe2\x80\x99s latest blowout loss. Leading a team that is now 10-42, the worst record in the N.B.A., Fizdale has had to search hard for traces of sunshine.'
b'As he answered questions from reporters at a recent postgame news conference, the frames of his trademark glasses looked as broken as the franchise itself. The damaged black frames were held together by a glop of glue; Fizdale had cracked them earlier in the season.'
b'It is easy to say now, but with 30 games remaining the Knicks seem to have been lost from the start. They began the season with the youngest roster in the N.B.A., with an average age of less than 24.5 years old. Development became the mantra with Fizdale, who in his first season as the Knicks head coach has frequently referred to his players as \xe2\x80\x9ckids.\xe2\x80\x9d Inexperience, a revolving-door rotation, and the absence of Kristaps Porzingis \xe2\x80\x94 the star forward who has been out injured since February 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 compounded the losing.'
b'Now, after last week\xe2\x80\x99s trade that sent Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks ended any hope that he might return to save the season, the Knicks could be in danger of finishing with the worst record in franchise history. The low mark was a 17-65 record during the 2014-15 season. They have lost 13 in a row, 25 of the last 27 and a franchise-record 14 consecutive games at home. Not surprisingly, they were 27th in the league in offensive rating and 28th in defensive rating entering Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s games.'
b'Of course, Knicks fans have become inured to the losing \xe2\x80\x94 this will be the team\xe2\x80\x99s sixth consecutive season without a winning record. Other than the 2012-13 season, when the Knicks reached the Eastern Conference semifinals, it has been nearly two decades since the team advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs.'
b'Newcomers like Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson and Allonzo Trier may be the future, but injuries and inconsistency have marred the present. Knox, the 6-foot-9 forward chosen ninth over all in last year\xe2\x80\x99s draft, is one of the youngest players in the league, at 19. In December he earned Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month honors, but his 37.1 shooting percentage needs to improve.'
b'The Knicks took a gamble on the 7-foot-1 Robinson when they selected him in the second round of June\xe2\x80\x99s draft, 36th over all. He was the only player in last year\xe2\x80\x99s draft who did not play in college, overseas or in the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s developmental league. Instead, Robinson took a year off from organized basketball after high school to get ready for the draft.'
b'Trier, a 6-foot-5 guard, went undrafted after three seasons at Arizona, but his early impressive play led to a two-year, $7 million deal with the Knicks.'
b'The Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 front office has been lauded for its savvy picks in last year\xe2\x80\x99s draft and its recent acquisition of reclamation projects. That acumen will be tested in June. The Knicks, who own a first-round draft pick, will have the chance to select an impact player with their winning-by-losing approach.'
b'The more they lose, the better their chances are of landing Duke\xe2\x80\x99s Zion Williamson or another highly coveted prospect. Still, it is not a slam dunk \xe2\x80\x94 even if the Knicks fail to win 20 games this year. Being the worst team in the N.B.A. used to provide a greater advantage in the draft lottery. Because the league changed the rule to deter teams from tanking, the bottom three teams now share the same 14 percent odds of winning the No. 1 pick. Previously, the worst team held a 25 percent chance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cObviously, you always want to win. Every game we play we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Fizdale has said.'
b'But what if the Knicks actually did start winning, boosted by the three players acquired in the Porzingis trade with Dallas? The Knicks gained the promising guard Dennis Smith Jr., who was a first-round draft pick in 2017, and the expiring contracts of the veterans DeAndre Jordan and Wesley Matthews, plus two future first-round picks. Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke were shipped to the Mavericks.'
b'The Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 newcomers knew only a few of the team\xe2\x80\x99s offensive plays before making their debut against Memphis on Sunday, with Smith Jr. and Jordan starting. Both made standout plays early. Smith scored his first basket on a drive into the lane with an up-and-under layup and added another in a fast-break opportunity. Jordan registered a block, followed by an alley-oop dunk off an assist from Smith. All this competent basketball made some Knicks fans nervous, leading to some angst-ridden gallows humor on social media.'
b'The Knicks held on for the loss, 96-84.'
b'With Smith and Jordan in the starting lineup, the Knicks have continued their season theme of roster roulette. Fizdale has stitched together 57 five-man lineups that have played 10 or more minutes together this season. But of those groups, only five lineups have played 50 or more minutes together.'
b'Consider center Enes Kanter, who started 23 games but lost his starting job as the team decided to focus on developing its younger players. He did not go quietly to the end of the bench. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go out and do my job and help my team win,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in late December. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re winning, it\xe2\x80\x99s good. But if we\xe2\x80\x99re losing it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. If this adjustment is going to get us a win, cool. But if not, there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'But lately the most vocal cheer at Madison Square Garden has been, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want Kanter!\xe2\x80\x9d as he sits on the bench. After four consecutive games in which he did not play, Kanter entered the game against Dallas last week, went to his knees and kissed the midcourt Garden logo. He explained later that he wanted to show his love for the fans since it could be one of his final games as a Knick, with the trade deadline looming.'
b'In the second quarter against Memphis on Sunday, Fizdale looked down the bench and called for \xe2\x80\x9cDennis,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the newly acquired point guard Dennis Smith Jr. Kanter, however, heard \xe2\x80\x9cEnes\xe2\x80\x9d and started for the scorer\xe2\x80\x99s table until he was stopped by the assistant coach Keith Smart.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to run all the way to the scorer\xe2\x80\x99s table, make it a bigger spectacle,\xe2\x80\x9d Fizdale said. But the damage, as it is with the Knicks, was already done.'
