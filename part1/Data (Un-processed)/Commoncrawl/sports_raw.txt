We're only a few days away from the first week of the inaugural Alliance of American Football season (which will be broadcast on CBS, by the way). Westgate SuperBook has already set odds for this year's champion, so why not set some win totals while we're at it?
BetDSI has released regular-season win totals for all eight teams, and not surprisingly, there's a lot of projected parity for an alliance that has yet to play a single game (check out our Power Rankings here). For example: the Arizona Hotshots, who are favored by Westgate to win the AAF championship, have the highest win total of 6.5 with slightly more risk on the under. The Birmingham Iron, at 3.5, have the lowest projected win total. 
Here are the full win totals for the 10-game regular season ... 
Arizona Hotshots: 6.5Over 6.5 (-110)Under 6.5 (-120)
Orlando Apollos: 6Over 6 (-115)Under 6 (-115)
San Antonio Commanders: 5.5Over 5.5 (-130)Under 5.5 (+100)

A.J. Tarpley is used to chaos. Through preparation and repetition, it's what football teaches you to deal with. The San Diego Fleet linebacker played football at the highest levels, both for the Stanford Cardinal in college from 2012-15, and then with Buffalo Bills for one year. And for two years as a sales rep on Wall Street in New York City, he lived in the chaos. 
Tarpley would head downtown, day after day, to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, where he worked the desk for distressed debts. He specialized in trading distressed bonds, leverage loans, equities and the like. Back-to-back with other reps, he's spend all day yelling and trading, one voice in the sea of the madness.
"But it was a trading floor," he said, implying what would be in the mind's eye when someone thinks of Wall Street. "It was that atmosphere." 
Tarpley got into Wall Street through -- how else? -- connections. Being a Stanford alum helps, and Tarpley was introduced to the bullpen through former Cardinal offensive tackle Chris Marinelli, who, according to his LinkedIn profile, now works as the Director of Interest Rate Sales and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
"The people I worked with were awesome. I learned a ton of stuff. You know not only in that distress bond market, but I learned a ton of stuff about finance," Tarpley said. "My boss played football at Harvard. The other guy I sat next to was 36. He was in the Marines for seven years. So there were some awesome guys who took me under their wings and you know that makes it as easy as anything, when you're working any job." 
The brotherhood on Wall Street, Tarpley found, was not too dissimilar from the brotherhood of a football locker room. There were former athletes of almost every walk of life: basketball players, soccer players, lacrosse players. They'd work out together before or after work. It was almost like playing football all over again, and the Wall Street bullpen was akin to Saturdays and Sundays in the fall. The pandemonium would be palpable and Tarpley would have to make decisions quickly, but accurately. 
"You're right next to each other elbow to elbow. You try and be good at making split-second decisions or being cool under pressure. Tarpley said. "I know it sounds cheesy for a little bit, but there are a lot of student athletes or former student athletes out there." 
Tarpley found comfort in this new "sport" because he had just gotten out of another. In 2016, he was in an NFL locker room with the Buffalo Bills, finishing up his rookie season. He was on a three-year contract and his last play -- ever, as it turned out -- was a game-sealing interception against Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Jets. Tarpley's effort actually knocked their divisional their AFC foe out of playoff contention. 
But in April of that year, following some time back in California, he announced in a Sports Illustrated story -- "Why I walked away from football at 23" -- that he was retiring from the game for good. 
Tarpley revealed that he had suffered his third and fourth concussions since high school during the past season. The third one came the previous summer during his rookie training camp. Meeting a fullback in the gap, Tarpley suffered a blow to the helmet by way of the other player's facemask.
"I went through the rest of practice with a headache and tunnel vision, and then went to the trainers after practice and asked them to check me out," Tarpley wrote. "I passed balance, vision and memory tests, and once I realized my memory was fine, I didn't press the issue."
The symptoms didn't go away; they intensified.
"For the next few days I had a raging headache. I drank several liters of Pedialyte and gallons of water trying to convince myself that dehydration was the cause," he wrote. "I knew that if I told the trainers about my headache persisting then I would have to be reevaluated and risk missing practice or even game time."
Tarpley's fourth concussion came during a 34-31 loss to Jacksonville in London on Oct. 25. After initially refusing to leave the field, Tarpley took himself out of the game and went to the locker room. He recalled vision problems, migraines, nausea, and numbness in his right arm. Two weeks later following an open week, though, he was back at it. As an unsigned free agent rookie, he knew playing time was at a premium and could be cut at any time. (He was, in fact, briefly cut and sent to the practice squad for a week in November before being reactivated to the 53-man roster.) 
But at some point in their lives, every athlete will be told they can no longer play the sport they love. Having faced multiple concussions -- and these were on top of all the additional sprains, bruises and fractures he played with over the years -- Tarpley didn't want that to happen, so he made the decision for himself. He went into then-coach Rex Ryan's office, called it quits, and took up Wall Street. 
The decision was significant, to say the least. The NFL has battled a well-documented PR war when it comes to player safety -- concussions, namely. That one of its members would willingly give up everything after one season in the name of his own well-being was a sobering moment. 
Still, science, physics and reason don't always mix with passion. Fast forward to 2018, and Tarpley, now firmly entrenched on Wall Street, had an unsettled feeling. They call it the two-year itch: when a player or coach takes time away from the game, only to realize about two years later they might have something more to give.
Tarpley had been playing football since before he was 10 years old. At the time of his retirement, he didn't feel like playing football anymore. As time went on and distance grew between him and the game, however, Tarpley knew that his window was closing if he wanted to go back.
"As a football player you can only be away from the game so long before you won't get another chance," he said. 
That June, he quit his Wall Street job and began training for a return to football. He went from working out for two hours a day, five or six days a week to making it a full-time job, hoping that someone in the NFL would give him a shot. While that never came, he did get the call to join the Fleet in the AAF. Tarpley was back in familiar territory: the locker room. The atmosphere, he said, is what he missed the most. 
"There's no other place in the real world where you can go play football, right? You can go play pickup basketball. You can go play in a softball league," he explained. "But, you never are gonna step into a huddle and call a play and then communicate with a group of guys like in football.
"So that's been the most fun for me, just getting back into that. You form these bonds with these guys. Everyone has a different story. Some guys are 21, some guys are 30. Every kind of imaginable story in between. Just getting to know them and getting to work with them and you know be a team. Go for that one goal."
Tarpley's name was frequently mentioned by those around the Fleet as one the best on the team coming out of training camp in January. He made the final cut for this season's roster and has already been named team captain with four tackles in two games. 
"He's one of those guys who does everything well," said coach Mike Martz. "His tackling, his run fits, his coverage. ... I did know a little about his time on Wall Street. But I also know he's a great football player. We're really happy to have him." 
Tarpley gave up football once for reasons that were personal, but also completely understandable. Nothing in this life is linear, and in evaluating whether he would come back to football, Tarpley weighed his struggle with concussions heavily.
"At the end of the day," he said, "it was just risk verse reward at that time."
But he also knew he fought once to make it on a professional football team and succeeded. Maybe he could do it again. Like many other players in the AAF, another shot at the NFL remains a goal of his. For now, though, he's happy to be back playing football. Against the San Antonio Commanders in Week 3, Tarpley showed he still had it with an impressive pick-six. 
Take it to the house, @AJTarpley! 6⃣🙌#SDFleet lead the @aafcommanders 14-8 in the 2nd quarter. #AllHandsOnDeck pic.twitter.com/aRKmTt1tVh
"I didn't wait for somebody to say, 'Hey, you can't play a sport anymore,' right? Because that does happen to some people, whether it be their leg, their head, whatever it is. I walked away on my own terms. And that allowed me to come back," he said. "So in a weird way it's kind of a full circle. But, I told myself that if I woke up still wanting to play football every day -- a year from now, two years from now -- then I owe it to myself to go do that."
In his retirement article, Tarpley finished by writing, "Going forward my life will be entirely what I make of it. My happiness is in my hands." As he comes back to football, to the chaos, the same principle still applies.

It's easy to think of the Alliance of American Football as a pro sports league because, well, it is. But at its heart it's a start-up. It's a business. And like any business, there are things it does well and areas where it falls short. 
Even though the AAF existed long before its football season kicked off two weeks ago, CEO Charlie Ebersol is going to learn a lot about how to make his product better over the next three months as the inaugural season unfolds. As a single entity, the AAF can make decisions quickly that will affect how it operates moving forward. 
After two weekends of games, we already have information rolling in helping us decide what we love, and what we don't love, about the AAF. Think of the following list as a Yelp! review for the AAF as it continues to roll out spring football. Here are five things I've loved -- and not loved -- about the Alliance. 
The AAF is about giving players another chance to excel at football. For most of them, that second (or third?) chance is with the NFL; for others, it's about squeezing out the last little bit of football they have left in them. Regardless of the background, everyone in the AAF has a story. Yes, Luis Perez's story is fascinating, but he's not the only one. Trent Richardson's story is inspiring, as are the three female coaches in the Alliance. Getting to know the names that make up the AAF is part of the appeal. 
Offense sells, so it's totally within reason that the AAF would limit blitzing to five players within a box on passing situations. (Pro Football Talk explains the rules in further detail.) And given that the defenses are ahead of the offenses coming out of training camp, call the rules a handicap. Still, the offenses aren't being asked to play with one hand behind their backs, why should defenses? There are offensive plays that can counter a blitz. Coaches can install that part of their offense without overwhelming the players with too much information. Let both sides play uninhibited. 
I dove further into this, but I'm a huge fan of peeling back the curtain on instant replay. I'd be so bold as to say it is the best thing the AAF does on game day. Keeping fans engaged is important and replay is traditionally a period of the game when it becomes easy to disengage. The replay officials are still human, and thus they'll still make calls people don't agree with or in some instances be flat-out wrong, but the transparency is refreshing.

Christopher Walken needed more cowbell like I need more SkyJudge. The ninth member of the AAF's game-day officiating crew is an all-seeing, almost omnipresent set of eyes designed to overturn "obvious and egregious" officiating errors. Well, through two weeks, there have been some obvious and egregious officiating errors. And, yet, I haven't heard much from the SkyJudge, namely on some pass interference penalties that should never have been overturned. I get that the AAF wants to keep the flow of the game going as efficiently as possible, but there's also a balance of getting calls right. 
Sunday's 37-29 thriller between Orlando and San Antonio was all the things the AAF should be: high-scoring -- at least by comparison -- with momentum swings, standout individual performances and a raucous home crowd to boot. If you missed it, you missed the best game of the first two weeks (and maybe of the season). They even had a large human being touchdown. That was the vision of the AAF realized. Not every game is going to have that level of hype and drama, but if the product is really going to be as good as Charlie Ebersol and Bill Polian have promised, then more will have to resemble it.

Look, it would be foolhardy to expect a finished product after two weeks. It might be foolhardy to expect a finished product ever. This league is for player development and so you're going to get football that isn't as sharp as what you see in the NFL. However, the dropped passes have been frustrating -- almost infuriating, even. Birmingham has been singled out on here before, but by no means are they the only offender. Timing routes take, um, time to develop, but there have been a noticeable amount of yards and points left on the field. 
Every sport needs a personality. Not a villain, per se, but someone to stir things up a bit. Orlando Apollos coach Steve Spurrier is that person for the AAF, and thank the heavens he's here. The AAF is not the NFL. It doesn't need to be as buttoned up as the NFL. Putting microphones on players and coaches isn't new, but when you mic up Spurrier, good things are bound to happen.

"Tell him to catch it this time." Some sound advice from Steve Spurrier. 😂 pic.twitter.com/sNI09aadlW
The fact that the bottom four teams -- Atlanta, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego -- are averaging fewer than 16 points per game isn't solely the fault of quarterback play. Most quarterbacks are as good as their protection allows them to be. However, it's no coincidence that the four aforementioned teams have question marks at quarterback -- which, fine, not everyone's going to have the next Kurt Warner. Injuries, as is the case with the Salt Lake Stallions, play a role, too. Moving forward, though, the AAF needs to take a long look at how it selects and develops quarterbacks. Maybe that means adjusting schemes to fit their talents; so much of what football runs flows upwards anyway. Or maybe that means finding ways to get true No. 2 guys in the NFL to come and get reps. It'll be one of the strongest offseason storylines for the interest in this league. 
The AAF gets highlights out on Twitter pretty quickly and game clips are easy to find on YouTube. That makes digesting the most interesting parts of the game easy. The AAF app is also remarkable in that it allows fans to follow the action of the players on the field in real time (not a #sponsored blurb, I swear). In terms of covering its own games, the AAF is accessible with its content. That's a huge plus for a company that doesn't button itself up like some other pro leagues. 
The AAF finally has a team-by-team stats page on its website. It's helpful if you want to know raw data after the fact, but as a supposedly more tech-savvy football league, it's been a little slow getting real-time stats uploaded to a central, official location. All the stats are compiled after the games. Furthermore, while relying on sites like Pro Football Focus for advanced analytics is good, it'd be nice if the AAF had a similar service to help with matchup breakdowns and fantasy football. You can certainly find those numbers if you dig on your own, but that's a service that's missing.

Observing Steve Spurrier in his natural element deserved the David Attenborough treatment. 
On the football fields of San Antonio in central Texas, a Spurrier has emerged from the winter months. He stands with his arms crossed, observing the swarming chaos around him. At 73 years old, a Spurrier can continue coaching for years beyond similar species. Research scientists have concluded Spurrier's wit and intelligence are amongst the highest of his kind found anywhere in the world.

Indeed, the "Head Ball Coach" looked completely at ease overlooking practice at the home stadium for the University of Incarnate Word in San Antonio. It was training camp time for the Alliance of American Football and the Orlando Apollos are largely considered to be one of the top contenders in the new eight-team league. The sun was out, the temperature was mild and pads were clacking. It all felt so right. 
Then, the feeling was officially corroborated. After the final horn blew, Spurrier walked up to the Apollos' in-house video crew for a quick interview. With his sunglasses and ball cap on, he made a sucking sound with his teeth and uttered a signature "Waylp." 
Yep, Steve Spurrier was back where he belonged. 
"I think it's pretty normal," he opined about the day's practice. "It's what I'm used to." 
Spurrier is here to begin with because he succumbed to what he calls the "two-year itch." It's a condition that affects retired coaches and players alike. Spurrier got that itch about a year-and-a-half ago. He's been serving as an ambassador at Florida, his alma mater, where he won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback in 1966. And, yet, he found himself still engaged with the evolution of football, particularly on offense. 
"The game has changed in three years," he said, "just with the ball, guys in motion, the zone reads, throwing it all over the place, the RPOs. If there was real good ball play, shoot, I'd go jot it down somewhere and then put it on another sheet when I got home. I'm always looking for a new ball play, a good new ball play.
"When I was sitting up in the press box watching a bunch of teams play, [I thought] if I could coach offense for some of these guys, maybe I should be doing it," he added. "And then this opportunity come up. But without this opportunity, I doubt if I would have been a coach."
Spurrier got an initial call from Arizona Hotshots coach Rick Neuheisel last March, followed by another call -- this time, an offer -- from his former Tampa Bay Buccaneers teammate J.K. McKay, the AAF's Head of Football Operations. The new league wanted Spurrier to coach Orlando, which he happily accepted. Orlando, only a two-hour drive from Gainesville, fits Spurrier and his family well. His wife, Jerri, enjoys being back amongst the players. For Spurrier, the chance to call plays again -- in addition to his head-coaching duties, Spurrier is the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach -- and develop players for only five months out of the year was just long enough to stay busy without dedicating too much time to it. 
You see, this is retirement for Spurrier. He remains active with Florida, coaches a little ball in the spring and plays a round of golf with a cooler of Coors in his downtime. 
To understand why this combination works for him, you need to understand first why he got out of the game to begin with. Spurrier left, abruptly, more than three years ago in the middle of a sagging season at South Carolina. The Gamecocks were 2-4 and a resounding 0-for in the SEC. In up and leaving, Spurrier was literally the "Well ... bye" meme. 
Spurrier had built South Carolina, his third collegiate coaching stop after Duke and Florida, where he had also won, into a legitimate SEC East contender, winning a divisional title in 2010 followed by three consecutive 11-win seasons. However, the program was in a bad place by 2015, so Spurrier quit. There's a legitimate criticism in how Spurrier left; call it abandonment if you will. Then again, Spurrier has never cared about your criticism, and if nothing else, he was at least transparent after the fact and donated his $3 million buyout. 
Spurrier's exit was extremely on-brand, too. The HBC has never believed, and will never believe, that football is anything more than what it is: a game. He did not abide by the commonly-held coaching practice that working tirelessly longer hours somehow meant working harder or smarter. While he was an excellent recruiter, pulling in in-state blue-chip talent like running back Marcus Lattimore and defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, it was obvious that toward the end that recruiting was lacking. The truth is Spurrier had been contemplating retirement since 2014. He admitted to making a mistake by coming back for another season, so he left without wasting another minute of others contemplating his future on his behalf. 
Spurrier doesn't have to recruit anymore. He also doesn't have to deal with the politics or structure of coaching in the NFL, which he did, unsuccessfully, for two seasons with Washington in 2002 and '03. In the AAF, Spurrier has found a sweet spot of player development and play-calling with none of the side effects. 
Perhaps no player has noticed Spurrier's second wind more than Apollos quarterback Garrett Gilbert. The former Gatorade High School Football Player of the Year in 2008 has had a journeyman's career, from Texas and SMU in college, to five teams in five years in the NFL. As such, he's been around every type of quarterbacks coach you can imagine, from Arkansas' Chad Morris (then the coach at Austin's Lake Travis High School), to June Jones and Josh McDaniels. 
With Spurrier leading the way and Gilbert at QB, the Apollos have the second-best odds to win the AAF behind only the Arizona Hotshots (and they're also second in our Power Rankings).
In Spurrier, Gilbert finds a sharp tactician who hasn't missed a step."He's been real big on our eyes, for all of us, just making sure you're not staring guys down, working your eyes through your progression, holding guys to make certain throws. So that's one thing," Gilbert said. "And for me, personally, just always working on your feet. Your feet drive everything. So that's physically what we're working on. 
"As far as our system's concerned, the mental part of it, we've got most of our stuff in. Now it's just a matter of mastering it. Everything's expedited with this whole league as far as, we had three days of mini camp, now we're in training camp. And you're looking at a game in less than three weeks now." 
Oh, and yes, Spurrier still has those one-liners. 
"He's got a good dry little sense of humor and keeps us on our toes," Gilbert said. "The receivers especially enjoy that whenever he kind of gets onto one of them."
Spurrier is having fun because he knows this is it. He has three or four years left of coaching, maybe five if he's lucky. "Health always plays a key to all of it," he said. There will be a day when Spurrier is done. He'll probably be the one to decide when that day is. And when he's done, he's done. Until then, like so many other players and coaches around the alliance, he's trying to squeeze out all of the football he has left in him. 
On a practice field, surrounded by those who, like him, are looking for another chance, one thing was clear: Spurrier belonged.

Since Week 1, I've been a firm believer that the best football is yet to come in the AAF. I don't believe it's any coincidence that Week 5, the midway point, produced the most exciting results to date. As such, the final five regular-season weeks should have far more in store. 
With that anticipation comes questions. Will the offenses continue to improve? Will quarterback changes pay off? Will anyone sign Johnny Manziel? From these storylines and more, I dove into five topics that I'd like to see answered between now and mid-April. With five more weeks until the playoffs begin, here are five burning questions I look forward to seeing answered. 
AAF teams are scoring more points on average now than they were at the start of the season. That much is indisputable. And it makes sense, too. These teams formed in January, so it's only natural that the defenses would generally be ahead of the offenses. Offensive lines needed time to develop and not every quarterback situation was figured out until three or four (and in some cases, five) weeks in. But as you can see from the table below, overall points have gone up through the first half of the year. This is especially true for losing teams, indicating that games are more competitive now. Indeed, the average margin of victory in Week 1 was about 21 points as opposed to about 6 points in Week 5. 
Week 1
8.5
29.8
38.3
Week 2
17
23.3
40.3
Week 3
13.8
25.8
39.5
Week 4
14
18
32
Week 5
21.8
27.5
48.5
Finally, more points are being scored and games have been more competitive. However, the one area in which offenses still lag is the red zone. Bill Polian, the AAF's Head of Football, said in a recent conference call that red zone offenses (and wide receiver drops, but that's another issue) were the final piece of the puzzle to the higher-scoring games fans thought they'd get when the league began, and he's not wrong. 
Take Orlando, for example. The Apollos have the best offense in the Alliance to the point where it noticeably skews some of the numbers in the table above. And yet, since Week 2, they have never had more than 50 percent efficiency in the red zone. In fact, in their last game, a 31-14 win at Birmingham, the Apollos were 1-of-4 in the red zone and 0-for-2 in goal-to-go situations. This is Orlando we're talking about here. 
But it's not just the Apollos. The San Antonio Commanders are third in total points, but were 2-of-5 in the red zone against the Hotshots in Week 5 and posted similar numbers against the Iron and Apollos. Granted, those are the top two defenses in the AAF. Nobody's scoring on them. But that's kind of the point: Moving the ball hasn't been an issue. Five of the eight teams are averaging more than 300 yards per game. However, only three (Orlando, Arizona and San Diego) average more than 20 points per game -- and that includes non-offensive scores. Look at the numbers for kickers, too: of the four who have made at least 10 field goals so far, 75 percent have been 39 yards or shorter. 
The games have been more entertaining lately, but to fully realize what the AAF could be, red zone offenses have to be better. 
The last I (or anyone else) heard on this, at least publicly, Head of Football Bill Polian explained that the vetting process for Manziel was about 50 percent complete. If the AAF were to acquire him, and he were to join, he'd be allocated to the San Antonio Commanders. That doesn't mean he would necessarily end up there, though. 
Here's my read on the situation: it's far from a sure thing. We still don't know publicly why Manziel was booted from the CFL, but seeing as it's a talent source for the AAF, that detail is kind of important. Keep in mind, too, that AAF coaches, GMs, and front office personnel frequently boast about a labor pool that works hard and stays out of trouble because they know this might be their last chance to either re-enter the NFL -- or play professional football at all. Since leaving Texas A&M, Manziel hasn't been able to keep his nose clean. That's not to say he couldn't find the right situation and turn things around; that would be quite a success story if he did, but history says otherwise. This wouldn't be like trying to sign Colin Kaepernick. 
Consider, too, that the AAF is still in its inaugural season. If Manziel hasn't turned a corner -- to be clear, that's an important element in this, both on a personal and professional level -- what kind of message does that send to the other AAF players if he joins a team? There are projects and then there's going off-brand. 
In a way, yes, Manziel adds a household name to a league that doesn't have much star power. Someone could sign him and cut him loose at the first sign of trouble. But think of it this way: the biggest names in the AAF from Week 1 were the biggest names to begin with because they didn't work out in the NFL. Not only does Manziel fit that description, he was told never to come back to the CFL. Is that what the AAF wants?
Weekly power rankings have become an exercise in the hysterical. The formula is as follows: No. 1: Apollos, No. 2: who didn't completely screw up this week, Nos. 3-8: a game of 52 pickup. In some ways, the parity around the league is a good thing. It makes the playoff race in the second half of the season more interesting, particularly in the West division, where all four teams still have a legitimate shot of making the top two. 
Still, Orlando feels like a sure thing to make the playoffs and, probably, win the whole thing. While it's fun to watch a team execute at high levels, there's no drama if no one else poses a threat. San Antonio came the closest and the only other scenario in which they'd meet again is in the championship game in Las Vegas (which is certainly possible). 
Orlando's remaining schedule is interesting, but keep in mind this team is winning by a league-best 14.4 points per game. Week 6 at home vs. Arizona could be fun in the sense that the Hotshots are capable of stretching the field with receiver Rashad Ross. Arizona may have lost three in a row, but when they turn it on, they're potent. That game is followed by back-to-back road matchups against divisional opponents Atlanta and Memphis. The Legends are more dangerous with quarterback Aaron Murray, who did not face the Apollos in Week 1, and the Express gave Orlando a test with Zach Mettenberger coming off the bench. 
The final two games -- at home against San Diego and Birmingham -- pits the Apollos against the other two best defenses, though Orlando just hung 31 on the Iron in Week 5. Still, Keith Price gave Orlando problems with his legs. And would Philip Nelson be back from his clavicle injury for the Fleet in Week 9? The potential to cut the Apollos just to confirm they have human blood is there, but this team has answered every challenge with exceptional football. 
I mentioned star power above -- or, the lack thereof -- and Richardson is as close to a name brand as there is in this league. Through five games, he leads the Alliance with eight rushing touchdowns. That's good. However, he still averages 2.41 yards per carry, 36.2 yards per game, has a season-long rush of just 10 yards and has eight carries each in the past two games (both losses). That's bad. In fact, those numbers are the worst among running backs with at least three touchdowns. None of them help the narrative of Richardson's career arc. 
Richardson's game is enigmatic. He's the best short-yardage/goal-line back in the Alliance, capable of getting two or three hard-earned yards, all after contact, for a much-needed first down or a touchdown. That still makes him a viable fantasy football option. He's also been an option out of the backfield, leading the Iron with 19 catches. And he's actually shown more wiggle in the open field as a receiver than as a running back. 
In Richardson's defense, he hasn't had a lot of help from his offensive line and the lack of a deep passing attack -- at least until quarterback Keith Price came off the bench in Week 5 vs. Orlando -- allowed defenses to stack the box. If Price opens up the top of the defense, that may at least give Richardson a little more room to operate, though he's still at the mercy of his offensive line. Richardson's vision and decision-making have been weaknesses at times, but there's no denying he's putting up numbers in situations where most offenses around the Alliance have struggled. If the rest of his game opens up, he'll easily get another look from the NFL. 
Barring an injury to, say, Garrett Gilbert, Orlando seems like a lock to make the playoffs. But now that Atlanta, Birmingham and Memphis have changed quarterbacks, the East race is a little more open for that second spot. At 0-3 in the division and 1-4 overall, the Express have the most work to do, but at least Zach Mettenberger has made them more competitive. Seven points and a game-winning field goal is all that separates this team from being 3-0 since Mettenberger came off the bench in Week 3. His 8.8 yards per attempt, 5.6 touchdown percentage and 105.1 passer rating all rank second in the Alliance. 
Since switching to Aaron Murray, the Legends are 2-0. Murray is averaging 313.5 yards per game in that span, with his first passing touchdown coming in Week 5. For context, Atlanta was averaging 264.3 yards per game through the first three weeks. Coming off the bench for Luis Perez in Week 5, Keith Price gave the Iron's offense life with 248 yards of total offense and the first passing touchdown for that team all season. 
Three games in the next five weeks feature the aforementioned three teams playing against one another. Orlando may have a firm grip on the East crown, but that second playoff spot is still anyone's to grab if these three quarterbacks keep elevating the offenses.

The Alliance of American Football announced on Tuesday that it received a $250 million cash investment from Carolina Hurricanes owner/CEO Tom Dundon, which comes after Week 2 of its inaugural season. Dundon, who had been previously introduced to AAF CEO and co-founder Charlie Ebersol, had been monitoring the progress of the AAF before committing to being an investor. 
"Every start-up is in a position to benefit from more capital," an AAF spokesperson told CBS Sports.
"Since the beginning, it has been crucial that the foundation of the Alliance be set with world-class partners and Tom Dundon represents just that," Ebersol said in a statement obtained by CBS Sports. "Tom, Bill Polian, and I will work with our great team at the Alliance to expand our football operations and technology business. Tom is a self-made American success story who brings a wealth of knowledge in the sports, entertainment and finance worlds and proven leadership to our organization."
Dundon will also serve as chairman of the AAF board of directors moving forward. 
"As a lifelong sports fan and entrepreneur, I've always valued the opportunities generated in the ecosystem of sports and entertainment," said Dundon. "I'm impressed with the Alliance's stunning growth in-stadium and across TV, mobile and social media in just these first few weeks."
The Athletic previously reported that Dundon's investment came as the AAF was "running short on cash, and quickly." However, a spokesperson for the AAF told CBS Sports that the announced investment was planned, and that the Athletic's report that some players did not receive their paychecks on time ahead of Week 2 was due to a glitch in moving to a new payroll system. The AAF asserted that no one was in danger of not being paid. 
"The two events are not related," one AAF GM said. "I've been told Tom Dundon reached out to be an investor earlier in the [last] week. We were made aware of the potential payroll issue early Friday morning. Every player in the Alliance was made aware of the issue and the expected resolution today [Tuesday]. We switched payroll companies late January/early February and there was a glitch with the transfer." 
The $250 million investment hits what the spokesperson referred to as a milestone in getting more capital for the start-up football league. Ebersol told the Associated Press on Tuesday that the AAF will not be seeking new investors at this time. "We won't bring in anybody for capital. We're not going to take people's money," he said. "We have to decide who are the partners we want to be in business with. The Alliance already has great relationships with partners such as MGM (Resorts). There won't be any money-raising. It will be growing the business." 
Ebersol told CBS Sports in January that a key challenge for the Alliance was the lack of infrastructure from the start, whereas when Dick Ebersol, Charlie's father, helped launch the XFL 2001, that infrastructure with NBC Universal and General Electric was already in place.

The new Alliance of American Football features just eight teams, so they'll play one another multiple times during the 10-game AAF schedule. Week 3 brings two rematches already, with the Arizona Hotshots (-4.5 in the latest AAF odds) visiting the Salt Lake Stallions on Saturday and the San Diego Fleet (-2.5) hosting the San Antonio Commanders on Sunday. Arizona beat Salt Lake 38-22 in the season opener, while San Antonio handled San Diego, 15-6. Now, the Week 1 winners are on the road in a league where home field advantage has been critical. Home teams have won six of the eight AAF games played thus far. If you really want to cash in big on Week 3 of the AAF, check out what SportsLine's No. 1 pro football expert, R.J. White, has to say. He's studied the latest AAF odds and just locked in his Week 3 AAF picks.
Over the last two years, $100 bettors who have followed White's NFL pointspread picks are up nearly $3,000. In Super Bowl LIII, White was all over the Patriots, nailing the year's biggest sporting event for the legions that follow him. White said he wouldn't trust Rams QB Jared Goff in a big spot -- and Goff's bumbling performance was key to New England's 13-3 win. 
This is the same expert who cashed huge in two of the last four Las Vegas SuperContests. Now, after digesting two weeks of action in the AAF, White is ready to pounce. He locked in AAF picks against-the-spread for all four games -- and if you parlay them, you'd be looking at a strong 10-1 payout. 
We can tell you White is all over the Birmingham Iron (-6.5) as they visit the 0-2 Atlanta Legends on Sunday. While this is 2-0 Birmingham's first road game, good defense travels well. 
"The Iron have the best defense in the AAF right now, especially against the pass," White told SportsLine. "They've allowed just 105 and 99 passing yards in their first two games while giving up a league-low nine points. The Legends played better last week but still not all that well, and they don't have the run game to take the pressure off quarterback Matt Simms in this matchup." 
In the first AAF game of the season, Simms was uninspiring, completing 15 of 28 passes for 126 yards and two picks. Last week, he was marginally better, completing 17 of 25 passes for 160 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.
White also has strong picks for Hotshots vs. Stallions, Express vs. Apollos, and Fleet vs. Commanders. He's also including a bonus best bet on one of the Over-Unders. You can only see his AAF picks and optimal parlay at SportsLine.

Week 3 of the inaugural Alliance of American Football season continues on Sunday with two games. The Birmingham Iron are 6.5-point favorites on the road against the Atlanta Legends, and the total in that game is 40. Meanwhile on the West Coast, the San Diego Fleet will host the San Antonio Commanders in a rematch of a defensive slugfest from Week 1. The Commanders won that game 15-6, but the Fleet are 2.5-point favorites at home on Sunday, with the total at 43.5 in the latest Week 3 AAF odds. Before you make your Week 3 AAF picks for Sunday's two games, you'll want to check out the Week 3 AAF predictions from SportsLine's No. 1 pro football handicapper, R.J. White. 
Over the past two years, $100 bettors who have followed White's NFL point-spread picks are up nearly $3,000. In the 2019 Super Bowl, White was all over the Patriots to cover, nailing the year's biggest sporting event for the legions that follow him. White said he wouldn't trust Rams QB Jared Goff in a big spot -- and Goff's bumbling performance was key to New England's 13-3 win.  
This is the same expert who cashed huge in the Las Vegas SuperContest two of the last four years. Now, after digesting two weeks of action in the AAF, White is ready to pounce. He has locked in AAF picks against-the-spread for every game over at SportsLine.  
We can tell you White is taking the Under for Fleet vs. Commanders at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday. He knows the first time these two teams met back in Week 1 in San Antonio, the Commanders came away with a 15-6 victory that barely cracked 20 points. And while both sides looked better offensively last week, a total that more than doubles their output from the first matchup looks highly suspect.
The two teams combined to turn the ball over five times in the first meeting, and neither team's quarterback has been particularly efficient so far this season. Commanders QB Logan Woodside is only completing 50.7 percent of his passes and averaging 6.4 yards per attempt, while Phillip Nelson is completing 47.5 percent of his passes and averaging 5.3 yards per attempt.
White also has strong against the spread picks for both Sunday games on the Week 3 AAF schedule, and has identified an x-factor that makes one spread way off. He's only sharing what it is, and who to back, at SportsLine.

It's good to have Steve Spurrier coaching again. 
Back in January during training camp, he mentioned a recent encounter he had with now-retired Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, who was at a coach's convention in the area. As they caught up on old times, Spurrier couldn't help notice how at-ease Meyer seemed. 
"He looks really good. He is happy and content," Spurrier said, before adding, "I told him wait 'till you're out about two years, though, and we'll see how happy you're going to be." 
Spurrier called it the two-year itch. And, sure enough, about two years after retiring from coaching at South Carolina, Spurrier got the itch to get back into coaching again. That's when the Orlando Apollos offered him a position he couldn't pass up. It was a chance to call plays again in a familiar area not too far from Gainesville, where he's still an ambassador at his alma mater, the University of Florida. 
Two games into the AAF's first season, it's easy to see that Spurrier still has it -- both as a play-caller and as a thrower of maximum shade. Not only does Orlando have the No. 1 scoring offense in the Alliance, Spurrier's wit remains as sharp as ever. Following the Apollos' thrilling 37-29 win at San Antonio, Spurrier was asked what he thought of the Alamodome crowd noise. His answer: 
Spurrier claims the San Antonio Commanders crowd today was louder than Rocky Top ever was. Head Ball Coach still trolling after all these years. Legend. pic.twitter.com/Mv8u5bc4Dz
The Apollos should in every right be No. 1 in this week's power rankings based on that answer alone, but we're trying to run a legitimate operation here. Yes, Orlando is your new No. 1 team in the AAF, but it's earned that recognition. It wasn't a terribly difficult call, either. After No. 1, though, is where things get interesting. 
Check out this week's power rankings below to see how the rest of the AAF shakes out.
Let's go beyond the 37-29 win at San Antonio. Points and offensive explosiveness have been at a premium, so their value is higher. No team is valued more than the Apollos, who lead the AAF with 38.5 points per game. The scoring isn't solely from the offense -- Orlando has a pair of pick-sixes as well -- but that's what stands out. Quarterback Garrett Gilbert has gone from career journeyman to one of the Alliance's standout players, no doubt because of the work of coach Steve Spurrier. Gilbert has weapons around him, too. This offense is already clicking on a level that most others aren't, which gives them the inside edge towards a championship run. Previously: No. 2

Coupled with Orlando's big win, Arizona's 20-18 escape at Memphis knocks the Hotshots down a spot. Rick Neuheisel's team could still be the one to beat in the West division, but the first half of Saturday's road game brought them down to Earth just a bit. Five turnovers, including two failed fourth-down attempts, will do that. Credit Memphis' defense for circling the wagons and playing lights out for most of the game, but the Hotshots also showed they're still one of the most prolific offenses in the Alliance. When they absolutely needed points, Arizona scored two touchdowns on consecutive drives spanning an average of 81 yards in under five minutes. That's worth something. Previously: No. 1
Finally, controversy. Wins and losses matter, of course, but the Commanders had a lead on Orlando heading into the fourth quarter of Sunday's thrilling game. San Antonio fell victim to what eventually became a game-sealing pick-six, but that was a terrific back-and-forth football game with a lot of positives. The Commanders have weapons with running back Kenneth Farrow and the emergence of receiver Demarcus Ayers. One negative, though: The defense I was so bullish on after Week 1? Yuck. There were a few too many busted coverages in the secondary. Previously: No. 4
The Iron cut it close at home against the Stallions, erasing a 9-0 halftime deficit to win 12-9. Gritty, certainly, but worrisome at times. Two-thirds of the Iron's offensive possessions were four plays or fewer, and their average yards per play for the game was 3.4. And the receiving drops? Woof. Birmingham had one offensive touchdown and the other, a muffed punt returned for a score, probably shouldn't have counted. I'll never dog on a team for finding a way to win -- the Iron are committed to grinding teams out with strong defense -- but if I'm sticking to my guns that explosiveness matters, this team is a couple of steps behind. Previously: No. 3
Like every other favorite this past weekend, the Fleet needed a rally to win. Shout out to Mike Martz's team for 1) getting their first touchdown of the year, 2) kicking down the front door in a 24-12 win over Atlanta and 3) doing it all in the pouring rain. There are still plenty of questions about the offensive line and quarterback situations, but this defense has looked strong over two weeks. Previously: No. 6
Thus begins our journey into the 0-fors. The Stallions have looked the best of the winless teams and defensive end Karter Schult (two sacks vs. Birmingham) is emerging as one of the top defensive players in the Alliance. But not having starting quarterback Josh Woodrum (hamstring) hurts and Austin Allen had his share of struggles in the Birmingham loss. Previously: No. 5
It wasn't over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor, and it wasn't over when the Express got shut out by the Iron in Week 1. Mike Singletary's team did an excellent job of getting Arizona out of its comfort zone with three turnovers in the first two quarters -- all in plus territory. What they didn't do well was converting those turnovers into points. A 12-0 halftime lead was nice, but didn't feel too comfortable. Sure enough, the Hotshots made a comeback. Memphis looked better from Week 1 to Week 2, but that offense remains a liability. A road game at Orlando in Week 3 is going to be a beast. Previously: No. 8
Atlanta's had an awful start with two road games: one against Orlando and the other in the driving rain. Those aren't excuses for why the Legends are 0-2, but they haven't helped. To Atlanta's credit, it did have a lead on San Diego, it just couldn't close it out. Back at home against Birmingham in Week 3, can the Legends finally get their first win? Previously: No. 7

Players on Our Radar 

Folks, we made it. Pro football is finally here ... again! 
Week 1 of the inaugural Alliance of American Football regular season is halfway over as the San Diego Fleet traveled to the San Antonio Commanders, while the Atlanta Legends went to Orlando to take on the Apollos. By the end of the night, there were two dramatically different results. San Antonio needed a strong defensive effort to outlast the Fleet while the Apollos didn't leave any doubt in handling the Legends. 
There will also be two more games on Sunday with Arizona, Birmingham, Memphis and Salt Lake City all squaring off (Here's how to watch all of this weekend's games). What should fans expect? It's hard to say, specifically, as there's simply no history from which to derive any kind of expectations, but hopefully, we'll see some good football. 
CBS Sports was with you the entire evening as the first two AAF games played out. Here's what went down on Saturday night ... 
Orlando Apollos 40, Atlanta Legends 6San Antonio Commanders 15, San Diego Fleet 6.
Orlando Apollos linebacker Terence Garvin was a journeyman in the NFL, but he's already making waves in the AAF. Even though the Apollos 40-6 victory was an offensive display, it was probably Garvin who came away as the most impressive player of the game. He had 10 tackles on the evening, including some in the backfield for negative plays, plus a pair of interceptions, one of which he returned to the house for a touchdown. You don't want to start teasing fate after one game -- Atlanta looks like it has a lot to sort out -- but Garvin did a little bit of everything. He was disruptive, played well in coverage and was all over the field. 
You're not going to believe this, but there was yet another interception in the San Diego-San Antonio game. However, the biggest one of the night came courtesy of Commanders defensive back Zack Sanchez, who showed great technique in this game-sealing pick. That helped the Commanders get a 15-6 win in the opener. While it might not have been the offensive showcase many around the AAF thought San Antonio would put on display, it was a good win nonetheless and should give Mike Riley's team confidence in its defense moving forward. 
The biggest interception in @aafcommanders history! What a play by Zack Sanchez! pic.twitter.com/h0OYbyOtPk
San Antonio and San Diego haven't exactly been participating in a barn burner. Both defenses have played well and forced key takeaways, including interceptions by both teams in the red zone. However, perhaps the most impressive interception of the evening came courtesy of San Diego's Ryan Moeller, who picked off a pass without any gloves. San Antonio was holding on to a 12-6 lead at the time, but the Commanders weren't going away.

Of course Steve Spurrier ran the "Philly Special" against Atlanta. Of course he did. Except this time it was the Orlando Special. Either way, it worked. Garrett Gilbert handed the ball off to Akeem Hunt, who flipped it to Jalin Marshall, who then hit Gilbert in the end zone for a touchdown to go up 22-6 on the Legends. It's a fun-as-hell play, but the reality is the Apollos have not needed tricks to dominate Atlanta.
THE ORLANDO SPECIAL! pic.twitter.com/BKztnVXWO1
The Apollos scored the first touchdown of the night (and for the AAF) when quarterback Garrett Gilbert connected with wide receiver Jalin Marshall on a strike over the middle of the field. Marshall, who was double-covered, came down with a tough catch, but Atlanta coach Kevin Coyle challenged the score. However, after further review, the officials determined that Marshall's elbow was down and he possessed the ball. 
"We've got a score." After some careful consideration, @aafAPOLLOS get the first touchdown in the history of @TheAAF. pic.twitter.com/dCTBYvCEMF
There are two things you can say about Atlanta kicker Younghoe Koo: 1) GREAT name. 2) He scored the first points, ever, for the AAF. Koo nailed a 38-yard attempt in the first quarter against the Orlando Apollos to give the Legends a 3-0 lead. The former Georgia Southern player spent one season with the Chargers in the NFL before joining the Legends. 
Boom. The first points in the history of @TheAAF belong to the @AafLegends. pic.twitter.com/SJAyWiU40v
Who says the AAF is all about offense? Granted, defenses are pretty much prevented from bringing the house, but that doesn't mean they can't get to the quarterback. Check out San Antonio linebacker Shaan Washington absolutely obliterate San Diego quarterback Mike Bercovici on this sack-fumble. It's sort of astonishing that Washington had that clear of a path fo Bercovici. Either way, what a highlight, and what a start for the Commanders' defense. 
Shaan Washington can BRING IT. pic.twitter.com/7VqYNk3DwD
There is some injury news for Saturday's games before things get rolling. Commanders running back Trey Williams (foot) and cornerback Jordan Thomas (thigh) are out for Saturday's game.   Fleet cornerback Curtis Mikell (ankle) is listed as doubtful.

Weekend Developments 

Week 2 of the AAF season is officially in the books. If nothing else, the games were far closer this time around than in Week 1. We also got the early candidate for game of the season thanks to a fun shootout between the Orlando Apollos and the San Antonio Commanders. The Sunday afternoon game featured 66 points, the first 300-yard passer of the season (Orlando's Garrett Gilbert) as well as the first 100-yard receiver of the year (Charles Johnson). 
That game was followed by the Atlanta Legends traveling on the road for the second-straight week as they took on the San Diego Fleet. In a downpour, the Fleet finally scored their first touchdown of the season and were able to pull away from the Legends, 24-12. 
CBS Sports was with you every step of the way. Here's a look at Sunday's highlights and storylines. 
Orlando Apollos 37, San Antonio Commanders 29San Diego Fleet 24, Atlanta Legends 12
SaturdayBirmingham Iron 12, Salt Lake City Stallions 9Arizona Hotshots 20, Memphis Express 18
Week 2 was full of highlights, but perhaps no play to date has been as improbable as this completion from San Diego quarterback Phillip Nelson to tight end Gavin Escobar. It was a classic completion of the "no no no no no no no ... yes!" variety. Nelson wasn't even looking in the right direction of Escobar when he threw it. And, yet, it counted all the same. What's more is that the Fleet scored later on the drive -- their first touchdown on the season -- in what would be a 24-12 victory. Better to be lucky than good, apparently. 
....how? This may be the craziest completion ever. pic.twitter.com/6Ilyd9Sysz
The Atlanta Legends scored more points in the first quarter Sunday than they did in their entire opening game. It started with a Younghoe Koo field goal, then the Legends got the ball right back after picking off an ugly pass from San Diego Fleet quarterback Philip Nelson. From there, Atlanta QB Matt Simms found Malachi Jones for the first Legends touchdown of the season and a 9-0 first-quarter lead.
SIMMS ➡️ JONES That #AllHailATL TD feels good, fellas.@malachijones_7 | @SimmsCompleteQB pic.twitter.com/DousRx2FaN
The Apollos have been playing from behind all day, but a quick two-touchdown swing has Orlando on top. First, quarterback Garrett Gilbert hit Jalin Marshall for a touchdown to tie the game at 29. The two-point conversion was no good. At the time of the score, Gilbert had 393 yards passing and a pair of touchdown passes, one to Marshall and one to Charles Johnson. 
TOUCHDOWN. TIE GAME. Steve Spurrier knew they had it right away. pic.twitter.com/IHtEEeVEfO
Then, on San Antonio's next possession, defensive back Keith Reaser picked off Logan Woodside and returned it all the way to the house for a touchdown. The Apollos' defense has been flirting with an interception all day, and you're not going to find a bigger one than that. 
PICK SIX! Keith Reaser comes up huge! @aafAPOLLOS grab the lead in the 4th quarter. pic.twitter.com/e1g8j4LnHx
The shootout between Orlando and San Antonio now has everything thanks to a defensive touchdown by way of large person Joey Mbu. The Commanders' defensive lineman picked up a sack-fumble from Apollos quarterback Garrett Gilbert and ran it in for a touchdown to give the Commanders a double-digit lead. It's not the first defensive touchdown in the AAF, but it has been the most entertaining one so far. 
SCOOP AND SCORE. It's a big man touchdown! pic.twitter.com/2CR38xtweB
It's not just Jalin Marshall who's stretching the field for the Apollos' passing attack. Charles Johnson has been the most impressive player on the field. He's come up with some huge catches, including a late second-quarter touchdown to put his team up 17-15 over the Commanders. Johnson has flashed some excellent route running, including this double move for the score. 
TAKE AIM! Garrett Gilbert and Charles Johnson are having a monster connection in the first half for the @aafAPOLLOS. pic.twitter.com/OLl7S1TgJn
Orlando might have the most exciting deep passing game of any team in the Alliance. The connection between quarterback Garrett Gilbert and receiver Jalin Marshall has been exciting to watch and already the two are hooking up for big plays against the commanders. This 57-yard deep strike over the middle led to a field goal that pulled the Apollos to within three points. 
57-yard pickup for the @aafAPOLLOS and Steve Spurrier is a fan. pic.twitter.com/rXICLJXSpA
Remember, the AAF is a development league, and San Antonio coach Mike Riley is taking that term literally. Riley replaced starting quarterback Logan Woodside with former North Carolina signal caller Marquise Williams during the second quarter to give Williams some reps. While making such a change when Woodside had just led two scoring drives seems counterintuitive, Riley has maintained he's liked what he's seen from Williams in practice. And, sure enough, Williams showed off his wheels on some big-time scrambles to keep the chains moving. San Antonio's initial drive with Williams at the helm ended in a 50-yard field goal. 
When you're a brand new football league, scripted drives aren't something to be taken for granted. And, yet, the Commanders' first offensive possession went exactly to script. San Antonio showed tremendous balance against Orlando, capping off the scoring drive with a highlight run and leap by running back Kenneth Farrow. The drive had a little bit of everything: some inside running, some outside dishes, a little zone read. With a second touchdown at the end of the first quarter, the Commanders lead 12-0.

More football? More football. Week 2 of the AAF got underway Saturday with an afternoon game between the Salt Lake City Stallions and Birmingham Iron. That was followed up by a night game with the Arizona Hotshots and Memphis Express. 
While both games got off to slow starts, they had tremendous finishes. Arizona and Birmingham, both favorites coming into the day, got behind early due to critical turnovers. However, they both rallied in the second half and came away with tougher-than-expected, but huge wins all the same. 
Were Saturday's thrilling endings an omen for Sunday favorites like Orlando and San Diego? We'll find out soon enough. 
CBS Sports was dedicated to being your one-stop shop for all things AAF. Below you'll find everything you need to catch up on Saturday's games, from helpful links to key updates and highlights from throughout the day. 
Birmingham Iron 12, Salt Lake City Stallions 9 Arizona Hotshots 20, Memphis Express 18
It wasn't as easy as Vegas oddsmakers made it seem, but the Hotshots got a gritty road win over the Express 20-18 thanks to a 14-0 run fourth-quarter run. Arizona initially overcame its slow start by pulling to within 12-6, but then gave up a quick touchdown to Memphis to fall behind 18-6. But then, just as they did in Week 1, the Hotshots got going thanks to a long touchdown run from Justin Stockton. 
What a run! @aafhotshots answer and we've got a ballgame in Memphis! #AZvsMEM pic.twitter.com/lEvT5ZJyGK
That was soon followed by a huge individual effort on a catch and run by Hotshots receiver Josh Huff, who set up a quick touchdown strike from John Wolford to running back Tim Cook. Arizona's offense didn't resemble its Week 1 self until the final quarter or so in the game, but better late than never. 
Watch it again from #⃣2⃣0⃣ #GoShots #AZvsMEM pic.twitter.com/NcbSfPnTrU
Arizona found moving the ball difficult in the early going. Credit to Memphis' defense, which came up with two big fourth-down stops, but turning the ball over a bunch (see below) is one way to play bad football. But towards the end of the third quarter, the Hotshots finally got a sustained drive going that resulted a much-needed touchdown pass from John Wolford to Rashad Ross to pull to within a possession. 
The @aafhotshots are back in it! @RocketRoss_19 gets his third TD of the season. #AZvsMEM pic.twitter.com/By4poturCS
However, Memphis responded immediately with its own 75-yard scoring drive, kick-started by Zac Stay's 50-yard run -- Stacy became the first AAF running back to eclipse 100 yards in a game -- and finished off by Christian Hackenberg's touchdown. With Arizona creeping back into the game, this was a clutch response. 
TRUE. GRIT. That's @chackenberg1 pic.twitter.com/TYiZxdAwga
Based on the Week 1 results, it was not the start many should have expected between Arizona and Memphis. A pair of first-quarter turnovers by the Hotshots led to nine points for the Express -- their first of the season. First, Memphis got great starting field position when Hotshots wide receiver Josh Huff fumbled the ball after getting leveled on a hit over the middle of the field. That led to an Express field goal.

Then, a John Wolford interception set Memphis up to score its first touchdown of the season thanks to a Zac Stacy run. A second Wolford interception in the second quarter led to another Express field goal and the Hotshots were not able to convert a fourth-down attempt on their own side of the 50, which for all intents and purposes worked out as a fourth turnover.
.@ZSTACY_ hits paydirt for the @aafexpress!#AZvsMEM pic.twitter.com/Q4KNKweHqD
Once again, it was not a huge statistical day for Iron running back Trent Richardson. But just as he did in Week 1 vs. Memphis, he seemed to get stronger as the game went along.
Richardson powered in for a late touchdown to give the Iron a 12-9 lead with just under five minutes remaining. The running back had been hampered by a hamstring injury, so it's honestly amazing he was as effective as he was on Saturday, showing the ability to move the pile, but also catch the ball out of backfield.
Trent Richardson gets in the endzone and the @aafiron take the lead! #SLvsBHM pic.twitter.com/QqlYEWTiMw
Following the touchdown, the Stallions did have one more opportunity to tie the game with a 48-yard field goal, but kicker Taylor Bertolet pulled the attempt wide line to finish 1 for 4 on the day with another potential attempt aborted due to a bad snap. Throw in the muffed punt that Birmingham turned into their first points of the day (more on that below), and it was truly a game to forget for Salt Lake's special teams unit.   
And now two muffed punts have led to touchdowns, though the latest from Stallions return man De'Mornay Pierson-El will certainly be more controversial. Pierson-El had the ball stripped out in the third quarter during a punt from the Iron, which was recovered for a touchdown. However, Salt Lake challenged the call.
Instant replay took multiple looks to see whether Pierson-El's knee was down before the ball came out. Ultimately, though, the replay official was not able to find enough evidence to overturn the call on the field. Salt Lake fans won't be happy with the decision, but it was a big moment for the Iron in getting back into this game. 
Never out of it ‼️#SLvsBHM #FORGEON⚒️🔥 pic.twitter.com/kVjjvasc61
Despite controlling the game for most of the first half, the Iron finds itself down 9-0 at the half thanks in part to a muffed punt return by Quan Bray that gave the Stallions good field position at the Birmingham 27-yard line. Four plays later, Joe Bouagnon rumbled in for the go-ahead score. 
Scoreless no more, @aafstallions find the endzone! #SLvsBHM pic.twitter.com/H17Tp8KpIY
The halftime score is a bit of a surprise considering that the Stallions are starting backup quarterback Austin Allen, who has understandably been shaky throughout most of the first 30 minutes. However, running back Branden Oliver has been a workhorse with 40 yards on the ground and some catches out of the backfield. He's put the offense on his back. 
Birmingham hasn't capitalized on its offensive possessions and had a rough ending to the second quarter. Following the Salt Lake City touchdown, the Iron were unable to convert a fake punt in their own territory, which led to the late Stallions field goal. The Iron like to play grind-it-out, possession football, but that doesn't necessarily lend itself well to playing from behind -- even if Salt Lake has problems of its own. 
One week into the season and the injury reports are already filling out. The biggest name featured this week is Iron running back Trent Richardson, who has been slowed by a right hamstring injury. He's active for Saturday, but has been limited this week in practice, and didn't participate at all on Thursday. Richardson rushed for a pair of touchdowns in last week's 26-0 win over the Express. 
Another key name mentioned in this week's injury reports was Salt Lake City quarterback Josh Woodrum, who also has a hamstring injury he sustained in the first half of last Sunday's loss to Arizona. He's listed as the third quarterback against the Iron, so don't expect to see him this week. He did not participate in practice on Wednesday and Thursday, and was limited on Friday. Austin Allen was announced as the starting quarterback for the Stallions just before kickoff.

Players We Prioritize 

In three hours on Sunday afternoon, we saw what the AAF could be. Orlando at San Antonio was easily the best game on paper in Week 2, but in a pleasantly surprising fashion, it didn't disappoint. Quite to the contrary, it exceeded expectations, which have had to be tempered as the new pro football league gets its proverbial sea legs. 
But once things click, it's a whole lot of fun to watch. If Orlando-San Antonio taught us anything, it's that offense is going to reign supreme in this league. With so many teams still leaning on defense to win, having the advantage of explosive offense is what separates the playoff contenders from the rest. It's no surprise, then, that teams like Orlando, Arizona and San Antonio look like they could make the postseason. 
What lessons did we learn from the AAF in Week 2? Here's a rundown from all that happened on Saturday and Sunday. 
When football fans jumped on the AAF bandwagon, Orlando's thrilling 37-29 win at San Antonio was the type of football they envisioned seeing. Through two weeks, that's rarely the football that's been delivered. Granted, patience is necessary. These teams came together a month ago. But it is with zero reservations that I say not only was this the best game of the season thus far, it'll be in contention with one of the best games of the year. 
Putting Orlando, the best vertical passing team in the AAF by a country mile, indoors in an environment like the Alamodome practically guaranteed this one would be a hit. It delivered. Apollos quarterback Garrett Gilbert hit three passes of more than 50 yards as part of his 393-yard performance. In all, Orlando averaged 8.4 yards per play on just 51 plays, and while they weren't overly successful in running the ball, they were able to grind out the win thanks to some huge runs from D'Ernest Johnson. 
Chunk yardage and efficiency matter, and this was the best example of why. And it wasn't just Orlando; San Antonio's offensive stats weren't as efficient -- for example: the Commanders averaged 5.1 yards per play -- but they were far better at running the ball (5.2 yards per rush) and still racked up nearly 400 yards of offense. Even in a loss, the Commanders looked like one of the top three teams in the Alliance. Could this game be a championship preview in April? After the way these two played, it wouldn't be that surprising. 
It's Week 2 and the timing with many of these passing routes isn't there yet. I get that. But Birmingham's wideouts, after having dropped five passes in a 26-0 win over Memphis, had another case of the dropsies against Salt Lake on Saturday. The most egregious one came in the first quarter when quarterback Luis Perez evaded pressure, somehow got out of a would-be sack and hurled the ball to Tobias Palmer, who dropped a surefire touchdown. The Iron then missed a 53-yard field goal on the next play. Then, in the third quarter, tight end Weslye Saunders fumbled the ball when running for a first down. 
Ball security isn't only an Iron problem at the moment, but what makes this particularly alarming is that possession passing is such a big part of their offensive game plan. (The Iron passed 60 percent of the time on Saturday and averaged 4.1 yards per attempt.) Outside of Quinton Patton, there's not a super reliable pass-catcher who can also stretch the field; in fact, running back Trent Richardson was the offense's leading receiver with six catches on seven targets for 50 yards -- and he was battling a hamstring injury. 
Birmingham is 2-0 and that's what is most important, but this offense has work to do at every position. Between Trent Richardson getting more volume than production and pass catchers that have put the ball on the ground, this team is flirting with an "L." They're simply not explosive enough to keep coming back from 9-0. (Then again, how many offenses around the Alliance are?) 
The AAF is a development league, so know that pretty much everyone playing needs some kind of development. But the two areas where that development is most noticeable are along the offensive line and at quarterback. Not surprisingly, those positions take the longest to come together. Offensive lines are built on chemistry. That takes time -- certainly more than a month. Quarterbacks have to command an offense and develop a rhythm with wide receivers. It's been an obvious struggle at times. 
Not coincidentally, the four teams with more secure quarterback situations are probably the four best teams in the Alliance. Orlando (Garrett Gilbert), Arizona (John Wolford), Birmingham (Luis Perez) and San Antonio (Logan Woodside) have the four highest-scoring offenses through two weeks. Again, quarterback play isn't the only factor in this, but it's one of the clear separating indicators as this season progresses. 
In the big picture, it'll be one of the factors for the overall success of the AAF. Each team "drafts" regionally through the allocation system when it puts its roster together, but quarterbacks are the only position that are actually drafted in the way with which we're familiar. That tells you how important it is. The AAF needs a higher ceiling of quarterback play beginning in Year Two. Whether that means getting more true NFL backups to come down and get reps, or tweak offensive schemes to better suit the skill set of the quarterbacks already in the alliance, this will need to be examined further. 
There are about-faces, and then there's Arizona scoring 38 points in Week 1 before turning the ball over five times -- two interceptions, two turnovers on downs and one fumble -- and failing to score for nearly three full quarters against Memphis on Saturday night. It was shocking, to say the least. The Hotshots were No. 1 in our Power Rankings and the Express were dead last, and Vegas had Arizona as a 13-point favorite in many books by the start of the game. 
Chalk those up to snap judgments. However, the reality was Arizona played poorly for about two-and-a-half quarters, and desperately needed things to click. Then, suddenly, they did. The Hotshots mounted a nine-play, 80-yard scoring drive towards the end of the third quarter, highlighted by Tim Cook's 28-yard run and Rashad Ross' 16-yard touchdown to make it 12-6. Though the Express were able to respond with a touchdown of their own on the ensuing drive, that would be their final points of the night. The Hotshots scored the final 14 points of the game on their next two drives to win 20-18. Arizona's possession on those two drives? A grand total of 11 plays, 162 yards (14.7 yards per play) and 4:22 of game time. Quarterback John Wolford hit six of his seven passes for 137 yards and two scores. 
What a run! @aafhotshots answer and we've got a ballgame in Memphis! #AZvsMEM pic.twitter.com/lEvT5ZJyGK
If you've watched enough AAF games through two weeks, you've seen how difficult it's been for offenses to get going. Call it Memphis playing not to lose if you must, but the fact that Arizona was able to turn on the jets when it absolutely needed to is impressive and part of the reason it'll likely be playoff-bound by April. When they're in sync, the trio of Wolford, Ross and Cook is as good as any in the league. 
Orlando Apollos wide receiver Charles Johnson: Not to give POTW honors to a member of the Apollos for the second-straight week, but Johnson was simply too good to ignore. The former Vikings receiver led everyone with seven receptions on 10 targets for 192 yards and a touchdown. Orlando has a few deep threats in the passing game, and as such the most efficient vertical offense in the Alliance, but Johnson was the star in the win at San Antonio. His route running was purposeful and effective. If he keeps this up, he'll get another look at the NFL.

Even though there isn't a lot of name recognition amongst players in the Alliance of American Football, the league promotes itself as extremely player-friendly. It's here to develop these guys in the hopes -- for most of them, anyway -- that they'll get another crack at the NFL down the road. So it only makes sense as we start to get into the meat of the AAF season that we share some of the biggest names to watch each weekend (here's how you can watch all four games in Week 3). 
Moving forward, we'll lay out five names you should know for the upcoming games. These are names who are usually coming off of big performances, or could be key matchup players for their games head -- especially if there are any fantasy football implications. For this first piece, you'll find a lot of players who have come up big in the first two weeks and/or were names to know coming out of training camp. We'll also try to give you a heads up on players who are generating some NFL buzz; that list will fill out a bit more as we get further into the season. 
With that said, here are five names to watch for Week 3 in the AAF, plus one for the road ... 
We'll start with the no-brainer. If there's a shortage of top-end quarterbacks in the NFL, then the AAF is at an even greater disadvantage at that position. Yet, in the search to find a quarterback capable of performing at a high level, the Apollos have found a bona fide star in Garrett Gilbert. The AAF's leading passer (620 yards, 4 TDs, 0 INTs) has been a journeyman for the past decade -- basically ever since leaving Lake Travis High School outside of Austin, Texas, as a blue-chip prospect in 2009. But he's found the right situation with coach Steve Spurrier, who calls plays and coaches the quarterbacks. The Apollos host the Express in Week 3, and Memphis is one of the AAF's worst pass defenses, allowing 7.0 yards per attempt. 
Week 3 stats: 14-of-28, 207 yards passing, 43 yards rushing, 2 TDs

There have been plenty of strong defensive line performances through the first couple of weeks. (Related: the fact that some offenses have yet to completely form plays a role in this.) However, Schult has been a standout performer from the get-go. Like so many others in the AAF, he was a small-school guy (shout out to Northern Iowa). Schult was most recently waived by the Panthers. Instead of continuing to try his luck in the NFL, Schult opted to go the AAF route and has been a terror in the backfield with a team-best 10 tackles and three sacks. Going against one of the top offenses in the AAF, Schult will need to be an impact player again vs. the Hotshots. 
Week 3 stats: 2 tackles, 1 sack

Ross has been the go-to guy for the Hotshots' passing attack with nine catches for 170 yards, second-best in the AAF, and three touchdowns already. He's a true threat to stretch the field because, at nearly 19 yards per reception, he can take the top off of a defense. Going against Salt Lake's defense in Week 3, Ross will be needed for big plays. The Stallions' secondary was gashed the first time these two teams met in Week 1. Ross could be a huge fantasy player as well. 
Week 3 stats: 8 targets, 6 receptions, 51 yards, TD
Suffice it to say there haven't been many breakout stars at running back -- yet. Stacy could be one of them, though. He's tied for the league-wide lead with 159 yards rushing at 5.1 yards per attempt and a touchdown. His production -- or volume, at least -- could increase beginning in Week 3. Earlier this week, the Express waived fellow running back Rajion Neal, paving the way for even more touches for Stacy moving forward. Given that Memphis doesn't have much in the way of a passing attack, it'll probably lean on Stacy to slow things down against Orlando. Stacy's fantasy value could skyrocket as a result. 
Week 3 stats: 14 carries, 29 yards
Luc's name came up frequently during training camp. He's establishing himself as a centerpiece of the defense, and against Birmingham's possession passing attack over the middle, he'll be important in a lot of facets. Luc's career arc has been interesting, to say the least. He began at Florida State before transferring to Cincinnati and then bounced around amongst a bunch of teams in the NFL for a few years. But he's settled in nicely into Atlanta's defense with eight tackles so far. If this is going to be the low-scoring rock fight many expect, Luc needs to have a big game. 
More on Birmingham Iron quarterback Luis Perez: After his solid debut against Memphis, CBS Sports was informed that as many as eight NFL scouts were intrigued by Perez. Since then, he's been a name that has come up on multiple occasions from people around the Alliance. Perez, whose story is as rare as any in the professional football, is the kind of player who fits perfectly into what this league strives to develop: coachable, talented guys who haven't quite gotten the looks they've needed to take their careers to the next level. Perez started his collegiate career as a walk-on at a San Diego area JUCO and made his way to Division II Texas A&M-Commerce before spending an offseason with the Rams. In two games, he's shown nice ball placement and touch down the field, plus the patience and awareness to make plays happen. If he keeps it up, he'll be back in the NFL.

Who are the best and worst teams in the Alliance of American Football? Through the first few weeks, it's undeniable: there's a clear separation, and some of it can be explicitly traced. In Orlando, the Apollos are 3-0 after Saturday's win, thanks to a good quarterback situation and a potent offense, for example. It's the exact opposite in Atlanta and Memphis.
However, some of it can't be traced -- at least not yet. Home teams went 6-2 against the spread and straight up in the first two weeks, so we know they tend to have a distinct advantage ... but will that change as more betting favorites hit the road? Or, as offenses develop more chemistry and timing, will parity finally start to shine through? It feels repetitive at times, but there really is still a lot to learn about the AAF product. In the meantime, though, there are four more games to be played. 
What should you watch for (and how?) on Sunday? Here's everything you need to know: 
Birmingham Iron at Atlanta LegendsDate: Sunday, Feb. 24 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Georgia State Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: CBS Sports Network | Live stream: CBS Sports Network
San Antonio Commanders at San Diego FleetDate: Sunday, Feb. 24 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: SDCCU Stadium -- San Diego, CaliforniaTV: NFL Network | Live stream: fuboTV (Try for free)

Birmingham at Atlanta: Here's your AAF rock fight of the weekend. The Iron have statistically the AAF's top defense, though they have yet to play any of the top offenses. That's not going to happen this weekend as the Legends have yet to get more than 12 points in a game. Can Luis Perez and Trent Richardson grind out another win?
San Antonio at San Diego: The Fleet open as a small favorite, but San Antonio's offense looked outstanding vs. Orlando last Sunday. The question is whether they can keep it going; the Commanders scored just 15 points vs. the Fleet in Week 1, though you could certainly chalk that up to working out the kinks. San Antonio also goes on the road for the first time this year. We'll learn a lot about this team come Sunday. 
Birmingham at Atlanta: The Iron are the better team, but they needed a big second-half rally to beat Salt Lake in Week 2. They're also not a particularly explosive offense. Atlanta being home for the first time this year is a welcome relief, but there's been so much coaching staff turnover from January and offensive ineptitude -- the Legends are tied for last in the AAF at 9 points per game -- that I wonder how much of a difference it'll make. Home teams have done well against the spread, so I'll take the Legends, the points and the under, but the Iron find a way. Pick: Legends +6, Under 40
San Antonio at San Diego: The Commanders are an interesting underdog here. Even though they lost last week, they looked better than the Fleet in a win over Atlanta. However, I wonder if an intense, emotional loss to the Apollos carries over for the Commanders. Vegas thinks this one will be tight. I tend to agree. Pick: Fleet -2, Under 43.5

Through the first two weeks of the Alliance of American Football, if we've learned anything it's that playing on the road is a bear. Shocker, right? Only twice so far has a road team covered, both in Week 2. But even the best team in the Alliance, the Orlando Apollos, needed a late pick-six to seal a road victory a week ago. While it's still to be determined how much value we should assign to home-field advantage -- is it greater than three points? -- we can deduce that going on the road means it's hard to cover. 
We find, again, some top-four teams in perilous spots as the AAF moves into its third week. The Birmingham Iron and Arizona Hotshots go on the road to Atlanta and Salt Lake City, respectively, as one-score favorites; the San Antonio Commanders are actually a two-point dog at the San Diego Fleet. Will this introduce the first round of chaos into the AAF's regular season? It's time to parse through all four games on Saturday and Sunday.

An intriguingly small line here for the top team in the West on the road against a winless team. This was a 16-point win for the Hotshots in Tempe just two weeks ago -- and Salt Lake had its starting quarterback, Josh Woodrum, for a half before he injured his hamstring. Obviously, Woodrum's health is a factor in whether the Stallions can cover. Playing at home for the first time should help, and given that these two teams know each other already, I'll side with the defenses making enough plays to sweat the under. Arizona has just enough big-play ability to cover, though. 
Pick: Hotshots -4.5, Under 46
The Express covered against (and nearly beat) Arizona in Week 2 because of poor ball security and execution by the Hotshots. In all, Arizona had five turnovers (two on downs, two interceptions and one fumble). Otherwise, there still wasn't a lot of life from Memphis' offense (3.5 yards per play). They'll be going up against the best offense in the AAF, and certainly the best passing offense. Meanwhile, Memphis gives up seven yards per attempt through the air, second-worst in the Alliance. Though I'm wary of a spread this big, the Apollos are rolling. 
Pick: Apollos -15.5, Over 45.5
Finally, Atlanta gets a home game. Unfortunately, it's against the Iron, a team that makes you feel as though you're playing football in a swamp with lead shoes. And Birmingham boasts the best passing defense and second-best overall defense in yards per play. The Legends are winless, which means they'll be playing angry. They certainly looked improved from Week 1 to Week 2. I'll give them the cover, but this is setting up to be a low-scoring rock fight. 
Pick: Legends +6.5, Under 40
How will the Commanders respond after losing an intense, emotional game on Sunday to the Apollos? A road trip to San Diego, a familiar opponent, won't be easy -- especially not since the Fleet have a win under their belt. We also don't know how San Antonio is going to do on the road for the first time, but away teams are 2-6 against the spread. I'm still concerned about San Diego's O-line -- it took the offense seven quarters into the season to score their first touchdown -- but I think they catch San Antonio at a good time. I wouldn't be surprised if, once again, this one is low scoring and anyone's game going into the fourth quarter. 
Pick: Fleet -2.5, Under 43.5

Weekend Developments 

It was going to take some time for these teams to find their groove -- anyone who's followed the Alliance of American Football's inaugural season knows that by now.
So it's no coincidence that Week 4 of the AAF is the most interesting one to date on paper and the Express and Apollos got things started with wins on Saturday.
For the most part, the parity promised by co-founder Bill Polian is there, it just had to develop. But if Week 3 taught us anything, it's that the level of competition is beginning to even out. The Salt Lake Stallions pulled off the first actual upset, beating the Arizona Hotshots 23-15. Meanwhile, the league's best team, the Orlando Apollos, survived a revived Memphis Express. 
As such, there are way more storylines and points of interest heading into Week 4. For the first time this year, really, there's a more evenly distributed intrigue in what happens. Here's everything you need to know to watch Sunday's games. 
San Antonio Commanders at Birmingham IronDate: Sunday, March 3 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Legion Field -- Birmingham, AlabamaTV: CBS Sports Network | Live stream: CBS Sports Network  
Atlanta Legends at Arizona HotshotsDate: Sunday, March 3 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Sun Devils Stadium -- Tempe, ArizonaTV: NFL Network | Live stream: fuboTV (Try for free)  
San Antonio at Birmingham: How San Antonio picks itself up will be interesting to follow. The Commanders started with a lot of promise, but have dropped two games in a row and Vegas projects a third. The 31-11 loss at San Diego was alarming, but that was also the first time it played on the road. With one game away from the Alamodome under its belt, can San Antonio circle the wagons at Birmingham? It would be surprising to see another 20-point margin, at the very least. The Iron don't have the big-play potential like the Fleet or Apollos. Rather, Birmingham has suffocated all three opponents to date through defense. 
Atlanta at Arizona: Normally, the forecast for this game would be akin to a famous Slayer song. However, the health status of Hotshots quarterback John Wolford is worth watching. He injured his back in the Week 3 loss to the Stallions and Trevor Knight struggled to move the sticks through the air in relief. Per a team spokesperson, he was in full pads for practice on Wednesday. However, no team has gotten off to a worse start than Atlanta. The winless Legends are playing their third road game in a month, average 10 points per game and are being outscored by an average of nearly 21 points per game. Wolford's status gives this game some interest, but not much. 
San Antonio at Birmingham (-7.5), O/U 39.5: The Iron would seem like a guarantee to hit the under (last week's 28-12 win over the Legends was a push, and Atlanta has the worst point differential in the league) but this point total has dipped too low. Since Birmingham doesn't pick up a lot of chunk plays, I'm expecting a fairly tight game on the scoreboard. Still, that defense is full of ball hawks and Commanders quarterback Logan Woodside already has five picks. Birmingham is good at home, too, so I'll lay the points as the Commanders' slide continues. Pick: Birmingham -7.5, Over 39.5
SportsLine's No. 1 pro football expert, R.J. White, went 2-0 against the spread Saturday and is now 5-1 in the AAF! See his Sunday picks here.
Atlanta at Arizona (-12), O/U 41.5: Let's see, Atlanta is not only 0-3 on the season, but 0-3 against the spread with the worst scoring defense by a country mile. Hotshots quarterback John Wolford should be 100 percent by this weekend, too, after suffering a lower back strain in the loss to the Stallions. Nothing says get-right game like coming back home against the worst team in the Alliance. Still, no double-digit favorite has covered yet. Pick: Atlanta +12, Under 41.5

Players We Prioritize 

The midway point of the AAF regular season is in the books, and we saw three of the four games go down to the wire in wild fashion. 
The Salt Lake Stallions had yet another heartbreaking loss, this time to the San Diego Fleet, as they gave up a game-winning field goal after taking the lead with under a minute left. At 1-3, the Stallions are the most frustrating team in the AAF, as they keep falling apart in late-game situations. In the other Saturday game, the trend of backup quarterbacks rallying their teams continued, as Keith Price came in for the Birmingham Iron against the league-best Orlando Apollos. The Iron ultimately came up short, but Price gave fans a lot to look forward to.
On Sunday, it was a fun battle between 1-3 teams as the Atlanta Legends -- led by Aaron Murray -- took on Zach Mettenberger and the Memphis Express. Mettenberger struggled, but Murray played well enough to get the Legends the win behind kicker Younghoe Koo, who's perfect on the season and hit his second straight game-winning FG.
Finally, the San Antonio Commanders-Arizona Hotshots game was a tale of two halves, as the Hotshots nearly clawed their way back from a 26-0 halftime deficit. Though they came up four points short, quarterback John Wolford showed why he's worth gambling on, and the Commanders showed why they're the West team most capable of challenging the Apollos.
Here are all our takeaways from Week 5:
Call it the Commanders playing overly conservative, call it the Hotshots playing with nothing to lose. Whatever happened, San Antonio nearly lost the 26-0 lead it took into halftime over the Hotshots. Arizona's John Wolford came out rough, throwing a pick-six to Derron Smith on the opening possession of the game. Two interceptions and a fumble later, and the Hotshots found themselves down by 26, and the Commanders were rolling.
In the second half, something clicked for the Hotshots. Wolford looked more confident airing it out, and Rashad Ross had a phenomenal half. The Hotshots clawed back, scoring 25 of the game's next 28 points, but a fumble on a fourth-and-12 (which the AAF uses instead of an onside-kick attempt) and a sack taken by Wolford on another onside attempt ultimately proved to be too much to overcome.
The Hotshots are true to their name: Unbelievably streaky, and one of the best offenses in the game when Wolford is on. However, when Wolford struggles, things pile up quickly. This is three-straight losses for our preseason No. 1 team after a 2-0 start, and they now trail the Commanders as well as the Fleet in the West.
Even the comeback had some seriously ugly moments. Arizona's final scoring drive had two-straight interceptions that were negated by a hold before the throw and a pass interference after Wolford threw into triple coverage. Thought they managed to punch it in, the offense never seemed to have rhythm.
The Commanders, for all of their flaws, have emerged as contenders in this league. They have work to do, but Logan Woodside looks poised, and their secondary is starting to shore itself up -- if only a little bit. Having a guy make these throws is huge.

Then there are plays like this, which are just beautifully designed.

The Commanders need to keep their foot on the gas, but they're the West team that's proven most capable of challenging the Apollos in the East. Moving forward, we'll see if they can navigate the West first.
While we shouldn't be looking at the AAF as a pipeline to the NFL just yet, Younghoe Koo might be playing his way into an NFL contract. Koo connected on three field goals in the Legends' 23-20 win over the Memphis Express, including a go-ahead field goal with just nine seconds left -- his second-straight game-winner. The kicking fraternity is tight, and good kickers are so rare NFL teams may be looking to kick the tires on guys who do well in these leagues -- despite Koo's struggles in his brief stint with the Chargers.

Koo is 11 of 11 on field-goal attempts this season, accounting for 33 of the Legends' 67 points. Koo couldn't be on a better team to showcase his talents, as the Legends have been woefully bad inside of the 20-yard line.
Time and time again on Sunday, the Express got the Legends into third-and-5-plus yardage situations. And time and time again, the Legends were able to convert. Aaron Murray and Seantavious Jones were a strong connection all day, and Malachi Jones contributed as well. With a steady diet of misdirection plays, the Express defense was kept off balance, and the Legends dominated the time of possession battle.
Zac Stacy played well for the Express, providing a scoring presence in the red zone, but it ultimately wasn't enough. Zach Mettenberger failed to impress, throwing a backbreaking interception late with the Express knocking on the door in a 20-20 game.
Only time will tell if Murray is actually the answer at quarterback for the Legends, but lately the strategy of "get Koo in position to kick it" has proven to be effective. While the Legends need to improve upon their red-zone offense, right now they should just celebrate the winning streak.
Though 3-1 heading into Saturday's game against Orlando, Birmingham had one of the least-efficient offenses in the Alliance, averaging fewer than five yards per play per game. And even though starting quarterback Luis Perez had one of the most incredible stories of perseverance in professional football, he wasn't improving. His pick-six to Apollos cornerback Keith Reaser in the first quarter of a 31-14 loss was his third interception on the season -- and he still hadn't thrown a touchdown. 
Perez was replaced on the following possession by Keith Price, who provided an instant spark to the Iron's beleaguered offense. The former Washington Huskies signal-caller did what Perez could not: escape the pocket and extend the play. Price's legs were valuable -- Orlando had a hard time bringing down the slippery quarterback -- but he also picked apart Orlando's zone defense, connecting with tight end Wes Saxton for a team-leading 75 yards. 
Ooooh baby, that drive was nice.#ORLvsBHM #ForgeOn⚒🔥 pic.twitter.com/tGWR0OKJm4
It can be difficult for defenses to corral mobile quarterbacks coming off the bench. Orlando prepared all week to see Perez, who until Saturday had taken every snap for the Iron. As a result, one of the AAF's best defenses didn't have much of an answer for Price's 249 yards of total offense. Price's ability to escape the pocket and make plays downfield led, finally, to the Iron's first passing score of the season. 
That'll do. #ForgeOn⚒🔥#ORLvsBHM pic.twitter.com/K7Ee1ZMb38
Price is the fourth notable quarterback to come off the bench and make a positive impact for his team, joining the likes of Memphis' Mettenberger, Atlanta's Murray and San Diego's Philip Nelson (though Nelson is sidelined with a clavicle injury for the next month). Birmingham may not have beat the AAF's best team, but Price led two scoring drives to make it a one-possession game in the third quarter. Orlando is just that good and always seems to have a response for whatever is thrown its way. The 14 points doesn't tell the whole story. The Iron were far more effective and fun to watch with Price.  
It wouldn't be right to call the Stallions "unlucky." They aren't 1-4 by accident. Eventually, you are what your record says you are. But no team has lost in gut-punching fashion as frequently as this one. In Week 2, the Stallions blew a 9-0 lead over Birmingham to lose 12-9. In Week 4, they stayed within striking distance of Orlando and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter, only to lose 20-11. Then, on Saturday, after taking a dramatic 25-24 lead over San Diego in the final minute of the game, the Stallions gave up a game-winning field goal as time expired. 
As promised, fireworks on and off the field. 🎆🎆What a game! What a night! #AllHandsOnDeck pic.twitter.com/GfeQZ48EL9
Salt Lake City has been a part of some great finishes ... it's just been on the wrong side of them. Saturday's game is one the Stallions could have won. They relinquished a halftime lead, allowing San Diego to score three-straight touchdowns spanning the third and early part of the fourth quarters. Two of those touchdowns were defensive scores: a 41-yard fumble return by Jordan Martin and an 18-yard pick-six by Kam Kelly. But even after scoring 14 unanswered points of their own in the final four minutes, the Stallions still couldn't find a way to finish. 
Multiple front office members from other teams around the AAF have expressed the same sentiment: that Salt Lake City is a tougher team than a single win would indicate. The excitement of Week 5's final quarter was a reflection of that, as is the tough schedule SLC has played so far. Five points is all that separates this team from being 3-2 instead of 1-4. The margins have been razor thin. Maybe the Stallions will finish stronger in the back stretch of the season -- this team is good enough to make the playoffs -- but the room for error is starting to shrink. 
Kelly had not one, not two, but three interceptions against the Stallions, including a pick-six in the fourth quarter. The first two interceptions were poor balls by Stallions quarterback Josh Woodrum, but they were valuable all the same as Salt Lake City was putting together potential scoring drives. The third pick was a perfectly timed break on the ball that went the other way for six. Here are all three for your viewing pleasure.

Draft Strategies for Every Format 

Week 6 in the AAF is here and there's an interesting juxtaposition between offenses and point totals. On one hand, offenses are clearly getting better. More points are being scored and teams are moving the ball better as they settle in to more established personnel groupings. 
However, a look at the point totals for this weekend still show a heavy lean towards lower-scoring games. Three of the four opening totals from MGM are 40 or below. Whereas point totals opened big and came down some in the first few weeks of the season, you might see the opposite effect in the coming weeks. 
In any case, with offenses operating at their highest efficiency so far, Week 6 should have some entertaining games on tap after the wild action across the Alliance in Week 5. Here are this week's picks for Week 6. Lines and point totals are courtesy of MGM. 
I wouldn't be surprised to see this line fall a point or two before the start of this game. Even with home field advantage, a full touchdown is a lot for a favorite with just one win. Besides, Memphis has been keeping games close since switching to Zach Mettenberger at quarterback. Mett has the arm to stretch the field -- he's also the second-most efficient quarterback in the AAF -- and the Stallions have the worst passing defense in the league. The bigger question for me is the point total. While neither defense is amazing, the offenses aren't putting up a ton of points in the red zone, either.
Pick: Memphis +8, Under 39.5
The line is just big enough to almost make me take the Hotshots. If it were any bigger, I might. For one, no team has covered as huge favorites. Also, for as frustrating as Arizona has been, it does have the ability to put points on the board in a hurry. The connection between quarterback John Wolford and Rashad Ross vs. Orlando's excellent pass defense should be the deciding matchup in this game. The Apollos have had so many answers to every challenge they've faced, so I'll take them to cover and bang the over at home, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the Hotshots made this a game. The matchup is intriguing. 
Pick: Orlando -9.5, Over 43.5
The Commanders end their four-game road tour in Week 6 and not a moment too soon. The Legends have won two straight since making the switch to quarterback Aaron Murray. Not only that, Atlanta's defense has been playing well as of late, too. All in all, it's not that surprising to see the Legends as a slight favorite. However, it's worth noting that the Commanders are 2-1 on this road game stretch. If Murray can hit enough big plays down the field against San Antonio's porous pass defense it has a chance, but the Commanders have plenty of firepower, too. 
Pick: San Antonio +1, Over 40
These are two of the better defenses in the Alliance, and there has been plenty of quarterback rotation for both sides, but lord have mercy that point total is awfully low. The Fleet are undefeated at home, but Birmingham might have new life with Keith Price at quarterback. He racked up nearly 250 yards of offense and threw a touchdown pass in a Week 5 loss to Orlando. Will Price make enough plays to win, though? The Fleet got two defensive touchdowns a week ago and can clearly win leaning on that side of the ball. 
Pick: Birmingham +6, Over 35.5

Week 5 was, from start to finish, the most entertaining of the season. Two games were decided by game-winning kicks while San Antonio nearly gave away a 26-point lead to Arizona in a wild finish. If the unpredictability of this past weekend tells us anything, it's that there are still five or six teams capable of getting about three playoff spots. (For all intents and purposes, Orlando is the team to beat.) 
So what does that mean for this week's power rankings? Three teams -- Arizona, Birmingham and Salt Lake City -- are in free-fall mode. The Hotshots, once the preseason No. 1 team on here, has lost three straight. Birmingham has back-to-back loses and the Stallions, for whatever reason, can't quite finish like they need to. 
With the second half of the season officially underway, here's how the AAF power rankings look at the midway point. 
Can anyone catch Orlando? No, it seems. The Apollos have had an answer for everything and are beating opponents by an average of 14.4 points per game. Up next is a home game against a free-falling Hotshots team followed by two interesting road games against divisional opponents Atlanta and Memphis -- both of which have changed their quarterbacks. Previously No. 1. 
I'm not sure what was more impressive: jumping out to a 26-0 halftime lead against the Hotshots, or nearly squandering all of it in the second half. The Commanders have firepower, that's for sure. Receiver Mekale McKay (91 yards on 5 catches Sunday) is a star and one of the best three or four receivers in the league. San Antonio is No. 2 because they're playing like one of the best teams in the AAF ... until they're not. In which case they could be somewhere between No. 2 and No. 6. Who knows! Previously: No. 3
Steve Spurrier is the favorite to win Coach of the Year, but Mike Martz is the only other viable candidate at the moment. He has this team above .500, tied for first in the division and won his first game without starting quarterback Philip Nelson, who is out with a clavicle injury. The Fleet needed their defense to step up against Salt Lake City on Saturday, and they did with two non-offensive touchdowns: a scoop-and-score and pick-six. Previously: No. 4
Two straight losses have been revealing, but there's potential with quarterback Keith Price coming off the bench. The next month will be fascinating, though. Four of the next five games, including a pair of divisional matchups, are on the road. If Price can play like he did against Orlando -- accumulating nearly 250 yards of offense and keeping plays alive -- the Iron can weather this storm. They are, on paper, one of the two best teams in the East division. Previously: No. 2
This has been a bizarre three-game slide, but in erasing a 26-0 deficit and nearly coming from behind to beat the Commanders, the Hotshots showed why they're still one of the most exciting teams in the AAF. John Wolford can sling it and Rashad Ross will be catching passes in the NFL next fall. If Arizona can get it together they have as good a shot as making the playoffs as any team in the West. But first, they have to stop the bleeding. Going to Orlando in Week 6 isn't exactly the best remedy for that. Previously: No. 6
Back-to-back wins and the Legends have started to crawl their way out of the basement. The offense has found its mojo with Aaron Murray and a home game against the Commanders in Week 6 is a huge opportunity to get to .500. There's still some work to be done to be one of the top two teams in the East, but the signs are more promising now than just a couple of weeks ago. Previously: No. 8 
The Stallions are a whopping five points from being 3-2 and in the top four of the power rankings. So, yeah, they've had some bad beats. Ultimately, though, you are what your record says you are, and Salt Lake City has one win (which started Arizona's three-game skid, mind you, so it looks even less impressive by the week). Despite having a ferocious defensive front, a solid running game and a decent quarterback, this team hasn't been able to finish. Until they do, to the power rankings cellar they go. Previously: No. 5
Previously: No. 7

Johnny Manziel is on the hunt for a new job after being released by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. In a release, the Alouettes say they severed ties with the quarterback, with the CFL's backing, after they "found that Manziel had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league." Moreover, the CFL is making sure that no one in the league can sign Manziel moving forward. 
With Manziel basically prohibited from playing in Canada, the natural follow-up question is whether he would try his luck with either the AAF or the XFL, which returns in 2020. Given Manziel's past problems with substance-abuse issues and short-lived, underwhelming career with the Cleveland Browns, a return to the NFL is such a long shot that only Lloyd Christmas likes the odds. But Manziel is "exploring new options."
I want to thank Coach Sherman, my teammates, and the CFL fans. My time there reestablished my love for the game of football and the work that goes into it. I look forward to exploring new options within the United States.
Regarding the AAF, there are a few things to consider. First are the technicalities. An Alliance spokesperson told CBS Sports that if Manziel was picked up by the AAF through the allocation formula set up by co-founder Bill Polian, he would be sent to the San Antonio Commanders. Manziel played college football at Texas A&M, where he was a Heisman Trophy winner in 2012. Multiple players on the Commanders' roster came from A&M. 
However, why Manziel was not only released by the Alouettes, but effectively barred from the CFL, is a major detail in whether the AAF would be willing to pick up such a polarizing player at all. The CFL did not explicitly state why Manziel was being cut and the AAF is looking into it further. In the meantime, new Alliance chairman Tom Dundon told USA Today that the league has offered Manziel to come work out.
Manziel to the AAF makes surface-level sense, as the AAF had reportedly reached out to big-name quarterbacks in the past who are currently out of the NFL: Colin Kaepernick and Tim Tebow. Kaepernick wanted $20 million or more, according to the Associated Press, which obviously wouldn't jibe with the typical three-year, non-guaranteed $250,000 contracts AAF players receive. Kaepernick recently reached a settlement in his collusion case against the NFL, anyway, so he's likely at least $20 million richer. Tebow, meanwhile, was more interested in pursuing his baseball career instead of joining the Orlando Apollos (who are plenty happy with Garrett Gilbert). 
Regardless, Kaepernick and Tebow would have been good for the visibility of the AAF. One could argue that Manziel, in his own right, would also be good for viewership, especially since 1) there aren't enough entertaining quarterbacks to go around for every team and 2) Manziel's mobility helps when offensive lines haven't come together. 
"Right now, it's a decision of the GMs, and they can decide what they want to do," Dundon told USA Today. "If talent-wise this is close, the negative of him is that there is drama with him and you are trying to win games and build a team. The positive is that he brings in fans and attention."
Manziel would be a project, of course, but that is common for players in the AAF. He wouldn't necessarily have to join with the intentions of reaching the NFL again, either; that is certainly a theme among many of the AAF's players, but it isn't an exclusive one. And since the contracts in the AAF are non-guaranteed, there's minimal risk incurred by the Commanders if they acquired Manziel.  However, there's also the matter of whether Manziel would be a cultural fit for the AAF. The Alliance parades a no-diva, no-attitude problem type of league. Manziel's history suggests a lot of problems that don't mesh with those ideals. 
Whether Manziel joins the AAF, the XFL or neither is based on numerous factors in a fluid situation. He might find there's better exposure and/or money in the XFL. If he's hellbent on getting back to the NFL, the AAF has much stronger ties. But, as of the most recent news, there are no certainties the AAF would even take Manziel.

The Orlando Apollos will travel to take on the San Antonio Commanders in Week 2 action on Sunday in the Alliance of American Football. Both teams earned a victory last week and will look to start the season with a 2-0 record. The Apollos and Commanders will meet first in an AAF doubleheader on Sunday, with the game scheduled to kick off at 4 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network. The Apollos are six-point favorites with the total at 44.5 in the most recent Apollos vs. Commanders odds. Before you make any Apollos vs. Commanders picks or AAF predictions, you'll want to hear what legendary pro football handicapper Hammerin' Hank Goldberg has to say.
The legendary handicapper capped the NFL season in style: Over the final six weeks, he went 12-3-2 against the spread on his best bets, including going 3-0 on conference championship Sunday and nailing the easiest under ever in Super Bowl LIII. Anyone who's been following him lately is up big.
This is the same handicapper who enjoyed 15 winning seasons in his 17-year ESPN run. In 2017, Hammer competed against 10 top handicappers in the Las Vegas Review-Journal NFL Challenge and beat them all, finishing 50-29-6 in against-the-spread picks. 
For Sunday, Hammerin' Hank knows that Orlando's offense is legit and their defense was one of the most disruptive in the league in Week 1. 
The Apollos put up 40 points in their opener thanks to a solid ground attack and a strong day from quarterback Garrett Gilbert. Akeem Hunt rushed for 73 yards on 10 carries and the Apollos ran for 135 yards as a team while Gilbert threw for 227 yards and two touchdowns without an interception. Jalin Marshall had three catches for 51 yards and a score while also throwing a touchdown pass in the win. 
Then on defense, former Steelers linebacker Terence Garvin had eight tackles and two of the team's three interceptions while the defense also recorded three sacks. If the Apollos continue to dominate the turnover battle like they did in Week 1, they'll be a force and can easily cover the six-point spread on the road. 
However, don't expect the Commanders to make things easy for the Apollos as they make their debut in front of the San Antonio fans. 
Orlando looked like it had an Atlanta defense thoroughly outgunned in Week 1, but the Apollos will have a much harder time against a stout Commanders defense. San Antonio held San Diego to just 295 yards of total offense in a 15-6 victory, while forcing three turnovers in the game.
The Commanders defensive line is anchored by Damontre Moore, a former third-round pick who had had 9.5 sacks in a two-year span with the Giants and Dolphins in 2014 and 2015. Moore wreaked havoc up front in his first game in the AAF, recording 1.5 sacks. If the Apollos can't figure out how to keep Moore out of their backfield on Sunday, they could be in for a long day in San Antonio.
Now, using his unmatched sources on NFL and AAF coaching staffs, Hammer has dialed in on Week 2 of the new league and released a strong ATS pick on Orlando-San Antonio. We can tell you he's leaning over, but his bigger play is on the side. He says one critical x-factor will determine the spread winner.

Saturday night inside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, a heavyweight championship boxing showdown comes our way featuring two undefeated power punchers. The WBC heavyweight champion "The Bronze Bomber" Deontay Wilder will put his title on the line against Luis Ortiz in a fight many fans are looking forward to. And when all is said and done on Saturday night, the champion will be coming away a couple million dollars richer. 
Hours before the WBC title fight is set to go down in Brooklyn, the fight purses were revealed and Wilder (39-0, 38 KOs) will be coming away with significantly more than the challenger Ortiz (28-0, 24 KOs). The champion has been guaranteed a purse of $2.1 million to show Saturday, while Ortiz will net himself $500,000 for stepping into the ring against one of the best boxers in the game. Of course, should Ortiz pull off the upset and become WBC champion, more money will certainly be in his near future. 
As the popularity of the champion Wilder continues to grow, so does his bank account. For comparison, when he viciously knocked out Bermane Stiverne in their rematch in November 2017, the Bronze Bomber walked away with $1.4 million. Prior to that last bout, he earned $900,000 for his fifth-round TKO win over Gerald Washington in February 2017, $1.5 million for his ninth-round KO win over Artur Szpilka in January 2016 and $1 million for his January 2015 unanimous decision win over Stiverne to capture the WBC title.
The Wilder vs. Ortiz card takes place Saturday evening beginning at 9 p.m. ET and can be seen on Showtime.

LOS ANGELES -- A heavyweight title bout so good, the judges decided they should do it again.
In his first bout of significance since he shocked the world by upsetting his way to the heavyweight championship in 2015, Tyson Fury survived a pair of hellacious knockdowns -- including one in Round 12 -- and appeared to outclass WBC champion Deontay Wilder before settling for a split draw in front of 17,698 fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.
The first heavyweight title pay-per-view bout in America since 2002 saw both fighters combine for a modern classic that was overflowing with tension and drama. One judge had it considerably wide at 115-111 for Wilder while the second had it 114-112 for Fury. The final scorecard was 113-113. CBS Sports scored it 115-111 for Fury.
While the fight played out exactly in favor of each fighter's strengths as Fury controlled by boxing with constant feints and awkward angles while Wilder (40-0-1, 39 KOs) picked his spots to land heavy counter shots which threatened to end the fight. But the bigger story was the 30-year-old Fury's ability to come back from so much turmoil outside the ring and regain his prime form of three years ago despite a lengthy battle with mental illness, substance abuse and a period in which he ballooned to as high as 400 pounds in 2017.
"We're on away soil, I got knocked down twice, but I still believe I won that fight," Fury said. "I'm being a total professional here. I went to Germany to fight [Wladimir] Klitschko [in 2015] and I went to America to fight Deontay Wilder. God bless America.  The 'Gypsy King' has returned.
"I'm what you call a pro athlete that loves to box.  I don't know anyone on the planet that can move like that. That man is a fearsome puncher and I was able to avoid that.  The world knows I won the fight."
Fury (27-0-1, 19 KOs) not only retained his speed and elusiveness, he was as daring as ever in the face of the sport's most dangerous puncher by slipping hard shots and countering clean as he taunted Wilder throughout the fight. With the American crowd surprisingly by his side, Fury also showed tremendous heart by overcoming fears he would gas out late and getting up from a two-punch knockdown in Round 12 that would've finished almost any other fighter.
Not only did Fury go on to outland Wilder, 84 to 71, according to CompuBox, he appeared to have the better stamina and landed the more telling punches outside of Wilder's two knockdowns. Yet Wilder's calling card of never being out of the fight proved true as he nearly won in dramatic fashion in the final round while seemingly down on the scorecards.
"I think with the two knockdowns I definitely won the fight," Wilder said. "We poured our hearts out tonight. We're both warriors, but with those two drops I think I won the fight. I came out slow. I rushed my punches. I didn't sit still.  I was too hesitant. I started overthrowing the right hand and I just couldn't adjust."
Talk after the fight immediately turned to a rematch with Fury saying, "100 percent, we'll do it." Wilder held a contractual rematch clause if he lost although it remains uncertain whether a draw would allow him to activate it.
Either way, one thing to consider is that Fury is a broadcast free agent in the United States, which means it's possible he could eschew the rematch in favor of fighting British countryman and unified champion Anthony Joshua for more money. Joshua (22-0, 21 KOs) - holder of the IBF, WBA and WBO titles - has grown to become the biggest star in the sport globally and recently switched his U.S. television home from Showtime to upstart streaming service DAZN.
"I would love for it to be my next fight," Wilder said of the rematch. "Why not? Let's give the fans what they want to see. It was a a great fight and let's do it again. It doesn't matter to me where we do it.
"We're the two best in the world and we proved it tonight. When you get two warriors you get a great fight. That's what we proved tonight and I'm ready to do it again."
Wilder, 33, made the eighth defense of the WBC title he captured in 2015. Fury, meanwhile, defended the division's lineal championship he never lost which dates back to his 2015 win over Klitschko.
Fury largely outboxed Wilder for the first half of the bout until a short right hand caught him on the temple and dropped him early in Round 6. Fury got up quickly and rallied to nearly win back the round as Wilder appeared as if he might've punched himself out going for the finish.
"I was rushing my punches, that's something I usually don't do," Wilder said. "I couldn't' let it go tonight. I was forcing my punches too much instead of sitting back being patient and waiting it.  I really wanted to get him out of there give the fans what they want to see.
"I didn't feel no pressure at all. When I rush my punches like that I'm never accurate. The rematch I guarantee I'm going to get him.
The second half saw more of the same as Fury successfully avoided Wilder's right hands and limited his output with constant movement. But the final round saw Wilder land a right cross and follow with a devastating left hook to the chin that knocked Fury down hard and appeared to leave him out cold.
In a scene that can only be compared with WWE superstar The Undertaker's trademark move, Fury dramatically rose up and rallied to have Wilder backpedaling at the end of the fight.
"I hope I did you all proud after nearly three years out of the ring," Fury said. "I was never going to be knocked down tonight. I showed good heart to get up. I came here tonight and I fought my heart out."

The eyes of the boxing world will be fixated on Los Angeles this Saturday when a pair of unbeaten giants square off at the Staples Center in arguably the biggest heavyweight title fight in two decades.
WBC titleholder Deontay Wilder matches his powerful right hand against the awkward craft of lineal champion Tyson Fury in a Showtime pay-per-view main event. Wilder enters the bout a slight betting favorite in Las Vegas, but never count on the always crafty Fury.
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- In This Corner with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
So which heavyweight comes out on top? We pooled the thoughts of some of boxing's biggest current names and well-known legends, including fighters who have shared the right with the combatants to get their take. 
George Foreman, two-time heavyweight champion: "I am a big fan of Deontay Wilder and I was impressed with Tyson Fury and how he avoided the big shots against Wladimir Klitschko. I can see him going 12 rounds with Wilder because of his height and reach. The great thing about this fight is that we're all talking about it. I think Wilder wins a close decision." [Showtime]
Riddick Bowe, two-time heavyweight champion: "If Wilder comes out and means business, then he should beat Fury with ease. My prediction is Wilder by knockout!" [Showtime]
Luis Ortiz, heavyweight contender (lost to Wilder): "If Fury decides he wants to dip and dive and move, then he can extend the fight. But it's all up to Wilder. If Fury decides he wants to come to the middle of the ring and fight, then it's going to be over quick. Wilder is going to catch him. Prediction: Wilder by KO." [Showtime]
David Haye, former two-division champion: "Wilder is a sharp shooter. I don't think people quite grasp how accurate and sharp he is. I sparred many rounds with him and I had to be switched on as much as I am switched on in a fight. You have to be on your game otherwise he can hit you and hurt you very fast. If I was forced to put a bet down on current form, you have to go with Deontay Wilder." [Via Elixir of Life]
Chris Arreola, heavyweight contender (lost to Wilder): "I think Wilder fighting Ortiz and now Fury back-to-back gives the fans exciting fights. I like both Wilder and Fury, but for this fight I am leaning slightly toward Wilder to win." [Showtime]
Gerald Washington, heavyweight contender (lost to Wilder): "I'm going to go with the Bomb Squad and the American. I love Tyson Fury's style and what he brings to the table. He has the class and the boxing style but I think the difference between Deontay Wilder and Klitschko is that he is going to let his hands go with the right hand. He picks his shots, he's not throwing all the time. But when he does land it, it's going to count." [Via Behind The Gloves]
Lamon Brewster, former heavyweight titleholder: "Tyson Fury hasn't fought in two and a half years. He has been inactive. Tyson Fury had a taste of money and it made him lazy and made him relax. A guy like Deontay Wilder stayed active, he's a young man. He's 222 pounds and all muscle and can punch with both hands. Deontay has nothing to prove yet he feels that he has something to prove. So a guy like Tyson Fury, what does he have to throw in his furnace to give him the fuel to try to beat a Deontay Wilder, who is hungry?" [Via Mayweather Boxing Channel]
Mike Tyson, two-time heavyweight champion: "Although Wilder's punch is strong, nothing can compare to the mental strength Fury has shown both in and out of the ring. It'll be a close call, but I think Fury's got a true fighting chance." [Showtime]
Amir Khan, welterweight contender: "Fury is taking such a massive risk fighting Wilder. I just feel like whenever it's time to pull it off, Tyson pulls it off. Everyone underestimated him against Klitschko and he went there and beat him. I know both fighters very well but one thing about Fury is his unorthodox style is going to work for him and is going to cause Wilder a lot of problems. I don't think Fury will stand there and take that one big shot from him, he will be moving from side to side. It's a hard fight to call but I lean a little bit more towards Fury on this night." [Via Seconds Out]
Anthony Joshua, unified heavyweight champion: "I need Wilder to win and that way it gives me an opportunity to fight him. As a champion, if he retains his belt, that's a fight that people have been yearning for so 2019, hopefully, is a big year for me." [Via ESPN UK]
Evander Holyfield, former four-time heavyweight champion: "It's a great fight. Fury's got a lot of skills, he's awkward and he has long arms. He has good reflexes and is a strong counter-puncher. Deontay needs to be first and he can't wait on Tyson. Tyson's always been the bigger fighter. In fighting Deontay it's the same case. If things get difficult, he's [Fury] got more experience and a lot of tricks. I think with Deontay's power, he might be able to end it early, but if Tyson can frustrate him and it goes the distance, then it could go his way." [Showtime]
Lennox Lewis, former three-time heavyweight champion: "If it goes the distance then it belongs to Tyson Fury. If it's a short fight it will belong to Deontay Wilder. This is an epic and most-unpredictable showdown. I can't wait for this fight." [Showtime]
Gerry Cooney, former heavyweight title challenger: "Deontay Wilder vs. Tyson Fury is a very interesting fight. I love Tyson Fury. I think he's a remarkable self-promoter, and he did a great job with Wladimir Klitschko, using his feints and throwing Klitschko off his game plan. Deontay is a different kind of fighter, though. Fury fights at 30 miles per hour. Deontay fights at 100 miles per hour. So, when Deontay catches Fury and gets ahold of him I think it's going to be over. I admire Fury, but I think he's barking up the wrong tree with this fight. I think the bottom line is that Deontay is a whole different type of beast. He comes in aggressive and finishes his opponents. I hate to pick, but somebody has to lose. I'm picking Deontay by knockout and I think it ends inside of four or five rounds." [Showtime]
Carl Froch, former super middleweight champion: "I don't want to dismiss Tyson Fury because he is a real tricky customer and it's going to be difficult for Wilder to connect against someone who don't want to be hit. We've seen Fury against Klitschko and Fury was fitter and a bit younger and active. Now he's inactive and has had two sparring session opponents. He has not done anything that's convincing me of late he can go in there and beat Deontay Wilder but based upon his previous performances he showed that he can go in there and not get hit and sort of mess around and be awkward and horrible. Can Wilder deal with that? We will find out." [Via IFL TV]
Chris Byrd, former heavyweight titleholder: "I don't do predictions because fighters come in injured and you never know. Deontay Wilder, in my opinion, is one of the scariest heavyweights ever. He has that puncher's chance from 1-12. But if you get a guy like Tyson Fury, we are talking about height now. He boxed Wladimir Klitschko for basically 12 rounds because you are dealing with a jab. I'm not going to count Tyson Fury out. It's an interesting matchup." [Via Mayweather Boxing Channel]
Abel Sanchez, trainer: "That's a difficult fight. I don't know what Fury has left, he has been out of the game for quite some time. He could give Deontay some trouble but if Deontay hits anyone solid with the right hand, they are going to sleep. If Fury is in shape, it's going to be a difficult fight for Deontay. I wouldn't bet on it. It's that good of a fight if Fury comes in ready." [Via Mayweather Boxing Channel]

Operating with a noticeably reduced budget in recent years despite maintaining the facade as a destination for boxing on premium cable, HBO announced Thursday it will be leaving the fight business following 2018 after 45 years.
An HBO Sports statement confirmed the initial report from The New York Times, which brought a sad end to an era in which the network brought class and high production value to the sport, which included many of the biggest pay-per-view events in history and breakthrough programming like the often duplicated "24/7" pre-fight documentary series which debuted in 2007. 
"Going forward in 2019, we will be pivoting away from programming live boxing on HBO," the statement read. "As always, we will remain open to looking at events that fit our programming mix. This could include boxing, just not for the foreseeable future. We're deeply indebted to the many courageous fighters whose careers we were privileged to cover. 
"We are a storytelling platform. The future will see unscripted series, long-form documentary films, reality programming, sports journalism, event specials and more unique standout content from HBO Sports."
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- In This Corner with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
HBO made its boxing debut with George Foreman's knockout of Joe Frazier in their Jan. 22, 1973 heavyweight championship bout and most recently produced the much-anticipated PPV rematch between Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin for the unified middleweight title. Currently, the only remaining broadcast scheduled for HBO is an Oct. 27 card at New York's Madison Square Garden headlined by a IBF middleweight title bout between Daniel Jacobs and Sergiy Derevyanchenko.
The reason for the network's departure from the sport is centered upon a decline in viewership. HBO Sports executive vice president Peter Nelson told The New York Times that boxing telecasts in 2018 averaged around 820,000 viewers for HBO, which amounts to just two percent of the total audience.
"Boxing has been part of our heritage for decades," HBO's statement read. "During that time, the sport has undergone a transformation. It is now widely available on a host of networks and streaming services. There is more boxing than ever being televised and distributed. In some cases, this programming is very good.  But from an entertainment point of view, it's not unique."
Although Showtime has presented itself to be a viable competitor over the past 25 years, there's little doubt HBO Sports had built the majority of its reputation on being boxing's broadcasting home, especially following the sport's transition off of network television. HBO was also the undisputed king for PPV events until Showtime, upon it's 2013 acquisition of Floyd Mayweather, began to level the playing field. 
The past five years saw Showtime equal and eventually eclipse HBO as boxing's premier network, thanks in large part to its relationship with Premier Boxing Champions founder Al Haymon. Last month, Showtime announced a three-year extension with PBC.
HBO's exit also comes within a calendar year that saw the broadcasting landscape dramatically shift within the sport. Fox joined Showtime in announcing deals with PBC while Top Rank left HBO to sign with ESPN, which included a recent seven-year extension which extends across the streaming platform ESPN+. Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport also made waves by signing an exclusive eight-year, $1 billion deal to promote fights in the U.S. on the fledging app DAZN, which held its debut card last Saturday featuring unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. 
The New York Times reported that of HBO's boxing announce team, which includes Max Kellerman, Roy Jones Jr. and Andre Ward, only blow-by-blow voice Jim Lampley is expected to remain with the network. There has been no word as to whether HBO will continue to produce its monthly boxing show "The Fight Game with Jim Lampley." 
The only boxing related programming scheduled for 2019 thus far on HBO is the multi-part documentary called "What's My Name? Muhammad Ali" which lists NBA star LeBron James as an executive producer. 
The news is also expected to create an intense bidding war between the network's two biggest names, Alvarez and Golovkin, who both saw their exclusive HBO deals expire with their September rematch and are expected to likely face off for a third time in 2019. 
Earlier this month, HBO declined to pick up the option on televising a light heavyweight title rematch between Eleider Alvarez and former champion Sergey Kovalev, just months after Alvarez's exciting comeback knockout aired on the network. The fight was subsequently signed by ESPN and the decision from HBO was seen as a harbinger towards Thursday's announcement.  
In terms of statistics, HBO has aired a grand total of 1,111 fights over 45 years and debuted its "Boxing After Dark" series on Feb. 3, 1996, with a memorable action fight between Marco Antonio Barrera and Kennedy McKinney. Overall, Jones and Oscar De La Hoya are tied with the most appearances fighting on HBO with 32 while Mayweather and Shane Mosley are tied for second with 27. Manny Pacquiao (24), Miguel Cotto (24), Lennox Lewis (23), Bernard Hopkins (23), Wladimir Klitschko (22) and Arturo Gatti (21) round out the top 10.

Weekend Developments 

In the end, it wasn't so much about the size difference between Errol Spence Jr. and Mikey Garcia on Saturday in their welterweight title pay-per-view bout as much it was about the skills.
Spence (25-0, 21 KOs) made the fourth defense of his IBF welterweight title with a dominant unanimous decision win in front of 47,525 fans at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, that went a long way in building his case among the pound-for-pound best in the sport.
Behind a powerful jab and a clinical effort outboxing the four-division champion Garcia (39-1, 30 KOs), who was making the move up from 135 pounds, Spence took home wide scores of 120-107 and 120-108 (twice). CBS Sports also had it 120-108 for the native of nearby Desoto, just outside of Dallas.
How dominant was the 29-year-old Spence in preventing Garcia from ever truly being in the fight? He outlanded Garcia by a margin of 345 to 75, according to CompuBox. Spence also landed 51 percent of his power shots and limited Garcia to just 18.5 percent landed overall.
"From the whole training camp, the experts like Sugar Ray Leonard felt like [Garcia] was too smart and I couldn't box [with him,]" Spence said. "You saw today I could box and move my head and do all that if I want to.
"The game is to be smart, it's a sweet science. I had the size advantage and my reach. Why not use my jab and take something away from him that he likes to do which is use his jab too?"
While Spence's power advantage certainly played a role in disciplining Garcia away from taking reckless chances, it was his mastery of distance behind a four-inch reach advantage that won him the fight.

Spence limited Garcia to just 18 jabs landed overall and never more than five in a single round. Even though the 32-year-old Garcia deserves plenty of respect for his chin in being able to go the distance and extend Spence to the 12th round for the first time in his career, he was never able to put together more than one punch at a time.
"All the credit to Errol Spence, he's a great champion," Garcia said. "He is the truth. He's for real. He put up a great fight and executed the game plan so well. He kept the distance at his favor. I wasn't able to really get my rhythm going. He did what he had to do; his reach, his height and the southpaw stance complicated things. I was trying to make adjustments but he was able to keep executing in his favor.
"He has power in the welterweight division, definitely. He is probably the strongest and has a lot of knockouts. But I was able to hold my own and felt good and felt strong. But he does have power."
Spence turned a tactical start to the fight into his personal showcase of just how well-rounded he can be. He boxed from the outside with a quick jab that he used as a weapon and worked behind feints to potshot Garcia to the body. Spence also pawed with his jab at times as a disguise for the left cross that came behind it.
The totality of punches systematically broke Garcia down. By Round 6, Spence visibly hurt Garcia with a left uppercut. But it was Round 9 where the size difference between the two looked the most evident as Spence showed off his impressive in-fighting abilities by battering Garcia from one end of the ring to the other with clean power shots.
After the round, Garcia's older brother and trainer Robert threatened to stop the fight. Garcia ultimately begged for and received one more round and came back with a more aggressive start to Round 10 that ultimately failed to blossom into anything more as Garcia relied on his defense and chin to go the distance.
"Look, my brother wanted to maybe stop the fight and doesn't want to let me get hit as much anymore," Garcia said. "I told him after Round 9 that I was fine. I tried and landed some good shots but it just wasn't enough. [Spence] could take a good punch. He probably felt the power but it just wasn't enough.
"We just went 12 rounds with a great welterweight champion. Me being a lightweight, that's respectful and I'm proud at what I was able to do. I don't know if I will stay at welterweight. I will probably come down to the lighter divisions."
Spence, who credited Garcia's toughness and willingness to fight him when the remainder of welterweight stars (including WBC champion Shawn Porter, whom he called out) did their best to avoid him, turned his attention to what's next immediately after the fight. He called current WBA secondary titleholder Manny Pacquiao up into the ring and challenged him to a fight.
"[Pacquiao] has been here before [at AT&T Stadium] and broke records here before," Spence said. "He's a legend of the sport and it would be an honor to fight him next."
The 40-year-old Pacquiao, who is fresh off a decision win over Adrien Broner on PPV, accepted the challenge, albeit it in a tone that wasn't completely convincing.
"Yeah, why not," Pacquiao said. "We can give the fans a good fight. I'm so happy to be here in Dallas and I'm hoping that I will be back here soon."

Weekend Developments 

Errol Spence Jr. is set to put his IBF welterweight championship on the line against WBC lightweight champion Mikey Garcia, who's moving up in weight for the fight inside AT&T Stadium as he aims to continue to prove he's the best fighter on the planet. And you know that when two of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world clash, it instantly becomes a monumental event for the sport that you won't want to miss, and that's exactly what we have Saturday night in Arlington, Texas. 
Spence (24-0, 21 KOs) is coming off a June 2018 victory over Carlos Ocampo in which he successfully defended his IBF title for the second consecutive time with an impressive first-round knockout. Garcia (39-0, 30 KOs), meanwhile, is taking a chance by making the move up to challenge the dominant Spence, who's considered a big welterweight to begin with. But if he can pull off the victory, hand Spence his first loss and take his IBF title in the process, then he'll firmly be stating his case as the pound-for-pound best in the world. In July 2018, Garcia retained the WBC lightweight title and claimed the IBF championship with a unanimous decision victory over Robert Easter Jr. 
Below is all the information you need to catch the big fight in Jerry World on Saturday night.

Critics have been almost universal in their stance that UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor has almost no shot of defeating former pound-for-pound king Floyd Mayweather in their Aug. 26 boxing match in Las Vegas. 
That doesn't mean bets haven't stopped coming in to sports books from those hoping for a massive upset. 
In fact, because of the amount of money coming in for McGregor (21-3 in MMA) ahead of his pro boxing debut, the 40-year-old Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) continues to become less of a betting favorite by the day. 
As of Wednesday, the latest odds from Bovada saw Mayweather, who returns from a two-year retirement to face McGregor at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas (Showtime PPV, 9 p.m. ET), as just a -450 favorite. McGregor, 29, is listed as a +325 underdog. 
When you consider that Mayweather originally opened as high as a -2250 favorite before the fight was official in November (with McGregor at +950), the constant change in odds has been staggering. On the day the fight was announced in June, Mayweather's odds went down to -800, with McGregor coming back at +500. 
According to OddsShark.com, betting Mayweather to win at the current odds provides a better value than every Mayweather fight (with the exception of the Manny Pacquiao and Canelo Alvarez fights) dating back to 2011. 
To better illustrate that point, McGregor is now less of a betting underdog than Mayweather opponents Marcos Maidana (both fights), Miguel Cotto, Zab Judah, Andre Berto and Victor Ortiz.

It's starting to feel like Floyd Mayweather is having a hard time staying retired. 
Whether it's posting videos of himself training in the gym on social media or reminding us how much the kind of purses he could still draw should he return, "Money" has kept a very public profile since earning a reported $300 million by defeating UFC champion Conor McGregor in August. 
On Monday, the former pound-for-pound king posted a live streaming video on social media in which he insisted he could make $1 billion should he decide to sign a multi-fight contract with UFC. 
"They just called me not too long ago and asked me to come back," Mayweather said. "I can come right back. If I wanted to I could come right back to the UFC. I can go fight in the Octagon. I can go do a three or four-fight deal in the Octagon and make a billion dollars. Remember I'm Floyd 'Money' Mayweather."
Mayweather, 40, opened the video by refuting rumors that he was in need of money. 
"At the end of the day, I made the most money," Mayweather said. "All that stuff, talking about how Mayweather is going to lose his money, I made smart investments. Y'all can hold your breath with that s---. Y'all can save that. Y'all want to see me fall."
Mayweather (50-0), who last week admitted to "carrying" McGregor during the early rounds before finishing him via 10th-round TKO, also addressed those who constantly reference his history with domestic violence. 
"My thing is this -- don't worry about my house, worry about your own m-----f------ house," Mayweather said. "Worry about your own m-----f------ house. Stay out of my business. Last time I checked, I ain't got no problem with getting no b----- and I definitely ain't got no problem with getting rid of them. At the end of the day, I didn't make all this money to get married. That ain't my style."

Mayweather recently embarked on a world travel tour. He visited China, where he adopted a baby panda and named it "TMT Floyd Mayweather," and discussed boxing in Russia with controversial Chechan dictator Ramzan Kadyrov.

A post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Dec 12, 2017 at 9:54pm PST
"There is only one m-----f------ GOAT and it's me," Mayweather said. "I better not hear nobody talking about this guy the GOAT over here, this guy the GOAT over here. At the end of the day, I'm the best athlete ever. You heard me? Ain't nobody do it better than me.
"I done it in the best style, I done it flashy, done it flamboyant, I done it my way, I kept 100 percent of the revenue and I'm my m------f------- boss."

Since defeating Conor McGregor in a boxing ring last year, Floyd Mayweather has continuously teased participating in a mixed martial arts fight, regularly suggesting he would take on McGregor in a rematch or set a bout with Khabib Nurmagomedov. Though many took Mayweather's MMA aspirations as a bluff, it looks like he may actually back up his talk … just not against any UFC competition.
Mayweather announced at a Sunday night press conference that he will compete for RIZIN Fighting Federation in a bout against Tenshin Nasukawa, an undefeated kickboxer. RIZIN is a Japanese promotion, and the "Super Challenge" fight between the two will take place at RIZIN 14 on Monday, Dec. 31 in Saitama, Japan.
It was not specified whether Mayweather and Nasukawa will box, kickbox or participate in MMA, though Mayweather revealed at the press conference that those details will be worked out within the coming weeks. 
Official! pic.twitter.com/sjwZDR0mM1
Nasukawa, called "perhaps the best combat sports prospect [Japan] has ever seen" in the press release for the fight, is 27-0. Turning 20 just a few months ago, he is half the age of Mayweather, 41, who has only fought once since 2015. Nasukawa has won four fights this year alone.
Mayweather, who claims to have earned $100 million from his McGregor fight, teased the bout with Nasukawa earlier Sunday by taking an Instagram photo in which he was wearing kickboxing gloves. Mayweather (50-0) has held world titles in five different weight classes and won the seven fights prior to his bout with McGregor by decision.

While some may refer to all of this as a one-time publicity stunt to be pulled during the promotion's biggest night of the year, it actually comes across as the beginning of a business relationship between the two parties -- if Sunday's press conference is any indication. 
RIZIN promoter Nobuyuki Sakakibara first alluded to the idea that some sort of partnership has formed while speaking to the media on Sunday. 
"I think my shortest answer to that is the fact that now we are aligned to achieve something together, and that is hitting a new challenge, taking a step forward to whatever wonderful thing that we can create together," Sakakibara said (via MMA Fighting). 
Mayweather would follow up by giving his best form of confirmation that there are more plans ahead in the future, and this venture into the MMA business -- whatever that may end up entailing with this initial bout -- is just the beginning. 
"Rizin has done a remarkable job with the fighters," Mayweather said. "I look forward to giving you guys entertainment come Dec. 31, but my relationship with Rizin, it doesn't stop just here. I look forward to taking this worldwide." 
There's no telling what the translation to Mayweather's explanation actually is, as we're not even aware of what variation of combat sports he'll be taking part in come New Year's Eve. But however you may view Mayweather the person, his business acumen speaks for itself, which undoubtedly has RIZIN officials optimistic. 
We're just going to have to wait and see how the events of the coming weeks unfold before we can get a better outlook of just what exactly the self-proclaimed promotional king has cooked up.

It has often been said that desperate times call for desperate measures.
When a pair of exciting and brash British super middleweights square off on Saturday in London (Showtime, 3:45 p.m. ET) -- with both badly in need of a win to retain their viability in the 168-pound title picture -- one can expect that same level of desperation to equal fireworks inside the ring at the 02 Arena. 
"It's retirement time," former two-time titleholder James DeGale said. "Whoever loses this fight is finished. It's do or die on Saturday."
While it would seem the specter of retirement entering this fight is more dire in the case of DeGale (25-2-1, 15 KOs) considering the 33-year-old has been through the wars and shown signs in recent years of decline, the future could also be in doubt for Chris Eubank Jr. should he lose in a one-sided manner.
"His retirement fight is here," DeGale said. "It's his last fight, I promise you that."
Although Eubank (27-2, 21 KOs) is just 29, the lifeless nature in which he was defeated last February by George Groves in their title bout saw Hall of Famer and broadcaster "Prince" Naseem Hamed openly call for Eubank to retire in the aftermath. 
Even Eubank's father, the flashy former two-division titleholder Chris Eubank Sr., has been candid in sharing his fears for his son's future entering this fight. 
"This is a 50/50 fight and for the first time I am petrified of what the outcome can be," the elder Eubank said. "I am petrified that Junior may not win this fight.
"My son looks at the physical aspect of boxing and, from a physical point of view, I don't think there is anyone who can stand with him. But boxing isn't just physical – it's also spiritual, and that's where Junior lacks. I don't know whether he has that."
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- State of Combat with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
The build to Saturday's card, which also features an intriguing heavyweight co-main event between unbeaten prospect Joe Joyce and former titleholder Bermane Stiverne, has featured a predictable level of vitriol between the two boxers.  
DeGale has referred to Eubank as "a diluted idiot" and has added claims that "if I can't beat Chris, that means I'm shot, that means I'm over the hill." Eubank countered by calling him a "bum," although he did agree with how much was at stake entering the fight. 
"We are both at a stage where we can't lose," Eubank said. "We are both fighting for our careers. He knows he can't handle me. He's asking himself, 'Can I survive?' And the answer is absolutely not."
Eubank, who was widely criticized for his lack of strategy against Groves, took one step further in order to show how serious he is taking the fight. For the first time in his pro career, he hired a full-time trainer in Nate Vasquez. 
"I've got a full time trainer now. For the first time in my career, I have a trainer day in and day out focusing on strategy to prepare me for what James is – a slick southpaw," Eubank said. "That's why I'm so confident. If he wants to run, we have the gameplan. If he wants to stand and swing, we have the gameplan. We have a plan for everything." 
DeGale, meanwhile, will need to prove not only to critics but to himself that a 12-round war against Badou Jack and a pair of hard-fought battles against Caleb Truax which followed haven't robbed him of his fighting prime. 
"The fear of losing is because I know what's on the line," DeGale said. "This is do or die. If I can't beat him, if I can't beat Chris Eubank Jr., I'm done."
The fact that DeGale likely should win this fight from a tactical and talent standpoint doesn't necessarily mean he will. If both men are equally desperate, there's a good chance youth will be served. 
If DeGale can channel the "Chunky" of four years ago, when impressive wins against the likes of Andre Dirrell and Lucian Bute first placed him in the conversation of rising pound-for-pound star, a fight against an athletic-yet-crude slugger like Eubank would be a much easier proposition. 
There's not guarantee, however, that "prime DeGale" will ever walk back through that door again. And when it comes to the theme of desperation that lingers over this bout, Eubank has much more to prove from the standpoint of validating his own fame with a big-time victory. 
The fact that Eubank is younger should favor him here, especially if he's able to use effective pressure to lure DeGale away from boxing and into a fight. Recreating his efforts from recent years by blindly stalking forward won't work, however. Eubank will need to show a much more mature gameplan in how he will close distance and lure DeGale into a pace he's uncomfortable with. 
Establishing the jab (and using it as a weapon) will be key for Eubank, even with the fact that DeGale is a southpaw. But it ultimately comes down to mentality for Eubank and whether he can execute a plan without getting discouraged to give him a shot at breaking down DeGale's will. 
Given Eubank's natural talent and pedigree as the son of a British legend, there's plenty of reason to believe he still has a great performance inside of him ready to come out. Although DeGale will hold advantages in categories like speed, timing and guile, he may be just faded enough to fall into a trap in which this becomes the kind of firefight that favors Eubank's power. 
Pick: Eubank via TKO10

Conor McGregor is being bet on much more frequently than Floyd Mayweather leading up to their long-anticipated showdown on Saturday night -- which you can order the Showtime PPV here if you haven't already -- but when it comes to the amount of money, Mayweather's got it by a landslide.
According to ESPN, the MGM sportsbook and William Hill's Nevada sportsbook each took massive bets on Mayweather on Thursday. The MGM bet was for $1 million on Mayweather at -550, and would net the bettor $182,000 if Mayweather wins. The other bet, which was for $1.2 million at -500, would net $240,000. The two bets are the largest reported wagers on the fight thus far.
Mayweather's odds had dipped below -500 last weekend, but have soared back up to -600 in some books because of the heavy stream of money coming in on Mayweather.
"The price is skyrocketing right now," MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood said via ESPN.
While Mayweather has so far received about one bet for every 12 on McGregor at Westgate SuperBook, 76 percent of the money is on Mayweather. As of Thursday, the average McGregor bet at Westgate was $212, but the average Mayweather bet was $8,036.
The Mayweather-McGregor fight is expected to be the most heavily bet on boxing match in history by the time it starts on Saturday, which would pass the $60 million in action that the 2015 Mayweather-Pacquiao fight took in.

Draft Strategies for Every Format 

In what is expected to be the final hurdle before a long-awaited unification fight against unbeaten WBC champion Gary Russell Jr., WBA titleholder Leo Santa Cruz returns on Saturday set on maintaining his claim as the best fighter at 126 pounds. 
Most fans will admit Santa Cruz (35-1-1, 19 KOs) won't be coming back to face a preferred opponent considering how loaded the division remains when he faces late replacement Rafael Rivera (26-2-2, 17 KOs) in the main event of a Premier Boxing Champions card (Fox, 8 p.m. ET) at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
While the 24-year-old Rivera, a native of Mexico, is considered a more dangerous foe than Santa Cruz's original opponent Miguel Flores, who pulled out last month due to an ankle injury suffered in sparring, the fight is clearly a showcase opportunity for Santa Cruz in front of a national television audience. In fact, it's the all-action welterweight co-main event between TV-friendly brawlers John Molina Jr. and Omar Figueroa Jr. that has largely grabbed the attention of hard-core fans. 
"We kept our training camp going despite the change of opponent. We always train the same no matter who the opponent is," Santa Cruz said. "We spar against fighters who have every different kind of style, because the opponent could always bring something new to the ring. My dad tells me to always be prepared for any kind of style. We are ready for whatever the opponent brings into the ring."
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- State of Combat with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
The 30-year-old Santa Cruz is fresh off an exciting decision win over Abner Mares in their rematch last June and hopes to move up in weight to 130 pounds after unifying against Russell in order to add to his growing Hall-of-Fame resume as a fighter who won titles in four different weight classes. 
"Gary Russell Jr. is the fight that I want," Santa Cruz said. "He beat me in the amateurs, but in the pros I get 12 rounds. I think that I can beat him."
The often mercurial Russell (29-1, 17 KOs) has preferred in recent memory to fight just once per year. He held off a tough effort from Joseph Diaz Jr. last May to defend his title but hurt his right hand in the process. Russell spent the rest of 2018 taking care of newborn twins, a daughter named Laila and a son named Ali. 
So Santa Cruz will be forced instead to face the rugged Rivera, who suffered consecutive defeats to then-unbeatens Diaz and Joet Gonzalez over the last 18 months.  
"I know that Rivera has fought some good opponents like Joseph Diaz and Joet Gonzalez, and he has gone the distance with them," Santa Cruz said. "He has given them tough battles. He has shown that he's a tough fighter who will leave everything in the ring.
"This isn't going to be an easy fight. Rivera is tougher than people have given him credit for in the past. It motivates me to try to be the first to knock him out. If I have the opportunity for it, I'm going for it. Most important though, is to come out of there with the victory."
When it comes to class, the pound-for-pound ranked Santa Cruz is simply at another level compared to Rivera. Look for him to pressure his younger opponent from the start but going to the body and breaking him down with activity. 
Should Rivera find some success, Santa Cruz proved in a pair of action fights against Mares and Carl Frampton that he's more than capable of using his jab to control distance and slow down the pace. What River largely has going for him is youth and toughness and he'll need both in order to see the final bell.
Pick: Santa Cruz by UD12

Although Manny Pacquiao seems to be reaching the end of boxing career as he heads into his 40s, that doesn't mean that he doesn't recognize the dangers of the sport. Pacquiao's son, Jimuel, is starting to get into boxing himself, and Pacquiao has said that he's trying to nip it in the bud.
A video surfaced of Pacquiao's son boxing, and it caught some fire. Pacquiao, however, doesn't want his son to get too committed.
"We are really discouraging him. In our home we don't have any gloves or boxing equipment," Pacquiao told ABS-CBN News. "But we have a basketball court."

"I told him I only took up boxing because we were poor. It was a way for me to support my family," Pacquiao said, who has been boxing professionally for 24 years.
Although Jimuel "really wants to" be a boxer, according to Manny, "It pains me to see him box because I know how hard it is."
Pacquiao is in the twilight of his career, and he currently serves as a senator in the Philippines. He is 61-7-2 in his illustrious boxing career, but it sounds like he won't have a hard time hanging up the gloves -- though he may struggle if his son hopes to continue the legacy.

Manny Pacquiao's July return in Australia appears to finally have a television home in the United States, one which will kick off a new direction for promoter Top Rank. 
Pacquiao's welterweight title defense against unheralded Jeff Horn on July 2 in Brisbane (July 1 in the U.S.) will air on ESPN, according to a RingTV.com report citing multiple sources. In an announcement expected next week, the card will kick off a partnership between Top Rank and ESPN/ABC featuring seven shows this year and a minimum of 18 more in 2018.
Unlike ESPN's current series with Golden Boy, which largely broadcasts young prospects in showcase bouts, the Top Rank deal would feature highly competitive title fights typically seen on the promotion's longtime premium cable partner, HBO. 
In addition to Pacquiao-Horn, ESPN is expected to broadcast a highly anticipated junior lightweight title rematch between pound-for-pound star Vasyl Lomachenko and veteran brawler Orlando Salido, who handed the two-time Olympic gold medalist his lone pro defeat. A third show in August is expected to feature unbeaten Terence Crawford in a junior welterweight title unification bout against Julius Indongo. 
It's unknown whether Top Rank is completely severing ties with HBO after 35 years, but the development is a major blow for the outlet just the same. With HBO facing budget issues for the second straight year, and with few dates available to promoters outside of pay-per-view fights, Top Rank and 85-year-old chairman Bob Arum have been forced to get creative.
"Boxing, on a global basis, is one of the biggest sports in the world," Arum told RingTV.com last month. "Unfortunately, we haven't seen that in the United States because everything is either on pay-per-view or on two premium networks [HBO and Showtime], which have a limited audience.
"For example, they did a survey at HBO. Of the 30 million subscribers, less than five percent really wanted to watch boxing. That's a million and a half households. A lot of those households will have other appointments when a fight is aired. So you're dealing with a f---ing small audience."
While the network television experiment attempted by Premier Boxing Champions over the past two years hasn't succeeded to the level mastermind Al Haymon had likely hoped, the model proved at the very least that well-matched fights can still draw big ratings. 
For example, the welterweight title unification bout in March between unbeaten Keith Thurman and Danny Garcia peaked at 5.1 million viewers on CBS. Thurman's previous bout against Shawn Porter, also on CBS, peaked at 3.94 million viewers. PBC also televised fights on ESPN, including a 2015 Leo Santa Cruz-Abner Mares featherweight bout that peaked at 1.6 million viewers. 
By comparison, only four premium cable fights which aired on either HBO or Showtime averaged more than 1 million viewers in 2016. 
Top Rank is also expected to unveil an over-the-top network similar to what WWE and UFC have done in recent years, complete with digital access to the company's 50-year fight library. ESPN will reportedly share its own massive library on the unnamed network. In addition, Top Rank will air live cards featuring up-and-coming fighters. 
Sources told RingTV.com that HBO offered an undisclosed license for the rights to broadcast Pacquaio-Horn, which Top Rank turned down. Now, with HBO rival Showtime having taken the lead as the premier network in boxing over the past year-plus, the landscape of televised boxing continues to change.

Sergey Kovalev, for the first few rounds, looked like he had improved on some of the mistakes he claimed he made seven months ago against Andre Ward in their first fight. Kovalev was landing harder and better shots on Ward, even though he didn't score a knockdown. The Russian, who said after the first fight he overtrained and ran out of gas, started to fade again in Round 6.
As the two continued to slug it out, Kovalev was noticeably slowing down. Both fighters were swinging hard and wild, boxing in the phone booth and in the clinch. Ward was doing a good job of landing body shots, but a couple of them were fairly questionable. 
So when Ward landed one in Round 8 that looked like it hurt Kovalev, it was a little surprising to see referee Tony Weeks let it go. Ward pinned Kovalev in the corner of the ring and continued his body work, again appearing to land a shot below the belt. That's when Kovalev fell in a heap on the ropes and Weeks called the fight off.
Immediately after the fight, Kovalev was seen talking to his corner claiming low blows.
"It was a low blow. It didn't hurt like I could go down on the floor, but it was a low blow," Kovalev said. "Right now, I should've continued. I didn't feel it. This is [a] fight. We are boxers. Yes, he punched me, but I didn't feel it. It didn't hurt me. I wanted to continue fighting. Why stop the fight? I want to continue and kick his ass."
He also said that he wants to get another chance against Ward, though that may take some time to put together if at all.
Kovalev looked gassed by the time Ward put him against the ropes. At one point in Round 7, Kovalev actually turned his back to Ward as if to gather himself and catch his breath.
If overtraining was the problem last time, what happened tonight? Plus, it's not like Ward wasn't doing any damage. Although he was fighting a defensive style and constantly backing away from Kovalev, Ward was doing plenty of damage to the body and utilized his counterpunches well.
Ward would not have much to gain from doing this a third time with Kovalev. It's time for The Russian to go back to the drawing board and figure out what his next move will be.

Outside of the titles at stake in their long-awaited middleweight championship fight and the opportunity for critical respect among the sport's elite, Canelo Alvarez enters Saturday's pay-per-view showdown with Gennady Golovkin with a chance to secure something much different: validation as a true Mexican legend. 
Admittedly, it's not a subject that Alvarez (49-1-1, 34 KOs), whose cards are typically close to his chest during interviews, has stated as something he'll be in pursuit of when he enters the ring at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas (HBO PPV, 8 p.m. ET). 
But after years of fighting off stigmas that he's just a pretty boy who can sell fights and absorbing criticism for hand-picking opponents while waiting the 35-year-old Golovkin (37-0, 33 KOs) out, Alvarez has a shot to firmly silence the hardcore fans who have so readily attacked his machismo. 
It's a narrative that Alvarez was supposed to have repealed by defeating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in their May PPV bout. The lifeless performance from Chavez, however, robbed a bit of the shine from Alvarez's dominant decision victory over nothing more than a punching bag. 
But by moving up in weight to face such a dangerous puncher as GGG head on, the fight offers a shot at elevating his legacy with a victory to the heights of other Mexican icons like none before it. And its apropos that he'll attempt to do so by getting past Golovkin, a gentleman boxer with destructive power who readily flaunts the "Mexican style" taught to him by trainer Abel Sanchez that was modeled after the pressure fighting of Julio Cesar Chavez Sr.
The distinction here is interesting -- part of why Alvarez, with his red-haired matinee idol looks, has failed to win over every segment of the large Mexican boxing fan base has been the fact that his fighting style hasn't mirrored that of heroes before him like Chavez. More of a thinking man's boxer who looks to counter before coming forward, the cerebral Alvarez hasn't left a wake of all-action fights and consistently destructive knockouts in his rearview mirror. 
But Golovkin has. In fact, he knocked out 23 straight opponents before his close decision win over Daniel Jacobs in March. And in the wake of Alvarez appearing like he was avoiding GGG over the past two years, Golovkin started to appear as if he was trying to take Canelo's spot as the preferred fighter south of the border by appealing to the ideals of the fan base. 
Not only did Golovkin strategically begin speaking Spanish during post-fight interviews, fans began to show up for his west coast fights wearing "Mexicans for Golovkin" t-shirts. All the while, Golovkin continued to flaunt his "Mexican style" catchphrase with his can't-resist "awe shucks" delivery of broken English. 
It's almost ironic that Alvarez's pursuit of his full birthright and inheritance as a great Mexican fighter must come by defeating a Kazakh fighter who has done a great job taking over Alvarez's corner in terms of acting the part of a traditional Mexican fighter some have wished Canelo could be. 
"This is more than a fight, it's a real Mexican fight," Golovkin said during training camp in Big Bear Lake, California. "Abel brings a Mexican style to me. I love fighting Mexican style. I love Mexican food and eat it every day. I love the Mexican tradition. I am surrounded by it. I have many Mexican friends. I have Mexican blood."
While the promotion for the fight has lacked fireworks due to the quiet and polite demeanor of both fighters, Alvarez has appeared to take a bit of umbrage with how freely Golovkin has thrown the term "Mexican style" around.
"When Golovkin or a lot of his fans refer to fighting 'Mexican style,' it is describing a style in which a fighter is gutsy, comes forward aggressively, is throwing power punches just to throw them and engages in unnecessary exchanges," Alvarez said during training camp in San Diego. "I would argue that GGG's definition of 'Mexican Style' isn't completely correct.
"If you look at all the great Mexican fighters who have become world renowned world champions like Salvador 'Chava' Sanchez, Erik 'El Terrible' Morales, Juan Manuel 'Dinamita' Marquez, and Ricardo 'Finito' Lopez just to name a few, they weren't the biggest brawlers -- they were intelligent with their boxing, were able to outclass their opponents and knew how to use their bodies to achieve their victories."
Alvarez is hoping to redefine the image of a true Mexican warrior on Saturday and by doing so, cement his status among the greatest fighters in the history of his homeland. 
"I would argue that a Mexican warrior is one that has heart, passion and fights with all he has until the very end with intuition and intelligence," Alvarez said. "A Mexican warrior will not die in the line of fire, but will cunningly be three steps ahead of his opponent. No one can teach you to be a warrior. It's something innate that unites all Mexicans -- that fire is what propels us to survive and thrive."

Lineal champion Tyson Fury sent a curveball to the heavyweight division on Monday by joining promoter Frank Warren of Queensberry Promotions in announcing a multi-year partnership with ESPN and Hall of Fame promoter Bob Arum's Top Rank. 
The 30-year-old Fury (27-0-1, 19 KOs), who is currently in negotiations for a spring rematch with unbeaten WBC champion Deontay Wilder, agreed to a deal featuring a minimum of two fights per year that will make ESPN and streaming app ESPN+ his official U.S. home. What that deal means for the prospect of an immediate Wilder rematch, however, now remains uncertain. 
Although Fury and Warren both said during Monday morning's news conference in Great Britain that a Wilder rematch is still in the plans, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical that it happens this year. Warren, who said Fury has been promised three fights in 2019 with the first targeted in May, also revealed that Wilder's team wasn't told of the ESPN ahead of it being announced. 
Big thanks to @MTKGlobal and @frankwarren_tv for getting this deal done. Now the best heavyweight on the plant has a home in 🇺🇸 @espn and a home in 🇬🇧 @btsport pic.twitter.com/lbOME1TM51
Wilder (40-0-1, 39 KOs) fights under the Premier Boxing Champions brand, which places his fights on Showtime and Fox. The 33-year-old slugger dropped Fury twice en route to a controversial split draw in their blockbuster December bout, which aired on Showtime PPV. 
"I'm delighted that Frank and Queensberry Promotions have teamed up with Top Rank to promote my fights in America," said Fury, who also re-upped with BT Sport as his exclusive television home in the U.K. as part of the deal. "With ESPN and BT Sport behind me, the biggest sports platforms in the world are now linked up with the best heavyweight in the world!"
Fury and Wilder have been in negotiations for a rematch seemingly from the moment their first fight concluded at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Rumors had swirled that a deal was close and was expected to be announced this week. In fact, a purse bid ordered by the WBC was twice postponed due to the fact that a deal was so close. 
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- State of Combat with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
The reality of Fury's new deal now makes the purse bid a potentially risky scenario for either side should they be blindly outbid for control of the television rights. While a joint PPV deal between both networks is still possible and akin to previous agreements made between HBO and Showtime for the 2002 Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson and 2015 Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fights, Wilder-Fury II isn't on the same level financially after producing just over 300,000 PPV buys. 
"Top Rank is very excited to enter into the promotional arrangement along with Queensberry Promotions for the lineal heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury," Arum said. "He is a generational heavyweight talent at the peak of his powers. We also look forward to our growing relationship with MTK Global, which represents so many world-class fighters."
The deal is a wily one for Arum, whose heavyweight stable is arguably the thinnest comparable to other major American promoters. Top Rank did, however, recently sign former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev. 
Fury captured his lineal crown by upsetting former champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. But his much-publicized downward spiral into depression, drug abuse and obesity saw him vacate his trio of world titles. 
By agreeing to face Wilder in 2018 despite being just two fights and less than a year into his comeback, Fury became a last-minute wild card to interrupt public negotiations between Wilder and unbeaten unified champion Anthony Joshua for a super fight that never was consummated. 
Previously, Fury's lack of a permanent U.S. television home made it feel like any fight was possible. Now, the idea of him even facing Joshua, who fights on the U.S. streaming app DAZN, has become more difficult to make.
"The game has changed now, ESPN are the biggest broadcasters in the U.S.," Warren said. "If [Joshua] wants to fight Tyson, they're going to have to come to us."

Draft Strategies for Every Format 

If Vasiliy Lomachenko was able to prove one thing in 2017, it's that the two-division champion is undoubtedly the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. The question left on everybody's mind remains if he can become one of the best ever and do so at multiple weight classes.
While it may seem on the surface to be a sizable leap to make, the pure talent alone of Lomachenko (10-1, 8 KOs) makes it difficult not to consider whether we are watching a truly unique and historic fighter. The two-time Olympic gold medalist from Ukraine returns Saturday in a new weight class when he moves up to 135 pounds to challenge WBA lightweight champion Jorge Linares (44-3, 27 KOs) at New York's Madison Square Garden (ESPN, 8 p.m. ET). 
Respect box? Subscribe to my podcast -- In This Corner with Brian Campbell -- where we take an in-depth look at the world of boxing each week.
There's plenty of reason to believe that the 30-year-old Lomacenko, who seeks his third world title in as many divisions in just his 12th pro fight, is entering the toughest test of his career on paper. It also comes at a perfect time considering "No Mas Chenko" has forced his last four opponents to quit on their stools in fights that were completely one-sided. 
Unlike Lomachenko's last appearance, when he forced unbeaten and pound-for-pound rated Guillermo Rigondeaux to wave the white flag after six rounds, there arean't any qualifiers needed to make this a potentially competitive matchup. In Rigondeaux's case, he was battling age (37), chronic inactivity and the fact that he was moving up two divisions. 
This time it's Lomachenko who must answer the question of whether his size and skills can adapt at a higher weight class against a fighter in Linares, 32, a Venezuelan who fights out of Japan, who has become the class of the division over the last five years. Linares is not only one of the sport's most beautiful boxers from a standpoint of speed, technique and fluid combinations, he's 13-0 since 2012 and is seeking the seventh defense of his title. 
"I always want a challenge -- always," Lomachenko said at last week's training camp media day in Oxnard, California. "At 130, we can't organize a top fight with a champion. Then, my promoter asked me about if I want to move to 135 against Jorge Linares? After two seconds I said, 'Of course I can. I can and I am ready.'"
Lomachenko's dare-to-be-great mentality has been on display since his pro debut when, after promoter Top Rank was unable to fulfill his audacious request for a title fight, he agreed to a 10-rounder against respected veteran Jose Ramirez in 2013. One fight later, he suffered his lone defeat in a featherweight title bout to Orlando Salido, which ended via controversial decision. 
But the fighter known has "Hi-Tech" only continued to swing big from there, winning a 126-pound title against Gary Russell Jr. in his third pro bout before moving up to violently knock out Roman Martinez for a junior lightweight title in his seventh fight. 
Lomachenko's early success made finding opponents extremely difficult, which fueled his necessity to rise in weight so quickly. But the dominant way in which he outclasses opponents and forces them to quit has raised the marketability of his profile, which is something Lomachenko admits has never been part of his focus.  
"I don't think about [being recognized in public by fans,]" Lomachenko said. "My legacy is to put my name in the history books in boxing. If I can't stay a superstar, I don't worry. But I need to put my name in the history books of boxing."
One thing Lomachenko's star has benefitted from is the four-year deal his promoter Top Rank signed with ESPN last August, which has brought Lomachenko's talent to the masses. He also has begun doing interviews in English, which has brought out more of his charm and natural wit.
"We finally got up to the big arena!" Lomachenko said with a hearty chuckle, referring to the fact that he twice previously headlined the smaller Theater at MSG -- including his last bout -- before agreeing to face Linares on Saturday in the full arena. 
Asked to describe just how far Lomachenko's star has come in a short time, his manager, Egis Klimas, shared a habitual scenario that comes up from their travels through airports.  
"When he comes from Ukraine and goes through the customs and a custom officer doesn't look at the passport and says, 'When is your next fight? [Makes stamping gesture.] You can go,'" Klimas said. "That means he's growing." 
Despite how much of a darling Lomachenko has become on social media -- particularly on Instagram, where his nearly 800,000 followers are treated to a glimpse of his carefree yet disciplined lifestyle -- the core of what makes him so dynamic is what happens inside the ring. 
Target practice 🎯 #LOMA pic.twitter.com/cKF3xz9lGF
Lomachenko is the kind of technical wizard who currently has no peer within the sport. No one possesses his footwork (his father and trainer, Anatoly, pushed him into ballet for boxing purposes at a young age) or even his hand speed. In fact, his 2014 victory over Russell, who was then touted as owning the quickest fists in the game, saw Lomachenko dramatically outslick and beat him to the punch. 
Touted as arguably the most talented amateur boxer in history, Lomachenko throws combinations from almost absurd angles. But it's the way his mind works in reaction to his opponent that is just as dazzling and scary. 
UFC bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw has become a regular guest and sparring partner in Lomachenko's gym and has marveled at what he has learned. 
"He's too fast, he's too elusive, his cardio is insane," Dillashaw told Fight Hub TV last month. "Just how relaxed he is. He sees every punch coming at him. When I got to spar with him, I felt like he knew what I was going to throw before I even threw it. He's just ahead of the game and some of that stuff, I don't think you can train -- I think you're just gifted with. He can see things in slow motion. 
"That's why he's getting guys to quit. He's not there when they want to hit him. He's on them when they don't want him to be on him. His work ethic is amazing."
Thank you to @VasylLomachenko and camp for allowing me to train with him and some of the best in boxing for the next two days. pic.twitter.com/tcdd3BeexU
When it comes to the prospect of making Linares his fifth straight victim to quit, it's a result that Lomachenko says isn't even on his radar. 
"I don't think about this, I don't worry about this," Lomachenko said. "I don't need this because I come in this sport to show my best skills, show my style and I do everything to win the fight and it really doesn't bother me the way that win will come." 
Yet Lomachenko does acknowledge that one of his keys to success thus far has come through keeping 10 steps ahead of his opponent, making his opponents feel like they are entering The Matrix. OK, maybe not 10 steps exactly, but you get the picture. 
"I don't know about 10 but two or three for sure," Lomachenko said with a smile, before being asked the secret to his amazing ability to anticipate. "I have two special pills -- red and blue."

Anthony Joshua may have preferred a Wembley spectacle over a U.S. debut against Jarrell "Big Baby" Miller, but that doesn't mean the latter is going to make things easy for the former Olympic gold medalist in advance of their fight.
The two boxers met on Tuesday for the first time since their June 1 bout at Madison Square Garden was announced, taking part in a pre-fight press conference. Miller had no interest in pleasantries, however, and wasted no time setting the tone against the unified heavyweight champion, shoving Joshua with both hands as soon as the fighters came face to face.

Joshua maintained his cool after the push, walking calmly back to center stage and addressing Miller, who wore sunglasses to the meeting. But the shove from "Big Baby" was hardly a surprise considering Miller's history of antics. Known for his brash personality, the former kick boxer began calling for a fight with Joshua in 2017 and crashed DAZN's introductory news conference in 2018, attempting to go after Joshua at the event in New York.
On June 1, the two will finally get their chance to square off in the ring.
A 2012 gold medalist, Joshua (22-0, 21 KOs) had originally intended to arrange a Wembley fight with Deontay Wilder, Tyson Fury or Dillian Whyte but will instead defend his  WBA, WBO and IBF world titles against Miller (23-0-1, 20 KOs).

The Big Ten is likely going to run through the state of Michigan. Whether that's Ann Arbor or East Lansing is anyone's guess. 
The Michigan Wolverines look like the best team in the conference -- and maybe the country -- 12 games into the season, amassing a perfect record while winning 10 by double digits. They have a star freshman in Ignas Brazdeikis and a future NBA player in Charles Matthews, and are the slight favorite to edge out Michigan State in our pre-conference polling results as voted on by our college basketball experts. UM arguably has the most impressive resume to date, too, with double digit wins over Villanova, North Carolina and Purdue, and a 2-0 conference start to boot.  
But the Michigan State Spartans have been no slouches themselves, garnering two first-place votes by our panel. With a 10-2 record, they have been impressive and competitive even against top-end competition in losses; their only slip-ups being to a title-contending Kansas team by 5 and a tough Louisville team on the road in OT.  
Wisconsin and Ohio State are just a tad behind the two in our voters' minds in the third slot. Wisconsin has just two losses -- to Virginia and to Marquette, the latter in OT -- and has impressed in the early portion of the season. The Badgers have an array of weapons at their disposal, most notably 6-foot-10 center Ethan Happ, a Big Ten Player of the Year candidate. D'Mitrik Trice has made a jumbo leap as well both as a scorer and distributor.  
The Buckeyes were picked to finish third by two of the voters and fifth by another. They are off to an 11-1 start, their best since the 2013-14 season.  
Still yet, there's a consensus among the college basketball experts at CBS that it's likely going to a battle in Michigan for the Big Ten crown. We took a poll of the five experts -- Gary Parrish, Matt Norlander, myself, Jerry Palm and Chip Patterson -- and three picked the Wolverines and two picked the Spartans. Below is how we picked the rest of the league to shake out, 1-14.  
Indiana's 11-2 start has been excellent. It's also possible it's a bit of fool's good. Four of the Hoosiers' last six wins have been within four points, so while they're coming ahead in most close games (save for a 73-72 loss to Arkansas), they aren't winning convincingly. The odds that they continue to win close games against better competition in the league is unlikely, and a slight regression is likely in order. 
That's not to take away from how good IU has -- and will -- be this season. The Hoosiers not only have a Frosh of the Year candidate in Romeo Langford, but a top-5 player in the league in Juwan Morgan who is playing more and more like a future NBA player by the game. Morgan's expanded his game with his 3-point shot this season, taking and making more than ever in his career, and getting buckets more efficiently than ever. The extra space Langford is drawing has done gobs of good for him -- and for IU as a team.  
Wisconsin has enjoyed a better-than-expected start to its season, notching wins over Oklahoma, Iowa and Xavier, among seven others. They rank top-20 in both offensive and defensive adjusted efficiency, according to KenPom.com, and rate well in a lot of other metrics. The ceiling for this team is still untapped. It seems like this team has a safe floor of 11 or 12 wins in league play, so stealing a win against Michigan or Michigan State -- or both -- could leave them where they've been much of this season with regards to the conference title race: better than expected.  
A trendy preseason National Player of the Year pick, Purdue's Carsen Edwards is the most obvious choice for Big Ten Player of the Year. Edwards is averaging 26.0 points, 3.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game for the 7-5 Boilermakers. He's a scoring machine who is putting up gigantic stats unlikely to be matched. Ethan Happ of Wisconsin and Kaleb Wesson of Ohio State are capable of making this an interesting race, but it's Edwards' honor to lose.  
Michigan coach John Beilein is the early favorite to win Big Ten Coach of the Year, mostly because he can't do much better than what he's done thus far. His Michigan Wolverines are a perfect 12-0, up to No. 2 in the AP Top 25, and on track to potentially win the league for the first time since 2014. Beilein's got a lot to do with that, coaching a top-5 defensive unit that ranks first nationally in steal percentage. This team feisty as hell, and has Beilein's fingerprints all over it. It's a remarkable bounceback for a coach who came up one victory shy of winning it all last April.  
Only two games into league play, there's already an early favorite to win FOTY in Michigan's Ignas Brazdeikis -- who also happens to be a dark-horse contender to win POTY. Brazdeikis is the leading scorer for the undefeated Wolverines and an all-energy guy who meshes perfectly in John Beilein's system. Indiana star Romeo Langford is perhaps the only guy capable of knocking Brazdeikis off his lead.

Players We Prioritize 

The Pac-12's national perception is already in some hot water before its league play even begins. Shaky starts in nonconference play from its flagship programs, namely Oregon, Washington, UCLA and Arizona, have slumped the league's metrics and momentum before the calendar has even flipped to 2019. 
The league members have time yet to improve upon the slow start overall, but struggles against other power programs -- UCLA is 1-4 against other power programs, and Oregon's not much better at 1-3 using those same parameters -- along with only a handful of days left until conference play, likely leaves the league playing it where it lies. And as things stand now, it's not a great position. It likely leaves the league in a spot where overall quality of wins within the conference may be slightly diminished. 
Arizona State's the only one that has been carrying water for the league ahead of league play, much as it did last season (although it came back to Earth hard in league play.) The Sun Devils are 9-2 with losses to unbeaten, top-10 Nevada and SEC X-factor Vanderbilt, and boasts the best win of any team in the league -- and maybe in the country -- with a Dec. 22 ouster of then-No. 1 Kansas. And even still, only one of the five college basketball experts polled to predict the finish of the final league standings, yours truly, has them winning the league. It's no knock on ASU, but merely an example of how enigmatic the league is overall. 
The rest of our team is split between Oregon and Washington. 
Oregon's been good when healthy, but Dana Altman hasn't had its full cupboard of weapons all season. Making matters more complicated, Bol Bol, its best player, is out indefinitely, as is key role player Kenny Wooten. Still yet, the Ducks are the most talented team in the league overall, so it's no wonder they're a trendy choice to win the conference. 
Finishing as an equally trendy pick is Washington, a program with an 8-4 record that is a bit misleading on its surface. The Huskies scheduled hard in nonference play and lost to Auburn, Minnesota, Gonzaga and Virginia, all either neutral or true road games. But Mike Hopkins and Co. have a senior-laden starting five, led by Noah Dickerson and David Crisp, and a defensive stalwart in Matisse Thybulle. Coupled with the steadily-improved presence of sophomore Jaylen Nowell, they have a case to surprise as a conference contender given their overall depth and experience. 
With Bol Bol's status in the air for an indetermined amount of time, Kenny Wooten likely out a month (and maybe a longer) and Louis King still finding his way as a contributor at the college level, this team has way more questions than answers. That makes me uneasy, and a huge reason why I went with the safe pick of Arizona State to win the league. The Ducks have talent, sure, but the injuries are piling up. All it takes is a slower-than-expected first couple weeks in conference play to work yourself behind the 8-ball. I definitely believe in the Ducks as a tournament team, but if Bol Bol doesn't get back in a hurry Oregon's going to have to restructure itself on the fly. And any team tasked with replacing a 21 and 10 player in the month of January is going to struggle. 
Utah has won 20+ games in each of its last five seasons, and finished inside the top four in four of those instances. That is a remarkably sustainable run of success. And yet among the five experts in our panel, the average predicted finish was 9.6. Look, I get that Larry Krystkowiak lost several valuable seniors and this team is remade a bit overall. But the Utes, led by senior Sedrick Barefield, sophomore Donnie Tillman and a better-than-expected freshman in Timmy Allen, have the goods to outperform our predictions. Maybe by multiple slots. 
As previously noted above, Bol Bol, Oregon's 7-foot-2 star who is averaging a cool 21.0 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game, is injured and remains indefinitely out. But our panel almost came to a consensus on him as the league's Player of the Year. Bol has missed three games with an injured left foot. At some point in the not-too-distant future, he'll slip in the POY race if he doesn't return to the court and to the same form he last played in. But we're banking on him returning soon, at which time we expect him to get back to his dynamic ways as a scorer, rim protector, and the Pac-12's best player. 
Only a handful of coaches in the country -- and zero in the middling Pac-12 -- have guided their team to a win over a No. 1 team this season. Arizona State and Bobby Hurley are in that elite company. The Sun Devils knocked off Kansas on Dec. 22, improving to 9-2 overall and likely securing a double digit win total before league play for a second straight season. Hurley's off to a great start to securing this honor. 
The Sun Devils ascended to near the top last season with their hot start, then crashed down. Hard. A similar fall could cost Hurley a shot to win this. But this Arizona State overall is more balanced, with more experience, and with a better overall talent pool than it had available last season. Yes, its start to last season -- 12-0 with wins over four top-50 teams -- was more impressive, it seems clear this season's start is likely more sustainable. If that holds true, Hurley should be guiding ASU to the postseason for a second consecutive season. 
Our panel's most popular pick for Pac-12 Player of the Year is the freshman, Bol Bol, so it's only naturally he'd take home Frosh of the Year honors, too, with this caveat: Missing 6-8 weeks -- and maybe longer -- could hurt his stock in this race overall. If his foot injury continues to linger and keeps him out, Arizona State's Luguentz Dort is the most obvious contender to steal the honor from him here.

An estimated $10 billion will be bet by Americans on the NCAA Tournament this year, according to new estimates released by The American Gaming Association. Only three percent of it, however, is expected to be wagered legally.
Which means that approximately $300 million is expected to be wagered legally through sports books in Nevada, the only state currently to allow single-game wagering.
"Our current sports betting laws are so out of touch with reality  that we're turning tens of millions of Americans into criminals for the  simple act of enjoying college basketball," Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, said.  "The failed federal ban on sports betting has created an illegal,  unregulated sports betting market that offers zero consumer protections  and generates zero revenue for state and tribal governments."
The American Gaming Association estimates that gamblers illegaly wager at least $150 billion annually on sports, due in large part because of a failed federal prohibition on single-game sports betting the the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. The act has charted new waters in wagering as gamblers use bookies, illegal offshore websites, or sports pools such as bracket pools in March Madness to quench their gambling thirsts.
It is also estimated that roughly two-thirds of states' laws make sports pools such as NCAA Tournament bracket pools illegal if money is involved. And yet, according to the Gaming Association, 10 percent of adults -- or roughly 24 million -- reported spending nearly $3 billion in the past year on basketball pools alone.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Virginia, the top seed in the ACC Tournament and widely considered a lock for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, won't be cutting the nets down in Charlotte on Saturday night. 
But instead of getting bounced by fellow top-five teams Duke or North Carolina, the Wahoos saw their efforts to repeat as tournament champions halted by Florida State in a 69-59 defeat. 
While the result is an upset (Virginia was favored by 8.5 points at tip off), Leonard Hamilton's team is no Cinderella story. With 27 wins on the year, the Seminoles already were a No. 3 seed in CBS Sports' Jerry Palm's NCAA Tournament bracket projection entering the game and are playing some of their best basketball of the year. Losing to Florida State on a neutral floor does not count as a bad loss for Virginia or anyone, but it does feed the narrative that the Wahoos are prone to falling short in the postseason.

Start a bracket pool to compete against friends or play for the chance to win a college basketball dream trip.Get in the action today!

It didn't help that Virginia was back in the building where it lost to UMBC in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament, or that for about 60 of its 80 minutes of action, the team's performance did not match the urgency or intensity of its opponent. A cool and calm Tony Bennett chatted with his team in the final 90 seconds, trailing by nine, as if trailing for nearly the entire game was part of the plan. Florida State wasn't going to be denied though, still riding the fire it showed from the opening tip. The Seminoles have a deep and athletic rotation, and they swarmed all over Virginia, forcing tough shots and winning battles on the glass. 
"They were just the tougher team tonight. More physical tonight," Virginia guard Ty Jerome said. 
Bennett continued to reiterate that theme: that Florida State brought a toughness and physicality that Virginia was not able to match. Sometimes it's good, he said, to be reminded that you can't always rely on being able to storm back and overcome deficits. Virginia has lost just six games in the last two years, so the habits this group has formed usually involve being able to overcome subpar performances and still emerge victorious. 
"These guys have been amazing all year and we have always found ways to pull it out," Bennett said. "And sometimes that's a good reminder when you can't pull it out, we got to tighten the screws in other areas and be ready. But hat's off to Florida State. That's a well-coached, good team."
A couple flat games in the ACC Tournament shouldn't be enough to totally sell your Virginia stock, and it's worth noting the Cavaliers won the conference tourney last season. Still, it's tough to blame someone for feeling uneasy in picking Virginia, knowing history's tendency to repeat itself. With that said, bracketology expert Palm says the Cavaliers' seeding should remain strong.
"Virginia's loss to Florida State means the Cavaliers will not get another shot at avenging their losses to Duke or beating North Carolina again," Palm said. "However, it will not knock them off the top line of the bracket. Virginia will still be a No. 1 seed and still be seeded ahead of Gonzaga. The overall No. 1 may be in doubt, though, based on comments from selection committee chairman Bernard Muir on CBS Sports Network this afternoon. It is possible that if Duke wins the ACC Tournament, the Blue Devils could be the overall No. 1 seed."
Florida State does not have the NBA talent of Duke, the only other team to beat Virginia this season, but it does have the length to bother the Wahoos inside in the same way Zion Williamson was able to in both of the Blue Devils' wins. If there's any blueprint to beating Virginia that we can take away from this result, it's that you need both size and the ability to penetrate and finish strong at the rim. That, and hope that somehow one of the best defensive teams in the country has an off-night. 
Virginia has only been to the Final Four twice in program history, in 1981 and 1984, and reached the Elite Eight only once (2016) in the last 20 years. The frustrations and disappointments of early tournament exits weigh heavy on a fan base that is quite ready to see the narratives be reversed. They are tired of hearing that UVA's style of basketball isn't "fun to watch" and very, very tired of hearing about UMBC. 
But it's tough to reverse narratives when they are reinforced by results like Friday night's loss.

Iowa State is going dancing once again. The Cyclones topped the Jayhawks on Saturday night in the Big 12 Championship Game to earn the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, beating Kansas 78-66. It was Iowa State's fourth Big 12 Tournament title in the last six years and first since 2017. It was the seventh straight year that either Kansas or Iowa State won the tournament crown.
Lindell Wigginton led the way for the Cyclones with 17 points and six rebounds. Marial Shayok and Michael Jacobson kicked in 15 and 14 points, respectively. Kansas went ice cold from 3-point range, shooting just 3 for 18 from distance. Dedric Lawson kicked in 18 points and eight rebounds for the Jayhawks in the losing effort.

Players We Prioritize 

Believe it or not, we've already hit the midway point of college basketball's regular season and flown right on past it. Seriously, where has the time gone?
By now most college teams have played roughly 20 games and are entering the heart of conference play. This has given us ample time to evaluate and scout the strengths and weaknesses for the upcoming 2019 NBA Draft class, to dissect and detect who is rising, who is falling, and where each prospect may slot in this summer's draft.
It's still fairly early in the evaluation process. Will Zion Williamson's remarkable leaping abilities require the NBA combine staff to buy a customized vertical jump kit? Is Ja Morant's goal to posterize the entire OVC before he turns pro? There is still plenty to learn! 
But as we head towards the home stretch of regular season play and the draft picture begins to take a semblance of a shape, I'm here to serve as your translator to make out exactly what that shape is.
So today we're breaking out my 1-75 prospect rankings (which you can view here) for the upcoming draft, with descriptions on my current top-20. This is different from a mock draft, in that NBA teams are eliminated from the ranking and team needs are not included/considered. My 1-75 is a personal evaluation of how I see the class.
Without further ado, we begin with a Duke star whose rise has been as meteoric as it has been entertaining in freshman Zion Williamson. 
PF | 6-7 | Fr
Zion Williamson has burst onto the college stage with rim-rocking dunks and stunning efficiency. He uses his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame smartly to overpower defenders on offense and gets easy buckets at or around the rim with ease. His jump shot is still a work-in-progress -- he's shooting just 27.0 percent from 3-point range -- but his positional versatility, athleticism and upside have him on the inside track to go No. 1. When you're a spin move or a dribble away from dunking it virtually every time you touch the ball, the perimeter game is simply a bonus that will come with time. 
PG | 6-3 | Soph
By now Ja Morant is no longer the mid-major sleeper draft prospect; Morant is the mid-major prospect threatening to make the biggest leap by any second-year prospect this season. What he's done this season for Murray State in leading the team in scoring and assists can't be overstated. He has an NCAA-leading assist rate of 56.0, a product of his elite passing, anticipation and vision, and possesses NBA-level athleticism that is second only to Zion Williamson in this draft. And oh, by the way, the two were once high school teammates. 
SF | 6-7 | Fr
RJ Barrett is the most productive scorer for the top-ranked Duke Blue Devils, averaging 23.9 points per game, and he's shown no fear in shouldering the load as the go-to bucket-getter. His audition for the NBA is being played across social media and ESPN on a near-nightly basis. Barrett has ideal size for an NBA guard at 6-7, and a combination of power and strength that unleashes his ability to get to the basket amidst traffic at a regular rate. He's a long-strider who can breeze by defenders with the ball, and a fairly reliable catch-and-shoot scorer off the ball. Barrett sometimes puts his head down and tries to do too much, which has led to some questionable decision-making and inefficiencies in his scoring, but his upside as a two-way player in the NBA is undeniable. Finishing at the rim and in isolation situations are areas that, with little improvement, will elevate his game to the next level.
SF | 6-8 | Fr
Considering the attention RJ Barrett and Zion Williamson attract on offense, Duke's Cameron Reddish should be thriving as an overqualified floor-spacer and 3-point shooter. But to this point, he's shot just 34.4 percent from 3-point range and 36.4 percent from the floor, numbers that don't scream top-5 pick as his talent and potential suggests. Still yet, Reddish is a phenomenal prospect. He's 6-8 with the handles of a guard, versatility of a forward, and the shot of a wing. He's going to put it all together at some point, but at Duke as a tertiary option, he's struggling to find success in his role. Reddish is plenty capable of getting to the rim and finishing, going James Harden with a dribble and stepback, and driving and dishing to create for others. Tapping into a more aggressive version of Reddish, which creeps its way onto the court from time to time, will be key to unlocking his All-Star level potential.
SG | 6-6 | Fr
Three-level scorers who fit Romeo Langford's physical profile are a dime-a-dozen in the NBA, so Langford -- who is only shooting 21.7 percent from 3-point range on the season -- is likely a top-5 pick on pure upside. He's a prolific scorer, leading Indiana with 17.6 points per game, but he has a tendency to be streaky overall. His most consistent buckets come via isolation, as he jab-steps his way to free up space in pull-ups, or off the dribble as he uses his 6-6, 215-pound frame to slice his way to the rack. He's a really smooth finisher around the rim off the bounce or as a slasher, and has super potential as a defender he hasn't yet fully realized. 
SF | 6-6 | Fr
Nassir Little came into his freshman season at UNC with high acclaim, expected to be a game-changer for the Tar Heels. But his lack of feel for the game, lack of confidence and general lack of awareness defensively -- coupled with UNC's deep frontcourt rotation -- has him playing fewer than 20 minutes per game on the season. Little is still producing at a respectable clip given his role, however, and his game is tailor-made for the NBA. At 6-6, 215 pounds, Little can play either forward spot in the NBA, a trait scouts find valuable. And while he's been somewhat of a defensive liability and his best offensive traits haven't been able to show through in college, he still has potential to be a solid scoring forward given his sheer talent and sturdy mechanics.
SG | 6-6 | Soph
There was healthy skepticism as to whether or not Jarrett Culver could acclimate himself into the No. 1 option for Texas Tech after showing himself a valuable third option as a freshman, but he's more than proven capable. Culver is averaging 18.7 points, 3.8 assists and 7.1 rebounds per game on the season, but it's beyond the numbers that explains why he's a future pro. Culver, at 6-5, 195 pounds, is an above average defender who has improved his shot mechanics and sped up his release in his second season with Tech, and projects as a multi-positional defender at the next level. All his skills project with grace to the next level.
SF | 6-9
Sekou Doumbouya projects to be the first international prospect taken in the 2019 NBA Draft. The Limoges CSP standout is a solid 6-foot-9, 230 pounds, and has the physical traits of an ideal stretch-four at the NBA level. He has a great motor, can capably defend every position, and has a smooth stroke that will allow the team he plays for to space the floor; he's going to be a consistent threat to knock down 3-pointers if teams choose to leave him open. Doumbouya just turned 18 at the end of 2018, too, and he is still growing/developing. But many who have followed him are confident he has a chance to be one of the next great French players to make it big.
PF | 6-11 | Fr
Texas just has a way of recruiting and producing NBA-quality big men. Jaxson Hayes is next in line to join the likes of Tristan Thompson, Jarrett Allen and Mo Bamba, with his rare combination of agility, defensive instincts and shot-blocking. And he's just scratching the surface: Hayes was a 6-foot, 125-pound freshman before shooting up to 6-10, 200 pounds as a senior. A late bloomer, indeed. And yet per-40, Hayes rates favorably with 7-foot big Mo Bamba, UT's one-and-done star who was drafted No. 6 overall last season.
Hayes may not possess the same upside as Bamba overall, but his rim protection, finishing around the rim and feel for the game defensively is already advanced at a level that could qualify him as a lottery pick this summer. 
SF | 6-7 | Soph
De'Andre Hunter is climbing -- and maybe among those in the lottery most likely to rise as we near the draft. He's almost certainly going to wow at the combine and test off the charts. He's improved as a 3-point scorer, finisher, rebounder and assist man in his second season with Virginia, all quality traits that serve as supplements to his lockdown-level defense. At 6-7, 225 pounds, Hunter is a physical freak who can make a profound impact immediately for an NBA team.
SG | 6-6 | Fr
The latest, but certainly not the last, one-and-done prospect from Kentucky is a name most are familiar with by now in Keldon Johnson. Johnson leads UK in scoring at 14.6 points per game, and is a high floor player who could contribute immediately with his always-hot motor and relentless energy. Johnson's is athletic and skilled with good shooting touch overall -- he's hitting 38.3 percent from 3-point range and 50.0 percent from 2-point range -- which complements his slashing style that comes natural for his athletic profile.
C | 7-2 | Fr
Oregon star Bol Bol stands at 7-2, but you wouldn't know it by the way he gracefully gets up and down the court. He's a small forward in a center's body. He made 52.0 percent of his 3-pointers with the Ducks before a season-ending injury, and proved to be dynamic not only as a shot-creator, but as a rim-protector. Still, his slender frame is a concern that makes him injury prone; he's already out for the season with a foot injury. And his defensive prowess doesn't extend past the paint, as teams will target him in pick-and-rolls. He'll be drafted on offensive upside alone.
PF | 6-8 | Jr
After picking up basketball at age 14, Gonzaga's Rui Hachimura has quickly developed into one of the best forwards in the 2019 NBA Draft. At age 20, he's 6-8, 235 pounds, and uses his physical tools to his advantage by playing with power, force and strength. When he's aggressive on offense, he's a load to stop on straight-line drives to the hoop. He's improved his 3-point stroke dramatically this season, but for his career is just 30.2 percent from distance.
PG | 6-2 | Fr
Despite a season-ending injury to his left knee in late November, Darius Garland, a freshman from Vanderbilt, is still the clear-cut No. 2 point guard in the 2019 draft class. Garland is a score-first guard with elite shot-making ability, with a dynamic pull-up game to boot. His playmaking and overall vision comes natural for him, too, a product of his high-level dribbling skills. His off-ball skills in catch-and-shoot situations may allow him to play the shooting guard in the NBA in some instances or even operate as the second ball-handler in guard-heavy lineups.
SG | 6-6 | Fr
Physically, Kevin Porter Jr. is gifted. He can play the point guard or small forward in the NBA, and at 6-6, he's capable of defending small forwards, too. He's also a natural-born scorer with the ability to score in a variety of ways. The question with Porter Jr. largely centers around consistency. At USC, he's been more hit than miss as a player, though injury could play a role in that. If he puts it all together, he can be a multi-time All-Star with his skill set and talent. If he continues to be as enigmatic an NBA player as he is as a prospect, his floor is fairly low. A true boom-or-bust prospect that likely won't slip past the teens. 
PF | 6-8 | Jr
No, that's not Brandon Clarke wearing moon shoes for Gonzaga. That's Brandon Clarke, a San Jose State transfer, naturally loading up his athleticism to consistently live above the rim for the Bulldogs. He's a super leaper who is third in the NCAA in blocks per game (3.2). Clarke naturally finishes anything in his space when the ball is around the rim. He rates top 10 in offensive rating, eFG% and true shooting percentage at KenPom, and third in the country in total PER. Translated: He does a lot of things at a really, really high level. Some team is going to see that and get a steal in the late-first or early second-round.
C | 6-11 | Soph
Coming back for a sophomore season to improve his draft stock was ultimately a wash, as he tore his ACL and MCL prior to the season. But Porter's stock is still hovering around the lottery because of his projected fit in the NBA. He's a 6-11 big man who can stretch the floor with a solid outside shot. There's a place for players like him to thrive given the direction of the league and its value on floor-spacing. He made 36.4 percent of his 3-pointers as an 18-year-old freshman at Mizzou last season. He's still really young with a ton of upside after reclassifying and moving up in 2017 to join his older brother, Michael Porter Jr.,at Mizzou.
SG | 6-5 | Soph
In his second season with the Hokies, Nickeil Alexander-Walker has been assigned a bigger role as both a scorer and distributor -- and he's delivered on all fronts.  He's averaging 18.3 points and 3.5 assists per game for Virginia Tech on the season, displaying exactly the skill set the NBA can put to use in a guard like him with his frame. He can guard 1-3 with his length and should be, at the very least, an overqualified 3-and-D player early on in his career, with an opportunity to develop into a legitimate on-ball shot creator and scorer.
SG | 6-4 | Fr
Luguentz Dort is a bowling ball of a guard who is barreling his way to baskets and into first-round consideration for his hot start to the season at Arizona State. He's a strong, physical player who, at 6-4, 215 pounds, plays above his size and consistently out-physicals and out-toughs other teams. Dort can impact the game on defense -- he averages 1.44 steals per game, seventh in the Pac-12 -- as well as on offense, where his havoc-wreaking style translates via straight-line drives and in drive-and-kick situations. He's shooting 30.7 percent from 3-point range on the season, which needs to improve for him to maximize his potential in the NBA, but his hustle and impact on both ends of the floor may reminds folks of a young Marcus Smart. Consistent energy booster on both ends of the court.
SF | 6-9 | Soph
 After a mostly unspectacular freshman season at Stanford, sophomore KZ Okpala is quickly becoming one of the most buzzed-about prospects in the Pac-12 because of his improved jump shot accuracy and versatility. The 6-9 forward is averaging 17.9 points, 0.9 steals, 0.8 blocks and 6.5 rebounds per game for the Cardinal.

Players We Prioritize 

In the same way that draft prospects are separating themselves in the  lottery discussion, so too are teams in the NBA as they barrel towards the  finish line post-All-Star Game. Even with as much ball as there is left to play, it's becoming increasingly more clear which franchises are going to enter the offseason with the best odds to win the draft lottery -- and, more specifically, the highest likelihood to have the opportunity to draft Duke star Zion Williamson. 
Whether Williamson's knee sprain, which he suffered Wednesday whilst blowing through his sneaker, allows him to return to the court this season is inconsequential (he's listed officially as "day-to-day" by Duke). Just 26 games into his collegiate career, he stands in an echelon of his own among other prospects in this class. 
So as the college hoops season fast approaches its regular season end, there's no better time than the present to check in on which franchises are expected to have the best odds to have the privilege of selecting at No. 1, which players are expected to be selected, and where. Below is our latest mock draft with the order set by SportsLine's projected final records. (Note: Basketball fit and present roster situations are taken into account, and may differ from the CBS Sports top-75 prospect rankings.)
Zion Williamson | Duke | Fr | PF | 6-7
The Suns are at a point in their rebuild where they just need to acquire the best talent. Grabbing Deandre Ayton at No. 1 overall last season to put alongside rising star Devin Booker was a step in the right direction, no question, and drafting Zion Williamson here is a no-brainer. He's the best talent in the draft, with the highest upside. Whether he's more equipped to play the small forward or the power forward in the NBA is a question for another day; he can be an instant contributor in Phoenix and has star potential to boot. 
Ja Morant | Murray St. | Soph | PG | 6-3 
RJ Barrett | Duke | Fr | SG | 6-7 
Darius Garland | Vanderbilt | Fr | PG | 6-2 
Cam Reddish | Duke | Fr | SF | 6-8
The Hawks have a core to build around with John Collins, Trae Young and Taurean Prince, and adding Cam Reddish would be yet another promising prospect to the process. Reddish has shown flashes of being a great playmaker -- he rates in the top 4 percent according to Synergy as a pick-and-roll ball handler, scoring 61 percent of the time -- and his shot mechanics are tremendous. Though he's been streaky as both a player and shooter at times this season for Duke, which hasn't been the case of late with three 22+ point outings in his last five games, his upside as a secondary playmaker would be too enticing for Atlanta to pass on here at No. 5 -- if he's still on the board.
Romeo Langford | Indiana | Fr | SG | 6-6
Nassir Little | North Carolina | Fr | SF | 6-6 
Jaxson Hayes | Texas | Fr | C | 6-11 
Jarrett Culver | Texas Tech | Soph | SG | 6-6 
Pick via Dallas: Is there such thing as too many capable off-ball guards? (Answer: No.) Even with selecting Cam Reddish early, Jarrett Culver's a player Atlanta would be hard-pressed to pass on because he does things that Reddish can't. At 6-6, Culver is capable of playing either at shooting guard or at the wing, and his defensive versatility stretches through several positions. In the NBA, where versatility and switchability is at a premium, Culver brings excellent value at No. 9 if he's still on the board.   
De'Andre Hunter | Virginia | Soph | SF | 6-7 
In terms of a ready-made skill set, De'Andre Hunter is near the tops in this draft class. His defensive capabilities are plug-and-play, and his 3-point stroke, which was already respectable as a freshman at 38.2 percent, is up to 45.5 percent as a sophomore for Virginia. Miami will love his versatility as a defender both on the perimeter on the post, and love even more his accuracy as a spot-up shooter. He doesn't have to have the ball in his hands to be effective. 
Coby White | North Carolina | Fr | PG | 6-5
Even with a buy-low flyer taken on 2017 No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz, Orlando should be looking point guard here to upgrade the position. Taking UNC frosh Coby White here is a huge swing. He's going to be a mid-to-late first-rounder on some boards, but White's imaginative offensive playmaking and scoring threat from anywhere on the court may earn him some late buzz as a climber after he shows out at the NBA combine. What he does well would be a huge addition to the Magic's rebuild. They already have some intriguing pieces, but White could be the pawn that helps meld it together. 
Keldon Johnson | Kentucky | Fr | SG | 6-6 
The Timberwolves took a bouncy wing in last year's draft, Josh Okogie, that's looking more-and-more like a steal. Still yet, despite some duplicative talent crossover between he and UK product Keldon Johnson, they shouldn't pass on him here at No. 12 if he falls this far. He's a top 10 player in this class. Johnson's an excellent spot-up shooter, hitting 40.4 percent of 3-pointers this season, and he has two-way capability with a long 6-6 frame. His energy and bounce could earn him a shot at making an instant impact with down-the-line glue guy potential. 
Bol Bol | Oregon | Fr | C | 7-2
Pick via Sacramento: Bol Bol's season was cut short due to injury -- a huge concern for a 7-2 prospect. But at some point, the risk of Bol flaming out is worth the reward that he develops into a star. His unique combination of skills as a 3-point shooting (52 percent on 25 attempts) rim protector (his block rate in 12 games was 12.5 percent, which rates in the top 10 nationally) is too tantalizing to pass on. And for Boston, which is taking Sacramento's pick at No. 13 and already loaded at virtually every position, the chance Bol becomes a star would be like stealing. 
Rui Hachimura | Gonzaga | Jr | PF | 6-8
Gonzaga's leading scorer, Rui Hachimura, has improved every season he's been in Spokane, Washington. With his improvements this season, it's looking to likely be his last given the leap he's made. He's improved from 19.2 percent as a 3-point shooter last season to 42.3 this season, and his assists and shot-making in non-3-pointers have improved, too. He won't be asked to be the same playmaker in the NBA that he is with the Zags, but he should slot comfortably into a lesser role given his improvement as a shooter. With the Lakers, he could develop into a off-bench backup for LeBron James or Kyle Kuzma, or potentially a Kuzma replacement if he gets dealt in the offseason. His floor-stretching would give L.A. the 3-point threat it desires at the forward spot. 
Sekou Doumbouya | France | SF | 6-9
While Doumbouya won't get the same attention as other college standouts, he's already been playing at the professional level for more than two years. An 18-year-old forward, his biggest selling point is his versatility -- he can guard shooting guards and big men, and is expected to be around 6-10 this summer -- as well as his threat to make outside shots. He can knock down open looks and creates plays with the ball in his hands. When he adds more weight to his still-growing frame, he'll be capable of defending the post with confidence given his sheer length.
Kevin Porter Jr. | USC | SG | 6-6
Talent isn't lacking for USC product Kevin Porter Jr.; he's a well-polished offensive product who has shown Harden-esque flashes as a shot-creator. But consistent production and effort haven't been there this season. Some nights he's the best player on the floor, some nights he's just another guy. At No. 16, though, the Nets can bet on seeing more of the former than the latter in the NBA. His off-the-dribble jumpers are a thing of beauty, and he's not afraid to mimic Harden down to the stepback-shooting ways of the Houston star; according to Synergy, 65 percent of his shots in the half court come from long distance, and he rates in the 17th percentile in that category.  
Jontay Porter | Missouri | Soph | C | 6-11 
Even a preseason knee injury won't keep Missouri's second-year star Jontay Porter from pushing lottery selection. He's too gifted. His size, skill, shot-making and rim-protection make him an ideal stretch-four/five at the next level. Porter could add another dimension to Detroit's offense with Blake Griffin that Andre Drummond cannot. 
Nickeil Alexander-Walker | Virginia Tech | Soph | SG | 6-6 
Pick via Los Angeles Clippers: Nickeil Alexander-Walker has improved in virtually every facet of his game in his second season in Blacksburg, all while taking on a significantly more prominent role in the Hokies' system. He won't be the same high-usage player in the NBA, though, which is why a fit with the Celtics makes sense. His 3-point shooting (39.5 percent) and off-ball IQ on offense as a cutter should fit perfectly as a second or third fiddle in Boston's system. Whether it's knocking down open shots as a 3-and-D player, or initiating offense as a second shot creator, he should thrive. 
KZ Okpala | Stanford | Soph | SF | 6-9 
Long, young and athletic, KZ Okpala's an intriguing wing prospect whose shot-making has improved drastically with the Cardinal in his second season. He's not quite ready to make a massive impact in the NBA -- he's only one season removed from struggling a bit overall at the college level as a scorer/decision-maker -- but at 19 the Spurs are as qualified as any to turn his prospects into peak potential. 
Brandon Clarke | Gonzaga | Jr | PF | 6-8
You know what would make Utah's defense, already a nightmare with Rudy Gobert protecting the rim, more lethal? Adding another lethal shot-blocker to the mix like Gonzaga's Brandon Clarke. Clarke's 3.04 blocks per game ranks third in the NCAA this season. What's more: His efficiency numbers are dazzling. He's averaging 16.7 points and 8.2 rebounds per game while shooting 68.7 percent, the highest percentage at the Division I level this season and the 11th highest since at least 1992-1993. He's a fluid athlete who moves really well for his size, and won't be the victim often of pick-and-roll targeting in the NBA. The Jazz could play him alongside Gobert and not have to worry about Clarke's mobility in the same way as Derrick Favors. 
Luguentz Dort | Arizona State | Fr | SG | 6-4
Pick via Houston: Luguentz Dort's trending downward in the New Year -- as is Arizona State -- but he's already shown himself worthy of first-round inclusion. One knock/observation is that he doesn't do one particular thing at an elite level, but his straight line drives are nightmareish to defend, his hustle reminds of Marcus Smart, and his physical profile and build is idyllic. Unfortunately, his 3-point shot resembles that of Smart, too, and his ball-handling skills are a work-in-progress; he will need to improve significantly in both areas to validate a first-round selection. But the offense he's capable of generating as a pick-and-roll ball-handler rate inside the top-third of Division I, according to Synergy, and his off-cut scoring numbers, albeit small (accounting for less than 6 percent of his total offense) suggests he can operate in the NBA as an off-ball shooting guard despite his below average 3-point numbers. Cleveland could draft him with the hope that he can develop into another promising defender alongside Collin Sexton, who has shown flashes in his first season with the Cavs. 
PJ Washington | Kentucky | Soph | PF | 6-8
Portland's offensive system centers around Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum generating the majority of its offense. But for as good as both are, the Trail Blazers are still middle of the pack in the NBA in 3-point shots, both in number taken and in shots made. PJ Washington would add another dimension to that to help them embrace the 3-point revolution, as he's shooting 43.9 percent from distance this season. He's not just a stretch-four, either -- though Portland could certainly use him in that way. His physicality as a rebounder and lateral agility as a defender could provide endless value on both ends of the floor. 
Tyler Herro | Kentucky | Freshman | SG | 6-5
The Thunder are 17th in the NBA in 3-point shots taken per game, and 19th in 3-point shots made. It's one of their biggest flaws; Paul George making 41 percent this season is the only thing keeping them afloat. Drafting Tyler Herro would be an immediate booster to that end. He's hitting 35.2 percent from deep this season, but his numbers are up quite a bit around 45 percent over the last month. Herro is a very good spot-up shooter, and with Russell Westbrook sinking defenses using his penetrating drives, he'd have plenty of open looks in OKC to knock down. Just ask Terrance Ferguson, whose shooting is up to 38.3 percent from deep this season. 
Grant Williams | Tennessee | Junior | PF | 6-7
The best player in the SEC doesn't hail from Kentucky. No, the best player in the SEC (for the past two seasons) is  Tennessee's very own Grant Williams. Williams has taken a huge leap in his junior season to expand his perimeter game -- shooting 34.4 from 3-point range compared to 12 percent last season -- which might be the final step in his development. He's still not taking a lot of outside shots, which in part could be because of the Vols' offensive system, but his skills are enough to be worth a late-first flyer for Boston. What he lacks in athleticism he makes up for in IQ and pure talent. 
Tre Jones | Duke | Fr | PG | 6-2
The worst-kept secret in the NBA is no secret at all, really: Philly needs a backup point guard like a cheesesteak needs mushroom caps. Beyond Ben Simmons, the 76ers just don't have a capable-enough player who can play both ends of the floor. Duke's Tre Jones is more than capable; he's second in the NCAA in assist-to-turnover ratio, and a tenacious on-ball defender who won't get his minutes swallowed up because of his defensive liabilities. He isn't the exciting scorer Philly thought it was getting last season with Fultz, but he's as sure-handed as they come. 
Talen Horton-Tucker | Iowa State | Fr | SF | 6-4
On a team that includes several fascinating NBA prospects, among them Lindell Wigginton and Tyrese Haliburton, Talen Horton-Tucker stands above because of his sturdy frame and size. For a guard to stand at 6-4 is one thing, but for a guard to weigh around 240 pounds is another. He's huge. That size allows him to play the shooting guard, small forward or power forward at Iowa State, mostly more of the latter. And while a 6-4 power forward in the NBA is unlikely, his build should allow him to guard at least two positions in the NBA. On a Pacers team featuring Darren Collison, Tyreke Evans and Bojan Bogdanovic (and soon to be featuring Victor Oladipo when he gets healthy next season), Horton-Tucker could fit as a secondary ball-handler. 
Eric Paschall | Villanova | Sr | 6-8
Pick via Denver: The Nets are one of the most fascinating young teams in the NBA. Led by All-Star D'Angelo Russell, they have a cupboard of rising stars in Jarrett Allen, Caris Lavert, Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie. If there's a position to upgrade, though, it's probably at power forward; DeMarre Carroll is in the final year of his deal, and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson probably isn't a long-term fix. Villanova's Eric Paschall fits the bill as someone Brooklyn could utilize. He's developed a trustworthy shot at Villanova, shooting 37.4 percent from 3-point range this season, and he's a big body who wields it well to carve out space for rebounds. He and Jarrett Allen could make for a nice tandem in the Nets' frontcourt. 
Daniel Gafford | Arkansas | Soph | C | 6-11
Pick via Toronto: Davis Bertans' coupling with LaMarcus Aldridge has been really good for the Spurs' frontcourt this season, but they draft a reliable backup for both at 28 by nabbing Arkansas big Daniel Gafford. Gafford isn't the scoring center Aldridge is -- at least not yet -- but he brings some unreal athleticism and energy to the table that San Antonio could put to use. The Spurs could view him as a developmental piece with tremendous upside; he just turned 20, and is already one of the top big men prospects in the SEC.
Ayo Dosunmu | Illinois | Fr | PG | 6-5
What does a team that has it all *really* need? If Kevin Durant bolts for New York, the forward spot could be a priority. If Demarcus Cousins leaves after this season, as expected, the center position could be more important to address. But as things stand now, the point guard position could use an interjection of talent. With Shaun Livingston's numbers slowly trailing off, the Warriors look to the future with Illinois star Ayo Dosunmu at 29th overall. Dosunmu is a score-first point guard who is quick, and he uses that to his advantage. He runs transition hard, and gets to the basket in a flash. His perimeter game and decision-making will take some time to develop into starting point guard caliber in the NBA, but with a Hall of Famer in Stephen Curry to learn from, he could have time to develop as a second unit facilitator. 
Ty Jerome | Virginia | Jr | PG | 6-5
Eric Bledsoe is playing at really, really high level for the Bucks -- but he's also in a contract year. Can he sustain it? Do the Bucks want him back? Can they afford to bring him back? All questions the front office will have to answer that we don't know right now. But whether or not he returns or not, it seems the position could use depth, especially with George Hill approaching the wrong side of his 30s. In Virginia's Ty Jerome, they get an excellent shooter, great decision-maker, and solid distributor to run the second unit. According to Synergy, he scores 1.4 points per possession in spot-up situations (top 1 percent of Division I), and 1.11 points per possession peeling off screens to score (which rates inside the top 21 percent). Jerome has a chance to make a similar impact that Landry Shamet has made in his first season in the league.

Weekend Developments 

The only commentary that made Pac-12 basketball watchable all season was that of Bill Walton, and as of Friday, it seems he has already reached his postseason peak just in time for March.
Friday night, Walton called the Oregon-Arizona State game in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals, and he was all over the place on the broadcast. From his imitation of a duck to whipping out "The Sprinkler" dance live on air, he left no entertainment stone unturned. 
Bill Walton quacking pic.twitter.com/RVmGLrknQY
Most entertaining of all, perhaps, was Walton's in-game potty break. Because of how he timed it, he missed the tip of overtime and was caught walking back to his spot on the baseline mid-possession. He arrived just in time to deliver a booming, "Throw it down, big man!" call after an alley-oop was delivered in the opening seconds.

God bless Dave Pasch for dealing with this dozens of times per season. Walton's the entertainment people tune in for, but Pasch deserves a raise for dealing with the unpredictability that is Walton on dozens of occasions each season.

Oregon will go dancing again. The No. 6 seed Ducks will be in the NCAA Tournament for the sixth time in seven years after defeating No. 1 seed Washington in the Pac-12 Championship. Junior guard Payton Pritchard led the way for the Ducks. He had 20 points, seven assists and six rebounds in the 68-48 win.
Before Saturday's games Jerry Palm projected Washington will be a No. 10 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Oregon was not projected to be in the tournament before winning the title.

Live Mock Draft! 

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will be playing in his ninth Super Bowl on Sunday night when his team takes on the Los Angeles Rams, and there are endless prop bets tied to him, his team, the announcers -- you name it. But how many are tied to college basketball?
I'm proud to tell you there's at least two!
Here's the first, which is tied to Duke star Zion Williamson.
Zion Williamson's total points and rebounds on Feb. 2, 2019 in Duke vs. St. John's  
-140
Total Tom Brady pass completions on Feb. 3, 2019 against the Rams  
+110
That's a tough one, right?
OK, OK, here's some context. I won't steer you one way or another, but I think the #math might. In Brady's eight previous Super Bowl appearances, he has averaged 29.375 completions, including a 43-completion win against Atlanta in Super Bowl LI two appearances ago. And since the turn of the decade (which includes four Super Bowl appearances), his average final completion tally is 33.75. That's up there.
So how about Zion? I'm glad you asked! In 20 games this season, the projected No. 1 overall pick of the 2019 NBA Draft is averaging a cool 22.0 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. If you take his averages for the prop bet (points and rebounds), he's averaging 31.2. 
Where this gets interesting is that Williamson has been playing like he's from another planet the last two weeks. In his last five games, he's averaged 27 points and 8.4 rebounds as Duke has gone 4-1 during that stretch. Factor in that Duke is playing at home Saturday, where he's played at a remarkably high level, and, well .... 
Here's the second one, again, tied to Duke.
Zion Williamson, RJ Barrett, Cam Reddish total points on Feb. 2 vs. St. John's  
-115
Rams and Patriots total points on Feb. 3
-115
This is a way tougher call (which explains why the odds are split 50-50). Here's the math: Williamson, Barrett and Reddish, this season, are averaging a combined 58.3 points per game. The Rams and Pats are averaging this season a combined 60.1 points per game (the Rams at 32.9 and the Pats at 27.2, both of which rank in the top 5 in the NFL). In the playoffs, the Rams are averaging 28 and the Patriots are averaging 39 (!); the Rams are giving up 22.5 in the playoffs and the Patriots are giving up 29.5.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP)  Fletcher McGee scored 20 points and was one of four Terriers to made four 3-pointers as Southern Conference leader Wofford rolled to its 10th straight victory, beating The Citadel 99-61 on Saturday.
Also making four 3-pointers were Tray Hollowell with 13 points and Storm Murphy and Nathan Hoover with 12 points each. The Terriers made a season-high 20 of 33 3-point attempts for 61 percent. They were 13 of 23 inside the arc.
Wofford's 10-game win streak is its longest since the 2009-10 squad won 13 straight.
Murphy hit a 3-pointer 13 seconds into the game and the Terriers led the entire way, going up by as many as 24 in the first half, which ended 45-26. The Bulldogs only got as close as 15 in the second half.
Lew Stallworth scored 22 points on 10-of-15 shooting for The Citadel (10-12, 2-9), which has lost 10 of its last 11. Zane Najdawi added 13 points.

MOSCOW, Idaho (AP)  Andre Adams had 23 points and 14 rebounds, both career highs, Monday night to help Southern Utah beat Idaho 75-64 and snap a three-game losing streak.
Adams, a junior transfer from Arizona State, made all his nine field-goal attempts and hit 5 of 6 from the free-throw line. Dre Marin and Harrison Butler had 14 points apiece and Cameron Oluyitan scored 12 for Southern Utah (10-10, 5-6 Big Sky Conference). Butler, a freshman, added eight rebounds and a season-high four steals.
Brandon Better hit a 3-pointer to make it 13-11 and the Thunderbirds led the rest of the way. They took a 44-32 lead into the break and Idaho trailed by at least seven points throughout the second half.
Cameron Tyson led the Vandals with 20 points, including six 3-pointers. Idaho (4-17, 1-9) has lost seven in a row and 13 of 14.
Southern Utah committed a season-low seven turnovers.

STORRS, Conn. (AP)  UConn cruised past another mid-major opponent, but with an effort that did not please coach Dan Hurley.
Jalen Adams and Christian Vital each scored 19 points and the Huskies beat UMass Lowell 97-75 on Tuesday night.
Alterique Gilbert and Josh Carlton added 15 points each for UConn (6-1), which won its third straight, all home wins over lesser competition.
Obadiah Noel had 20 points for UMass Lowell (4-5), which was able to cut a 23-point Husky lead to 10 by halftime.
Vital had 17 points in the first half, hitting six of his first eight shots, including four 3-pointers.  The Huskies built a 32-9 lead after a short jumper by Kassoum Yakwe, before Lowell began chipping away.
A turnover by Vital led to a layup by Allin Blunt at the other end capped a 10-2 run that cut the deficit to 42-32.  It was 44-34 at the half.
Hurley said it was apparent the Huskies lost the appropriate respect for their opponent and with it, the team's focus.
''We start getting out of position a foot, two feet,'' he said. ''Our rotations, our closeouts get sloppy. We lose our integrity and we just become irresponsible. That's just a sign of a team that's not used to winning.''
The Huskies refocused after intermission.
Adam's pushed the lead to 13 on a traditional 3-point play to open the second half. A 3-pointer by Gilbert made it 75-53 with just under 10 minutes left and UConn cruised to the finish.
''We're supposed to be winning these games,'' said Vital. ''You come to UConn, you don't expect to lose that much. We're winning now, so we just need to keep it up.''
BIG PICTURE
UConn: Sidney Wilson made his long-awaited debut for the Huskies with just under nine minutes left in the game. The 6-foot-7 forward transferred from St. John's after spending just part the summer of 2017 at the New York school. The NCAA denied his waiver request, forcing him to sit out last season.  UConn suspended him for the start of this season for an unspecified violation of university policy that occurred last year.  He had three rebounds, a turnover and missed a dunk in just under five minutes on the floor.
''It was Sid's first seconds in college basketball, first minutes in college basketball,'' Vital said. ''Once he starts understanding and gets his feel back for playing in games, you all are going to see a Sid you haven't seen before, I promise you that,'' Vital said.
UMass Lowell: The River Hawks were held seven points and five rebounds below their season averages.  They also turned the ball over 19 times, leading to 24 UConn points.
''We fought back a couple of times,'' said coach Pat Duquette. ''They're just able to extend the lead so quickly and so easily.''
DEFENSIVE STRUGGLES
UMass Lowell hit just two of its first 11 shots, but finished shooting 49 percent from the floor, including 10 of 24 from 3-point range.
''In the end, I just thought it was a dreadful defensive performance,'' Hurley said. ''If we don't get better at that end quickly, we're going to be in deep trouble beginning on Sunday, if we guard at that level.''
THE DOWN LOW
Carlton has now had three games this season of 15 points or better for the Huskies.  UConn's big man also had seven rebounds and three blocked shots on Tuesday. The Huskies outscored Lowell 54-24 in the paint and outrebounded the River Hawks 40-32.
''Having games like this really helps my confidence,'' Carlton said. ''I think we can keep this going.''
UP NEXT
UConn: The Huskies host Arizona in what coach Hurley calls a high-leverage game on Sunday at the XL Center in Hartford.
UMass Lowell: The River Hawks host NJIT on Saturday at the Tsongas Center.

FLORENCE, Ala. (AP)  Christian Agnew hit a half-court shot as time ran out to give North Alabama a 63-62 victory over Stetson on Saturday.
After Stetson's Kenny Aninye missed two free throws with 5.7 seconds left, Agnew got the rebound before making a bank shot a few strides behind the half-court line. Until that shot, Agnew had just two points on 1-of-9 shooting, having missed his three previous 3-point attempts.
Kendarius Smith, who lost the ball out of bounds as he raced up court then gave up his fifth foul to send Aninye to the line, finished with 15 points for the Lions (7-13, 4-1 Atlantic Sun), who won their fourth straight.  Freshman Emanuel Littles grabbed a career-best 18 rebounds and scored 11 points while Tavon King added 14 points and Kendall Stafford 10.
Marques Sumner scored 14 points and Aninye 10 for the Hatters (4-15, 0-4), who lost their fourth straight and are still looking for their first road win.

BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP)  Most players search for motivation when playing opponents they should beat, but Ahmed Hill didn't need to look very far for his.
Actually, he only needed to watch film of his last game.
Coming off a scoreless performance against Penn State, Hill scored 24 points to lead No. 13 Virginia Tech to a 94-40 win over Central Connecticut State on Saturday.
Looking like a totally different player than the one who took the court Tuesday against the Nittany Lions - he missed all six of his field-goal attempts in 38 minutes - Hill connected on 9 of 13 from the floor Saturday and tied a career high with six 3-pointers. Behind his stellar play, the Hokies (6-1) rebounded from a 63-62 loss to the Nittany Lions in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge.
''I was very motivated,'' Hill said. ''I just knew people would think that it was like last year, how if I was down in confidence, I wouldn't play wel. But I'm kind of over that this year. I just go game by game and moment by moment.''
Hill's game was part of a record-setting evening for the Hokies, who set a school record by making 18 3-pointers against the Blue Devils (4-5). Virginia Tech made 18 of 33 from beyond the arc (54.5 percent).
Kerry Blackshear Jr. added 18 points for Virginia Tech, hitting a couple of 3-pointers, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Ty Outlaw each hit three 3-pointers en route to double-figure evenings. Outlaw finished with 15 points, while Alexander-Walker added 14 for the Hokies, who responded to their first defeat of the season by shooting 57.1 percent (36 of 63).
''I don't think that we were great at Penn State,'' Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams said. ''I hope that we learn from it, similar to how we played against St. Louis last year (a 77-71 loss). It was just blase. It was not enough juice. It was not enough energy. It was not enough toughness. I think the response of our program in what you saw today was maybe trying to get back to the core of what you have to be about. I thought we did that.''
Virginia Tech's torrid shooting buried CCSU right from the start. The Hokies made 11 of their first 13 shots, including five 3s. Getting seven points from Blackshear, Tech used an 18-2 run to build a 15-point lead within the first eight minutes of the game and led 49-23 at halftime.
Playing its second game in three nights, CCSU never got untracked. The Blue Devils got a 3-pointer from Ian Krishnan to open the game, but made just eight of their final 26 shots in the first half and trailed for all but a minute in the game.
Joe Hugley led the Blue Devils with 13 points. They only shot 25.9 percent (14 of 54).
TIP-INS
Central Connecticut State: The Blue Devils, picked to finish sixth in the Northeast Conference, have some interesting pieces, but will need to keep guard Tyler Kohl on the floor for a longer stretch than Saturday. Kohl was ejected with 7:37 left in the first half after committing a flagrant 2 foul. Averaging 20 points per game entering the day, he did not score, missing all four of his attempts from the floor.
Virginia Tech: How good is Virginia Tech's perimeter talent? They have hit at least 10 3-pointers in six of seven games this season. Point guard Justin Robinson, who was averaging 16.2 points per game, scored only four against the Blue Devils but set a school record with 13 assists.
ROBINSON RESPONDS OFF THE BENCH
Robinson had started 81 consecutive games before Williams elected to bring Robinson off the bench Saturday. The senior led Tech with 19 points in the loss at Penn State, but he turned the ball over six times and had just one assist. Against CCSU, he had the 13 assists and also grabbed seven rebounds.
''I played really selfish against Penn State,'' Robinson said. ''I wasn't myself. I was out of my lane. I just think, overall, if I have a game of one assist and six turnovers, it's hard to overcome, being the leader and the floor general.
''The decision to come off the bench was coach's decision. I trust him with whatever he decides. I just went along with it and came off the bench and tried to give us energy whenever I went into the game.''
UP NEXT
Central Connecticut State: The Blue Devils return to action next Saturday when they play a home game against Penn State-Wilkes-Barre.
Virginia Tech: The Hokies take on VMI on Wednesday in the second of three straight nonconference home games.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP)  Lavelle Scottie scored 22 points and grabbed seven rebounds, Chris Joyce scored a go-ahead jumper, and Air Force pulled away late to beat Boise State 74-60 on Tuesday night for the Broncos' third straight loss.
A.J. Walker scored 18 points with six boards and four assists and Joyce added 12 points and seven rebounds for the Falcons (8-11, 3-4 Mountain West Conference), who outrebounded the Broncos 41-22 and outshot them 54 percent to 36 percent.
Joyce's jumper broke open back-and-forth play for a 44-42 Air Force lead and the Falcons led by as many as six, but Boise State closed to 53-52 on Zach Haney's layup with 7:06 left.

MOSCOW, Idaho (AP)  Trevon Allen tossed in 25 points, matching his career high, and Idaho jumped out to a big first-half lead and hung on for a 74-71 victory over Eastern Washington on Thursday night.
Allen sank 9 of 17 shots, including 3 of 4 from 3-point range, for the Vandals (4-10, 1-2 Big Sky Conference). Chance Garvin added 11 points and freshman Cameron Tyson scored 10 for Idaho. The Vandals shot 58 percent from the floor in the first half, including 9 of 12 (75 percent) from 3-point range, and took a 43-23 lead at intermission.
The Vandals stayed in front by double digits until Ty Gibson's 3-pointer with 3:29 left pulled the Eagles (3-11, 1-2) within 70-61. Tyler Kidd had a steal and a layup to cut the Eagles' deficit to six and his 3-pointer with 54 seconds left pulled the Eagles within 73-68. Allen stepped to the line with a chance to set a career scoring high, but he missed the second of two free throws and Jesse Hunt followed with a 3 to get the Eagles within 74-71. Mason Peatling missed a 3-point shot for Eastern with five seconds left and a chance to send the game to overtime.
Peatling led EWU with 17 points, Hunt scored 14 and Cody Benzel added 10 points. Benzel hit back-to-back 3s to give Eastern an early 16-9 lead, but Garvin, Allen, Khadim Samb and Gibson all sank 3s in a 12-0 run and Idaho never trailed again.

Weekend Developments 

BOISE, Idaho (AP)  Ehab Amin came off the bench to score 23 points and grab a team-high six rebounds to lead Oregon past Boise State 62-50 on Saturday night.
Oregon (9-4), which beat the Broncos 66-54 on Dec. 15, completed a sweep of the rare home-and-home nonconference series with the Broncos and did it with only eight scholarship players.
''This win was important,'' Oregon coach Dana Altman said. ''We needed a win like this. We've been through a lot of ups and downs with injuries and new guys, but we need to keep pressing forward. There are a lot of great opportunities ahead for this them.''
Boise State (5-8), which lost at home for the only the second time this season, focused successfully on stopping Oregon's Payton Pritchard, who had 19 points in the matchup earlier this season. Pritchard finished with only three points, but Amin was the one victimizing the Broncos.
''We did a great job on Pritchard, that was a big part of our game plan,'' Boise State coach Leon Rice said. ''But it's not like we said we're going to double-team Pritchard. We just didn't make it tough enough on Amin, too.''
Amin, a graduate transfer from Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, had scored just 21 points in his previous nine games combined.
''We just started hitting a lot more jumpers and that opened things up for me,'' Amin said. ''Then we just started spreading it around. I was just taking what the defense was giving me.''
Oregon used a 13-2 run to build a 34-28 lead and, after Boise State briefly took a one-point lead, Amin took over. Amin scored six straight points to give Oregon a 46-37 lead with eight minutes left and all but put the game away.
Paul White added 13 points for Oregon, while Pat Dembley paced Boise State with 13.
BIG PICTURE
Oregon found a way to win on the road while missing two starters and one key bench player, something that will serve the Ducks well as they enter Pac-12 play next week. And the Ducks aren't sure when they'll return to full strength.
Bol Bol, a 7-foot-2 freshman who leads the team in scoring (21.0 points per game), rebounding (9.6) and blocks (2.7), has missed the past four games with a foot injury and out indefinitely. Starting forward Kenny Wooten broke his jaw against Baylor and is expected to be out for another five to six weeks. Forward Abu Kigab, who missed the past three games with a sprained foot, may return to action next Saturday.
Boise State has struggled this season and let a chance to steal one from the Ducks slip through its fingers. However, the Broncos have been competitive in all their losses, which have included several solid mid-major teams and Oregon.
If the Broncos end up making some noise in the Mountain West Conference this season, they will be able to point back to their character-building nonconference slate as the reason why. Otherwise, it's likely to simply be a long season.

Speaking publicly Saturday for the first time since he struck and killed a pedestrian in a traffic accident, an emotional Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim expressed deep sympathy to the family of 51-year-old Jorge Jimenez, who died Wednesday.
"First and foremost, to the the Jimenez  family,  I want them to know how truly devastated I am for my involvement in the loss of their loved one, Jorge Jiminez," Boeheim said.
Boeheim made his comments in his postgame news conference following the Orange's 75-65 loss to No. 1 Duke at the Carrier Dome.   
"This is something that will be with me for the rest of my life," Boeheim said. "There's nothing like this when a human life is lost and you are there. I can't describe it to you."  
When Boeheim walked onto the court of the Carrier Dome, he received a warm welcome. Boeheim and the Orange beat Duke earlier this season at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, and they took a 5-point lead into halftime before falling to the Blue Devils.
"My decision to coach this game, I felt the responsibility and obligation to my players, the members of my basketball team," Boeheim said. "I recruited these young men to come play at Syracuse University, they needed me to try to do my job tonight, and they understand I did this feeling fully the weight of the tragic accident and its impact on the Jimenez family."
Earlier Saturday, Syracuse held a moment of silence before its game against the Blue Devils to honor the man killed Wednesday night in an accident involving Boeheim.
Jimenez was walking on Interstate 690 when he was struck by Boeheim's car. The car he was a passenger in had lost control and struck a guardrail moments earlier, police say. 
The crowd went silent to honor Jimenez before the game.

Syracuse (18-9, 9-5 ACC) faces North Carolina on Tuesday. Boeheim said that, in the wake of the tragedy, it will take him much longer to recover than before then. 
"This is never going away," he said. "Tuesday, it's not going to be better. It's not going to be better next month. It's not going to be better next year."

Oncoming problem for sportswriters across this great nation: the English language does not have a deep enough supply of adjectives to continually introduce new ways of depicting Trae Young.
Oklahoma's freshman wonder did it again Saturday, which is to say he looked like the best player in the sport; which is to say he lengthened his laughably comfortable lead for national player of the year honors; which is to say that Young is proving incapable of truly having a bad game. Against 16th-ranked TCU, Young drove No. 9 Oklahoma to a 102-97 overtime victory while matching his career high of 43 points. Young was 10 of 18 on 3-pointers and also had a career-high 11 rebounds, plus seven assists (and nine turnovers). 
According to ESPN's research, no other player from a "major conference" in the previous two decades has had a game with at least 40 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 3s in one game. This sort of ludicrousness is what Young is pulling off almost every game. Since late November, no matter the opponent, there's almost always a school or in-season record Young is providing. Young's 10 3-pointers were one shy of the school's single-game record.
He'll probably break that by next week. 
His nine double-doubles are the most in the Big 12 this season. 
A triple-double feels inevitable. 
Saturday's win got Young to 160 assists this season. It's already a freshman program record.
In the grander scheme, Young is chasing the unprecedented: No player has ever led the nation in points and assists. At 30.1 points and 9.9 assists per, he's still in command of both categories. But while it's easy -- and warranted -- to make every Sooners win about Young, the reality is Oklahoma is the highest-scoring team in college basketball. Young's facilitating that, but there's a lot of scoring talent around him. 
Let's pinpoint some evidence on this. Take a look at this critical play near the end of regulation, the play that gave Oklahoma the lead. Young dips into the mid-range, and you see four Frogs instinctually drift toward him. Junior shooting guard Christian James emerges on the weak-side wing. Young sends the ball to him, and bang. It's 89-87. 
Trae Young to Christian James and Oklahoma takes the lead over TCU. What a game pic.twitter.com/TCcgApmgB7
James, by the way, averages 13 points. He's the Sooners' not-so-secret weapon. Oklahoma dumped a program-record 19 treys on TCU, doing it at a 58-percent clip. 
This Sooners win got the team to 14-2, with a 4-1 mark in the league. OU is now tied with Kansas, West Virginia and Texas Tech atop the league standings. No one has any idea who the best team in this conference is right now, but it's safe to dub all four of those teams Final Four threats. Yes, Oklahoma. Specifically Oklahoma! The Sooners' offensive and Young's transcendent shooting ability puts the Sooners on a plane for themselves. 
Saturday's win marked Oklahoma's fifth victory this season over a ranked opponent -- as many as any team in college hoops.
What's fascinating about Oklahoma at this point is it's not yet a top-10 team in points per possession. But because Oklahoma is playing 78 possessions per game (third most in the sport), and because Young has zip-code range, the Sooners are not only a threat to win any game, but they're also impossible to turn off even when they slip into rare deficits. 
Oklahoma's hit the century mark six times this season, matching Gonzaga for most in college basketball. Young's had a 40-burger twice, meaning if he does it one more time in 2017-18 he'll only trail Wayman Tisdale's career mark of five for the program record. 
Here's how this happens. Notice how Young is dropping long 3s -- and how easy it is. It's so easy because his handle is among the best in college basketball, and although he's not an A-level athlete, he's still quick enough to get by defenders who dare step to him 27 feet from the rim. 
Trae Young just went off for 43pts, 11reb & 7ast 👀 pic.twitter.com/Qqw1sCbSK2
The notion of stopping Young at the college level now seems illegal. You can try to get in his head -- as West Virginia did, when WVU beat Oklahoma last Saturday -- but that alone is not going to toss the Sooners off their course. The Big 12 is the best league in America by a wide margin, and Young is the best player in the country by an even wider one. Through creativity and with an offense that hits like a hammer, Oklahoma's proven itself as a Final Four threat no matter how the rest of the regular season plays out.

We here at CBS Sports have once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award. Every Tuesday throughout the regular season we'll be posting a Freshman of the Week winner in addition to our Frosh Watch, which is a ranking of the top 10 most statistically impressive freshmen in men's Division I college basketball. This weekly feature will work hand in hand with the Tisdale committee and the USBWA. The winner of the award will be announced in March, and a ceremony for all USBWA honors will take place in early April. The cycle for Freshman of the Week consideration runs from every Tuesday through Monday.
We're in Week 2 of the Frosh Watch. There's a new name that has hopped into the rankings. But before we get to that, we have to get to the big man out in the desert who's helping turn around Arizona's season.                           
The 7-foot-1 "power center" (my term) out of the Bahamas is coming into his own. He had a career high of 29 points and 18 rebounds in Arizona's 88-82 home win over Alabama on Saturday. That game was stacked with talent. Rawle Alkins made his Arizona debut, Alabama freshman dynamo Collin Sexton kept his team in it. But Ayton was a force. He showed why he's going to remain in the discussion for the No. 1 pick. He cannot be handle one-on-one. His shooting skill set is such a valuable piece -- and let's not forget that Sean Miller is one season removed from riding another 7-footer, Lauri Markkanen, to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.                          
Ayton's a different player than Markkanen, and much more dangerous all around. On the week Ayton averaged 21 points (on 16-of-27 shooting) and 14 rebounds. Arizona defeated seventh-ranked Texas A&M last Tuesday. That was the deciding factor in favor of Ayton this week. It wasn't just career highs in points and boards, but the fact he was really good in two straight games against teams that should make it into the NCAA Tournament.                           
Heading into the season it was assumed that Allonzo Trier would be the more likely candidate to be an All-American for the Wildcats. Trier still has a good shot at it, but Ayton could wind up as the team's MVP. If both are playing at such a high level going forward, Miller's team will not fall out of the rankings again this season.                          
Here are the top 10 freshman performers in college basketball from the start of the season until now.                                 
Comment: If you have not read it, take the time to learn a lot more about Young right here. I sat down with him for an extended interview out in Portland at the PK80, then did follow-ups with him, his father, coaches and teammates afterward. The bird stuff is too funny -- and too real. Young came close to taking back-to-back FOTW titles. The nation's leading scorer averaged 28.5 points, 8.5 assists and 2.0 steals on 18 for 40 shooting in Oklahoma's wins over UTSA and USC. At this point, 1/3 of the way through the season, Young already feels like a lock to finish top five in scoring average. Freshman seldom achieve that. Next game: Saturday at Wichita State.                  
2. Deandre Ayton, ArizonaKey stats: 20.5 ppg, 11.9 rpg, 1.3 bpg, 67.3 2-pt FG%Last week: No. 3				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: The man looks unfair on a college basketball floor. He's currently No. 4 in KenPom's Player of the Year algorithm. Ayton is top-10 in defensive rebounding percentage, and I'm willing to wager that he's going to have multiple 30-and-20 games this season. He came real close to it vs. Alabama. I lob this question out to you, though, because it's one I've been tossing around my head the past few days. For those who watched Greg Oden at Ohio State, which player would you pick if you had to choose between the two. Oden or Ayton? Next game: Saturday at New Mexico.                 
3. Marvin Bagley III, DukeKey stats: 21.3 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 1.5 apg, 65.7 2-pt FG%Last week: No. 2				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: Bagley couldn't command Duke to a full comeback in Chestnut Hill, as Boston College's upset of the Blue Devils was the 1a. to Arizona State's 1b for top headlines of the weekend. Bagley went for 15 points and 12 rebounds -- plus four turnovers and four fouls in 40 minutes. Against St. Francis (Pa.) last Tuesday, he had 21 points and 11 rebounds in 26 minutes. This is clearly a three-man race for FOY. Bagley is at No. 3 because his PER (31.2, per Basketball Reference) is behind Young (36.5) and Ayton (32.7). Not that controversial to have him slotted here. His production's been superb, but Ayton and Young have been better in full to this point. Next game: Wednesday vs. Evansville.                 
4. Collin Sexton, AlabamaKey stats: 21.8 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 3.3 apg, 47.1 3-pt FG%Last week: No. 4				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: Alabama's dynamic point guard is establishing himself as a probable top-10 pick come June, but he had an interesting week. Bama got a good home W vs. Rhode Island last Wednesday, yet Sexton had 11 points and no assists. Then, at Arizona, he kept the Tide in the game -- scoring 30 points -- but his team came up short, 88-82. A good sign for the Tide: In six of his nine games this season, Sexton has shot at least 50 percent from 3-point range. That threat combined with his lightning speed make him a matchup problem. Next game: Tuesday vs. Mercer.                 
5. Brandon McCoy, UNLVKey stats: 20.2 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 1.9 bpg, 63.4 2-pt FG%Last week: No. 5				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: McCoy is going to be overlooked all season -- except here. If he keeps up his current pace, he's a lock to hover in that 4-6 range here at the Frosh Watch. UNLV is 8-2 and McCoy is playing at a high-major level against some good competition. Last week he went for 22 and 10, with three blocks, in the Runnin' Rebel's win over Illinois. His turnovers (3.4 per game) are undeniably way too high for a big man, however. Next game: Saturday at Pacific.                
6. Tremont Waters, LSUKey stats: 18.3 ppg, 6.6 apg, 3.6 rpg, 2.1 spgLast week: No. 8				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: No one's really quite sure how good LSU is yet, but Waters has been one of the most valuable players in the SEC. Certainly the most valuable freshman to this point. He averaged 14 points, 10 assists and 6.5 rebounds last week vs. UT Martin and UNC Greensboro. Wednesday's home tilt vs. a quality AAC opponent is a nice opportunity for Waters, as he'll go up against Rob Gray and the Houston Cougars. Those back-to-back 10-assist games could be a harbinger of Waters expanding his role, and that would be a boon for LSU. Kid has the goods. Next game: Wednesday vs. Houston.                
7. R.J. Cole, HowardKey stats: 18.9 ppg, 6.4 apg, 2.7 rpg, 1.7 spgLast week: No. 6			 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: His team might wind up as one of the five worst in Division I, but it's not Cole's fault. Howard is now 1-10, the one win coming against Central Pennsylvania. Cole's faced Indiana, Gonzaga, Georgetown -- all on the road. He's earned a spot here. He'll need to keep his numbers at where they are to hang with the rest of the frosh class, though. He has 17 points, eight assists and three rebounds vs. undefeated Georgetown last week. Next game: Thursday vs. Washington Adventist (NAIA)               
8. Kevin Knox, KentuckyKey stats: 15.2 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.9 apg 54.0 2-pt FG%Last week: No. 7				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: Knox slips after only playing once in the past week, with that game being his worst in a UK uniform. In 31 minutes he scored four points on 1-of-9 shooting and had four assists, five rebounds and seven (!) turnovers against Monmouth. Afterward, John Calipari said it was "good for the soul to go 1 for 9." It's a great lesson for him. Kentucky is a quiet 8-1, but it will not be a threat to win the SEC if Knox isn't an all-star type of player. Next game: Saturday vs. Virginia Tech.                
9. Lindell Wigginton, Iowa StateKey stats: 16.2 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.7 apg, 48.9 3-pt FG%Last week: N/R				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: Cyclones fans clamored last week to get Wigginton on the Frosh Watch, and in light of what he did vs. Iowa and Alcorn State (40 points) there's no reason to exclude him. The freshman lead guard was the prize of Steve Prohm's 2017 class. It's a year of turnover for Iowa State, but that's not stopping Wigginton from living up to his four-star hype. He's already on his way to becoming one of the best 3-point shooters in college basketball, and it's clear he's better for ISU when he plays off the ball. Fun player, but ISU's schedule gets much tougher in the next 2-3 weeks, so I'm interested to see if he keeps up his recent pace. Next game: Saturday vs. Northern Iowa.               
10. Hamidou Diallo, KentuckyKey stats:14.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.3 apg, 1.1 spgLast week: No. 9				 				 				 				 				 				 				 				
Comment: Clinging to the 10 spot; Mohamed Bamba and Jaren Jackson are breathing down Diallo's neck here. Yet while Knox had his worst game at Kentucky vs. Monmouth, Diallo looked to have had his best. The uber-athletic shooting guard had 23 points on 62 percent shooting and grabbed four rebounds and a pair of steals. Because Quade Green left the game with an eye injury and Sacha Killeya-Jones did not play, Diallo let his inner alpha take over. The best is obviously yet to come with him. Next game: Saturday vs. Virginia Tech.        
Correction: The original version of this story accidentally noted Shai Gilgeous-Alexander missing the Monmouth game for Kentucky, instead of Sacha Killeya-Jones.

AUBURN, Ala. (AP)  Samir Doughty made a quick 3-pointer to start the second half, Bryce Brown hit two more and Auburn was soaring again.
Jared Harper scored 16 points while Chuma Okeke and Brown each had 14 to help Auburn snap a three-game losing streak with a 92-58 rout of Missouri Wednesday night.
''These last few games we came out the second half lackadaisical, so those 3-balls really got us going,'' Okeke said.
Auburn (14-6, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) used a dominant second half to end the slide that sent the team tumbling out of the Top 25 following a six-week run in the Top 10. This one was actually close for the first 20-plus minutes.
It ended with Auburn's largest margin of victory over an SEC team at Auburn Arena, which opened for the 2010-11 season.
Auburn matched its season-high with 41 3-point attempts and made 16 to help pick apart the league's No. 2 scoring defense, especially after halftime.
''We had 41 3-balls and we missed a bunch of them, but I don't remember but two or three bad shots,'' Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. ''They were good looks, so I was happy with the shots we got. But to beat the best teams on our schedule, we've got to make those shots.''
Okeke had a career-high 12 rebounds and Brown made four 3-pointers.
Missouri (10-9, 1-6) got 15 points from Jeremiah Tilmon and 11 apiece from Jordan Geist and freshman Xavier Pinson, who made his first start. Torrence Watson scored 10.
No. 2 scorer Mark Smith missed the game with an ankle injury.
Auburn's offense snapped out of its funk for a 3-point flurry. Doughty and Brown hit their three 3s in a 1:15 span, to push the lead to double digits for the first time.
''They had two open 3s to start the second half to kind of change the course of the game,'' Missouri coach Cuonzo Martin said. ''They made three of them, and they went from there.''
Okeke scored 11 points in the final 7:32 of the first half to stake Auburn to a 34-31 lead that only grew when the rest of the team heated up, too.
Auburn made seven 3s in the first seven minutes after the half to help turn the game into a rout.
It was the most 3s Auburn had made since hitting 18 in the opener against South Alabama.
BIG PICTURE
Missouri: Has dropped three straight and six of its last seven games. Made just nine of 28 shots in the second half (32 percent).
Auburn: Heated up after a lackluster first half to snap its three-game skid. Had plenty of empty seats after Auburn's fall from No. 7 to unranked.
INJURED STARTERS
Auburn center Austin Wiley (lower right leg) and Missouri's Smith (ankle) both remained out with injuries. Wiley has sat out the past four games. Smith, who has missed two games in a row, leads the SEC in 3-point percentage.
''Kind of game-time (decision),'' Martin said. ''Just felt like he wasn't ready to go.''
PURIFOY'S GAME
Danjel Purifoy had his best game since returning from an NCAA suspension that kept him out last season and the start of this one. He scored eight points and made two 3-pointers.
''I'm almost back to myself, but I'm getting there,'' Purifoy said. Asked if he feels he's done enough to be in the regular rotation he said simply, ''Yes.''
UP NEXT
Missouri hosts Vanderbilt Saturday night.
Auburn hosts in-state rival Alabama Saturday night.

STANFORD, Calif. (AP)  Senior Sedrick Barefield had one final chance to grab a road victory at Stanford. He made the most of it.
Barefield scored 12 of his team-high 18 points in the second half, including four free throws in the final 37 seconds, and Utah beat Stanford 70-66 on Thursday night, its first win at Maples Pavilion as a member of the Pac-12.
''Effort-wise, we really brought it on the defensive end,'' Utah coach Larry Krystowiak said. ''We got enough stops and Sedrick hit the two big 3s. In the second half, it was just enough offense, but it was kind of what we expected . . . a dogfight.''
Barefield connected on a pair of 3-pointers, both times giving Utah the lead, over the final 5:37. His free throws helped nail it down.
''I told Sedrick at halftime to `Button it down, and from a personal point of view, get me a win,''' Krystowiak said. ''He led us offensively, that's for sure.''
Donnie Tillman added 11 points for the Utes (10-8, 4-2), who won their season-high third straight and fourth of six overall.
KZ Okpala scored 22 points to lead the Cardinal (9-10, 2-5), which lost its fifth out of the last seven. Daejon Davis added 17 points.
''We have to look at the little things,'' Davis said. ''We need to clean up a few things. We came in with a plan to stop their 3-point shooting. We didn't do that.''
Utah made 9 of 14 3-pointers. Barefield was 4 of 5. Stanford went 4 of 17 from long range.
''That's a good percentage,'' Stanford coach Jerod Haase said. ''It's pretty impressive. Barefield didn't get a lot of open looks and hit a couple of tough shots. There's a reason why he's considered one of the best guards in the conference.''
Parker Van Dyke, who had 10 points, made a lay-up with 55 seconds left to give Utah the lead for good. Jayce Johnson was a point away from a double-double.
''Our offense was atrocious for the most part; give Stanford a lot of credit,'' Krystowiak said. ''They took Sedrick out, they were real physical with us. We like to run, we weren't able to run; they blocked our shots; they out-rebounded us. I think the key to this game was the defensive end of the floor.''
Stanford opened the second half with a 12-3 run to overtake the Utes at 38-35 and maintained its advantage until Utah scored eight unanswered points to take a lead in the final five minutes and the game swayed back and forth the rest of the way.
Marcus Sheffield hit a 3-pointer to give Stanford a 23-18 lead with 4:50 left in the first half.
Utah, which hit seven of its final nine shots, outscored the Cardinal 13-3 the rest of the way and took a 31-26 advantage into halftime.
BIG PICTURE
Utah had lost six straight in Maples Pavilion and last won at Stanford in 1971. ... Timmy Allen has averaged 8.0 rebounds over his past four games after averaging 3.4 through his first 14 games. ... Barefield has reached double figures in scoring in eight of his last nine games.
Stanford had 10 blocks, seven in the first half, and has 98 total blocks, averaging 5.1 per game, third in the Pac-12 Conference. Oscar Da Silva (24) and Josh Sharma (23) account for about half. ... Davis missed his first six shots and went 1 of 8 in the first half with his only basket on a dunk. He made his first six shots of the second half, including a 3-pointer. ... Freshman guard Cormac Ryan missed his third straight game with an injury. ... Sharma reached double figures in rebounds for the first time in seven games and the second time this season.

CBS Sports is looking back at several of the defining college basketball players of the past and their Citizen Naismith Player of the Year victories. This edition of the series, sponsored by Citizen, stars Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand -- a former Duke icon. 
Well before he was orchestrating NBA-altering moves as the general manager of the 76ers, and just before he was a 17-year vet in the NBA with five different organizations, Elton Brand was the face of the Duke Blue Devils basketball program.
Brand played just two seasons at Duke, 1997-98 and 1998-99, but boy did he ever make them count as his career culminated  with Naismith Player of the Year honors in 1998-1999 as a sophomore. He was an icon in the Duke world, in the basketball world -- and in all of sports. After taking home the Naismith Trophy, Brand left school to become the No. 1 pick of the NBA Draft in 1999; he had nothing more to prove after becoming the best player in college basketball.
At 6-foot-7, 270 pounds, Brand's game was a mix of finesse and power; he was smooth as silk but strong as an ox. So, fittingly, he powered Duke in every way in 1998-99 -- to its best record in program history, an ACC regular season and tournament title, and a postseason run that saw it advance to the NCAA title game, where the Blue Devils were upset by UConn. 
Though Duke fell one win short of cutting down the nets in the last game of the season, Brand and the Blue Devils were dominant. Their 37-2 overall record in his final season still stands as Coach K's best record overall, and it sparked a run of dominance that led to a title two seasons later -- then again nine seasons later ... and five seasons after that.
Brand was a key cog in Coach K's Hall of Fame run at Duke, and with the Naismith Trophy on his resume, he will forever be remembered as an iconic figure in the pantheon of Duke greats.

A former championship-winning Indiana basketball player named Todd Jadlow has written a book about his complicated, drug-affected life, and in it, also makes allegations of physical and emotional abuse against his former coach, Hall of Famer Bob Knight.
Jadlow's book, Jadlow: On The Rebound, includes details such as Knight punching Jadlow in the head, photos of bruises on Jadlow's body allegedly caused by Knight, claims that Knight grabbed and squeezed Jadlow's genitals and recollections of Knight mocking Jadlow's appearance frequently in front of teammates. 
Knight was infamously fired from Indiana in 2000 after repeated breaches of university policy regarding personal behavior. A tape of him choking former player Neil Reid ultimately pushed the legendary coach out of Bloomington. Knight has previously been associated with acts of inappropriate physical or verbal behavior with his own players, opposing players, opposing coaches, his own coaches and multiple Indiana University employees. 
Jadlow played at Indiana from 1985-89. His book is primarily about his long journey from being a major D-I basketball player, to losing control of his life, winding up in prison and battling thoughts of suicide. He says he went so far as to put a gun in his mouth. 
 Bob Kravitz's story at WTHR is bringing Jadlow's book to light and has sparked a lot of reaction over the its following allegations:
Ultimately, he considers himself a big supporter of Knight. 
"I still have a lot of respect for him and look at him as a father  figure. I didn't do this to tarnish him," Jadlow told ESPN.com. "I went through my own  struggles, but these things happened at Indiana. I will let people who  read this book and consider if it's abuse or torment by today's  standards. If things went on today like they did, then you would be in  jail.''
Knight reportedly did not respond to Jadlow's attempts to contact him while writing the book.

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP)  Iowa's Jordan Bohannon feels most comfortable at the end of games, and it showed against Northwestern.
Bohannon hit a 3-pointer from 23 feet with three-tenths of a second remaining as No. 20 Iowa rallied from a 13-point deficit and beat Northwestern 80-79 Sunday night.
It was the second straight game the Bohannon played hero for the Hawkeyes (19-5, 8-5, Big Ten). And again, it was his long-range shooting that did the trick.
''Ice in my veins, right?'' Bohannon said through a laugh. ''No, like I said, I just feel really comfortable toward the end of the games. When you have a coach like Coach (Fran) McCaffery who gives the ultimate green light to you, it gives you the supreme confidence to be able to make shots like that down the stretch.
''Coach McCaffery did a good job of drawing up a good set and I just tried to do what I've always done, just try to close out games and make the most of the time I'm out there.''
Bohannon's second-straight highlight-reel performance came as no surprise to McCaffery, who has gotten to see the youngest Bohannon - who had two older brothers play Big Ten basketball - play since grade school.
''It's one of those things where if it ended the way that it did, you know (Bohannon) is going to make the shot,'' McCaffery said. ''He's been doing it since fifth grade.
''He did it against Penn State, too. He's had an amazing year in that respect. He's fearless. That's why he's got to be on the floor.''
Bohannon scored his first points with 5:28 to go on a jumper and finished with 15 points with 3-for-4 shooting from 3-point range.
Freshman Joe Wieskamp scored 21 points, including a 3-pointer that was part of the Hawkeyes' comeback with less than six minutes remaining. Tyler Cook had 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Isaiah Moss scored 16 points on 6-for-12 shooting.
Vic Law had 24 points and 10 rebounds, Ryan Taylor scored 16 points, A.J. Turner added 15 and Dererk Pardon scored 13 for Northwestern (12-11, 3-9).
The Hawkeyes struggled through most of the game against the visiting Wildcats, getting beat heavily on the boards (37-26) and allowing Northwestern to shoot better than 50 percent from the field.
McCaffery said the final play was drawn up with multiple options, including for Wieskamp, Cook and Moss, in addition to Bohannon. It was up to his son, Connor, to make the right decision.
''We ran a play with multiple options, and it's up to the players to execute,'' McCaffery said. ''It's up to the inbounder to make the right decision.
''You don't want to force it there because it might not be there. We had options for Cook, for Joe and options for (Moss). Connor (McCaffery) had to read it, he made the perfect read and (Bohannon) made the shot.''
Iowa has won three straight and sit three games behind Michigan in the Big Ten Conference standings.
BIG PICTURE
Iowa: The Hawkeyes got a season-defining win 10 days ago against Michigan and backed that up on the road at Indiana. A furious comeback helped erase what would've been a letdown, and now positions the Hawkeyes for several crucial games to better their NCAA Tournament seeding down the stretch.
Northwestern: The Wildcats looked like they were going to snap a three-game losing streak overall and get just their second Big Ten road win this season to go along with their victory Jan. 18 at Rutgers. Instead, they fell further into the trap of playing on the first day of the Big Ten Tournament and have lost four in a row.
POLL IMPLICATIONS
Iowa: The Hawkeyes' comeback all but ensures they stay firmly inside the AP Top 25, especially given the number of ranked teams that lost in the last week.
UP NEXT
Iowa: At Rutgers on Saturday.
Northwestern: Host Rutgers on Tuesday.

BOISE, Idaho (AP)  RJ Williams came off the bench to score 18 points on 7-of-8 shooting and he added four steals as Boise State breezed to a 77-52 victory over Wyoming on Saturday.
Alex Hobbs pitched in with 13 points and five rebounds and Marcus Dickinson scored 12 on four 3-pointers for the Broncos (9-11, 4-3 Mountain West Conference).
Wyoming missed 16 of its 22 first-half shots, including a 0-for-11 effort by Justin James who came in leading the Cowboys (5-15, 1-6) in scoring at 20.5 points per game. Wyoming whiffed on all seven 3-point tries and trailed 28-14 at intermission. The 14 first-half points wasn't a season-low for Wyoming. East Tennessee State held the Cowboys to just one basket and 11 points in a 76-53 victory on Dec. 21.
Hunter Thompson scored 19 to pace Wyoming. The freshman forward hit 6 of 8 shots. The rest of the Cowboys shot 11 of 35 from the floor. James made only 2 of 17 shots for seven points. The senior guard had three of the Cowboys' 24 turnovers.

No. 8 Nevada has won six consecutive games by an average of 20.3 points since suffering its lone loss of the season at New Mexico.
Only one team in that stretch, Boise State, managed to stay within single digits. The teams meet again Saturday afternoon in Reno.
It took a Cody Martin 3-pointer with 4.5 seconds remaining to give Nevada (20-1, 7-1 Mountain West) a 72-71 road victory over the Broncos on Jan. 15.
It figures to be a much tougher challenge for Boise State at Lawlor Events Center, where Nevada, which holds a one-game lead in the Mountain West in its quest for a regular-season three-peat, has won 13 consecutive games and 42 of its past 44.
Boise State (10-11, 5-3), which is tied with UNLV for fourth place in the Mountain West, brings in a two-game winning streak, including a 70-68 victory at Colorado State on Tuesday. That marked the team's first victory in six games decided by one possession.
Despite having an overall losing record, the Broncos sound confident heading into Saturday's rematch.
"We're excited for the direction we're going," junior guard Marcus Dickinson told the Idaho Statesman after scoring 12 points in the win over the Rams. "We're a special team, and I don't think anybody but us really sees that. We're young but we're getting better each game."
Junior guard Alex Hobbs had a team-high 19 points in the first meeting against the Wolf Pack.
"When we're playing at our best, we're one of the best teams in the league," Hobbs said.
Nevada is coming off an 87-70 victory at UNLV on Tuesday night, a contest that wasn't nearly as close as the final score indicated. The Wolf Pack bolted to a 48-26 halftime lead while limiting the Runnin' Rebels to 30.3 percent shooting, including 0-for-12 from 3-point range, before the break.
Nevada led by as many as 25 points early in the second half before coasting to the finish line.
"I thought, defensively, we were phenomenal in the first half," Nevada coach Eric Musselman told reporters. "They're a good offensive team; they can shoot the three. I thought, from a defensive standpoint, we played as good as we're going to play in that first half."
Reigning Mountain West Player of the Year Caleb Martin, who is averaging 18.5 points per game, scored a game-high 26 points to go along with six rebounds in the win. Senior forward Jordan Caroline, son of former NFL star Simeon Rice, added 18 points and 10 rebounds for his 12th double-double of the season. Caroline leads the team in scoring (18.6 points per game) and rebounding (9.7).
"To come on the road and be able to win by double digits, really proud of our defensive effort," Musselman said.
Cody Martin, the 6-foot-7 twin brother of Caleb, leads the Mountain West in assists (5.3 per game) and was the conference's Defensive Player of the Year as a junior. He had 10 points, seven assists and six rebounds in the win over UNLV and hit arguably the team's biggest shot in conference play in the game at Boise State when he snapped a one-month drought from beyond the arc with his game-winner from the top of the key.
"We've got guys who are willing to take big shots, and obviously Cody stepped up," Musselman said.
Nevada has won the past five meetings against the Broncos.

Bowling Green (19-7, 11-2), tied for the East Division lead with Buffalo, has won three straight and faces host Ohio (11-14, 3-10) on Friday. Tipoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET (on CBS Sports Network) from the Convocation Center in Athens. Ohio has lost six in a row and is just 2-8 in its last 10 games. The Falcons are favored by five in the latest Bowling Green vs. Ohio odds, while the over-under for total points scored is 143.5. Before making any Bowling Green vs. Ohio picks of your own, be sure to check out the college basketball predictions from SportsLine's Projection Model. 
This model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has raked in the winnings for those following its picks. Over the past two years, the SportsLine Projection Model has returned over $5,200 to $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks. It also entered Week 16 of the 2018-19 college basketball season on a blistering 16-8 run on top-rated college basketball side picks either against the spread or on the money line. Anyone who has followed it is way up.  
Now the model has dialed in on Bowling Green vs. Ohio. We can tell you it is leaning over, and it has a strong against-the-spread pick that cashes in well over 50 percent of simulations. That one is only available at SportsLine. 
The model knows that Bowling Green has been on a tear since mid-December, winning 15 of 17. Since starting 0-5 on the road, the Falcons have won five of six away from home. They have already clinched their first winning season since going 21-12 in 2014-15. Bowling Green is 7-4 against the Bobcats since 2013-14 and has won three of its past five at Ohio. 
The Falcons are led by junior guard Justin Turner (19 points per game), who has scored at least 20 in each of the past three games, including 34 at Northern Illinois last Saturday. He has equaled or surpassed his average in six of the past 10 games. Junior guard Dylan Frye (12.8 points per game) has come up big recently, surpassing his average in five of his past six games, including 25 in a win over Buffalo on Feb. 1. 
But just because the Falcons are on a roll does not guarantee they will cover the Ohio vs. Bowling Green spread Friday. 
The model also knows the Bobcats can be tough at home, where they have gone 9-4. Ohio has won three of the past five meetings with Bowling Green, including the past two played at home. Ohio is led by junior forward Jason Carter (16.2 points per game), who had 22 in the Jan. 8 loss to the Falcons. He consistently has surpassed his average of late, including five of the past seven games. 
Senior guard Teyvion Kirk (14.6 points per game) has also stepped up his play. He scored 17 in the first meeting with Bowling Green and had 18 points in losses to Eastern Michigan and Miami (Ohio). Sophomore forward Ben Vander Plas (8.9 points per game) had a monster game at Central Michigan, scoring 24 points and grabbing 13 rebounds. 
So who wins Ohio vs. Bowling Green? And which side of the spread can you bank on in well over 50 percent of simulations? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Bowling Green vs. Ohio spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that is up more than $5,200 on its college basketball picks the past two years, and find out.

TCU rejoined the bubble after last night's loss at Oklahoma State. The loss is the third straight for the Horned Frogs.  The last two of those, including the loss at home to Oklahoma on Saturday, are their two worst losses of the season.  The Frogs' second leading scorer, Kouat Noi, missed both of those games and is out indefinitely with an ankle injury.  TCU only has seven scholarship players available with Noi sidelined.
The committee takes injuries and other roster issues into account as part of their process, but it seems to affect seeding more than selection, and even then, not dramatically. Losses are still losses.  The committee does not ignore them or assume a team would have won if not shorthanded.  TCU is going to have to build a resume that gets them selected to the tournament with or without Noi.
Let's take a look at bubble teams in need of wins on Tuesday night.
at Texas A&M, 9 p.m. -- SEC Network 
Alabama has reached a critical point of the season. After two uncompetitive losses to Mississippi State and Florida, the latter at home, the Crimson Tide sit at 15-10. They have two of their next three on the road, all against teams that are not headed to the NCAA Tournament. Alabama already lost to the Aggies at home. The Tide's tournament prospects become perilous if they lose to them again.
vs. Florida State, 9 p.m. -- ESPNU 
Just like football season, I find myself writing a lot about Alabama and Clemson.  The Tigers are still looking for that signature win.  I am not sure a victory over the Seminoles would be that, but it would be Clemson's best win of the season and just its second in Quadrant 1.
 at Penn State, 7 p.m. -- FS1
The Cornhuskers are trying to rebuild their tournament hopes after suffering through a seven-game losing streak.  Nebraska bounced back with wins at home over Minnesota and Northwestern and now look to extend that streak to three against the last-place, but very competitive Nittany Lions.  This one is vital for the Huskers because the next three games are against the league leaders and two are on the road.
 vs. Rhode Island, 8 p.m. -- CBSSN
VCU has won eight of its last nine games to move to the top of the Atlantic 10 standings.  The one loss -- at Rhode Island.  That is VCU's worst loss of the season.  VCU needs this head-butting battle of Rams to go their way.

The bubble focus for Thursday shifts out west, where a couple of fence-sitters in the Pac-12 take the court. There is also a big matchup in the AAC between current leader Houston and preseason favorite UCF.  
It was mostly a productive night for the bubble Wednesday. Most of the teams that needed to win did so, however, we say goodbye to Nebraska for now. 
After falling to Maryland 60-45, Nebraska's implosion is seemingly complete. The Huskers dropped to 12-10 overall after losing for the sixth straight time. Four of those losses, including the one to Maryland, have come at home.
Here's how the other teams bubble teams in action Wednesday fared:
vs. Houston, 7 p.m. -- CBS Sports Network
UCF was the preseason pick to win the AAC, but it is Houston that has shined so far this season. The Knights haven't been awful, but they are squarely on the bubble because their best wins are over fellow bubblers Alabama and Temple at home. They also have a Quadrant 4 loss to FAU on their home floor. This is a chance for a statement win for UCF.
at East Tennessee State, 7 p.m. -- ESPN+
The Terriers lead the Southern Conference, which has three other teams ranked in the top 100 of the NET. ETSU is another of those teams, along with UNC Greensboro and Furman, which won at Villanova earlier this season. Wofford played four potential tournament teams in non-conference play, but couldn't get a win. Winning the league regular-season title is likely the start of any path the Terriers have to an at-large bid.
at Eastern Kentucky, 7:30 p.m. -- ESPN+
Belmont is in the position many teams in non-major conferences face as it tries to keep at-large hopes alive – no margin for error. The Bruins case is pretty sketchy anyway. Their best wins are a sweep of Lipscomb and a win at Murray State. They were swept in their league by Jacksonville State and have a sub-200 loss to Green Bay. The best they can do is win out the regular season and see what happens.
vs. Washington State, 8 p.m. -- Pac-12 Network
Arizona State remains the Pac-12's best at-large candidate, despite being seeded behind Washington in the current bracket. The reason is that the Sun Devils boast three of the Pac-12's five non-conference Quadrant 1 wins. However, they also have a couple of bad losses. They cannot afford to lose to the worst team in the league now.
vs. Washington, 9 p.m. -- ESPN2
Arizona is having a bad week off the court (again) but the Wildcats have a chance to make some waves when Pac 12 leader Washington visits. The Wildcats have a win over Iowa State in non-conference action, but haven't done anything else to back that up. Their current three-game skid started with a weekend to forget in Los Angeles, where the Wildcats lost to UCLA and USC by a combined 44 points. Those are their two worst losses of the season by far. This would be a good time for Arizona to make some amends.

Alabama rolled over again Tuesday, this time at Texas A&M in a 65-56 loss. That makes three straight losses and a season that is fading fast for a team on the NCAA Tournament bubble. Winless, and desperate, Vanderbilt is next. The Crimson Tide needs to start playing like they're desperate.  
Here's how the other teams on the bubble in action Tuesday and a look at bubble teams in action Wednesday.
vs. Villanova, 6:30 p.m. -- FS1
The Hoyas are a longshot to make the tournament, but they have been more competitive than in recent years. That said, they have lost three out of four and cannot afford to lose much more, including Wednesday.
vs. Boston College, 7 p.m. 
NC State already has a lot of wins like the one it can get Wednesday, but the Wolfpack still need it anyway.  When you play a bad schedule, you cannot afford bad losses. NC State is the team benefiting most from the NET because for the most part, it blows out bad teams.
vs. Xavier, 7 p.m. -- CBS Sports Network
Seton Hall has gotten hot at the right time, winning three straight against non-tournament teams in the Big East.  Another visits Wednesday, and another win is necessary.
vs. Louisville, 7 p.m. -- ESPN
Syracuse has wins at Ohio State and shorthanded Duke and that may end up being enough to ultimately get the Orange a tournament bid. They have a great opportunity at high quality wins these next three games starting with Louisville, giving them a chance to erase all doubt.
at LSU, 7 p.m. -- ESPN2
Florida is trying to make a late run into the bracket and there is no better way to spark that run than beating the hottest team in the league in LSU. Florida is just 14-11 and has some quality wins, but they are 3-10 against Quadrant 1 opposition. The Gators will have more chances after Wednesday.
at Florida Gulf Coast, 7 p.m. -- ESPN+
Lipscomb hopes to become the next Dunk City, although probably without the dunks. The Bisons are hoping to play their way into the NCAA Tournament and give themselves a shot even if they do not win the Atlantic Sun Tournament. That means not losing to FGCU.
at Auburn, 8:30 p.m. -- SEC Network
At 14-11, Arkansas desperately needs wins, quality and otherwise, and this is a tough assignment. 
vs. Arkansas, 8:30 p.m. -- SEC Network
Auburn needs this one too because a loss would be its worst of the season. Right now, the best thing you can say about Auburn is that they have only lost to Quadrant 1 teams.
at Marquette, 9 p.m. -- CBS Sports Network
Butler looked lifeless in a loss to the Warriors at home a couple of weeks ago. Things have gotten better since then. The Bulldogs have won three of the four games after that, with the only loss coming at St. John's in overtime. Now, Butler has a chance to give their tournament resume a big boost.
vs. Stanford, 9 p.m. -- ESPN2
If you look at Arizona State's resume, you know this is a game it could lose. The Sun Devils cannot afford that though. They already have three bad losses at home and that is likely to be the limit for them.
vs. Northwestern, 8:30 p.m. -- Big Ten Network
In years with a better bubble, the Buckeyes might be in more trouble than they are.  They have four Quadrant 1 wins on the road, but the only one of those that came against a tournament team was at Cincinnati to start the season.  There's no chance to add to the quality win total Wednesday though. They just need to avoid a bad loss.
vs. New Mexico, 11 p.m. -- ESPNU
Utah State is one of the highest rated teams in the NET not in my bracket and that is due to a lack of quality wins. The Mountain West only has one opponent that can boost a team's resume.  That opponent is not New Mexico, so it's must win for the Aggies.

As the number of games left to play dwindles, the list of bubble teams continues to compress.  Texas has been dropped from consideration after a home loss to TCU on Saturday. Sunday's action centers on the Big Ten, where Indiana and Ohio State are in action to open the day on CBS.
With only a couple conference tournament brackets not yet official and Selection Sunday just one week away, teams are still trying to play themselves into the field of 68. Let's see who is on deck Sunday and how Saturday's bubble teams fared while in action across the country.
Check out Jerry Palm's Bracketology and see his complete projected field of 68 teams.  
vs. No. 21 Wisconsin, 4:30 p.m. ET -- CBS and streaming on fuboTV  
The Buckeyes have been roadkill since the suspension of star Kaleb Wesson took effect before the Purdue game last Saturday.  Suspension or no suspension, the Buckeyes still have to earn selection to the field.  A win over the Badgers would do it.    
vs. Rutgers, 12 p.m. ET -- Big Ten Network and streaming on fuboTV 
Indiana had lost 12 out of 13 and was left for dead in terms of the postseason.  Three straight wins though has the Hoosiers back in play as a potential tournament team.  This is must-win.  Indiana is already 16-14, and the Hoosiers will not be the first 16-loss at-large team in the NCAA Tournament.   
at UNC-Greensboro, 6:30 p.m. ET -- ESPN+
A double bubble game in a smaller conference semifinal is a rarity, but here you go.  Furman has the edge as an at-large candidate because of a win at Villanova.  The Spartans have no bad losses but are lacking in quality wins.    
at Liberty, 4 p.m. ET -- ESPN
The Atlantic Sun title will be decided in this one and Lipscomb is hoping to erase all doubt.  These two teams traded road blowout wins, so Liberty will feel plenty confident going into this.      				
Here's how teams on the bubble fared Saturday:

Draft Strategies for Every Format 

The teams on the bubble seem to have been whittled down after the action Thursday. Only a few won and are still around to try to help themselves.  However, many are looking at résumés that might approach or break some negative marks for at-large teams. More on that can be found below.
First, though, here is a recap of Thursday's games and a look ahead for those remaining in the chase.
This one is easy. The Buckeyes are safely in the field now, if not a great seed, after the 79-75 win over the Hoosiers. They can improve that seed with a win over Michigan State.
Indiana is out after the loss to the Buckeyes, falling to 17-15 on the season. Despite a relatively high number of Quadrant 1 wins, the overall record just isn't good enough to get picked, even in this season of the soft bubble.
NC State hung around for a half, but the top-seeded Cavaliers took over after the break and routed the Wolfpack 76-56 in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals. Now, they wait to see if their relatively gaudy NET ranking is good enough to get them selected.
Florida did what it needed to do to keep its tournament hopes alive by routing Arkansas 66-50. Now, the Gators get a chance to punch their ticket with a win over LSU in the SEC Tournament quarterfinals Friday. They might even get in with a loss. It still has to be a 68-team field.
The Crimson Tide picked up their best win away from home this season in the 62-57 victory over Mississippi. The lack of a big win away from home puts Alabama at a disadvantage when compared to Florida, which already has won at LSU. The Tide can fix that and make plans for the NCAA Tournament with a win over Kentucky on Friday.
The Pirates' strong finish to the season has put them safely into the field, although still in the bottom half of the bracket despite romping past Georgetown 73-57 on Thursday in the Big East Tournament.
The Hoyas, on the other hand, are not so fortunate. Whatever slim at-large hopes the Hoyas fostered got run out of Madison Square Garden in Patrick Ewing's second season as coach.
Creighton saw its five-game winning streak come to an end in a tough 63-61 loss to Xavier and falls to 17-14 on the season. The Bluejays have a top-20 strength of schedule, but only a 3-10 record against Quadrant 1 opponents. I would not rule out hearing Creighton's name on Selection Sunday, but I wouldn't bet on it either.
The Musketeers moved up to 18-14 with the win over Creighton, but do not have a strong enough schedule to be a likely at-large candidate. Xavier might get me to rethink that with a win over Villanova on Friday.
The Sun Devils avoided another bad loss with an 83-72 victory over the Bruins. They will now face surging Oregon in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals. The Ducks are looking like a possible bid-stealer, and if they succeed, it might be Arizona State's bid they steal.
The Huskies struggled, but won 78-75 over USC, and that is what is most important right how. They still have not played well since clinching the Pac-12 regular-season title a few weeks ago. They will face Colorado on Friday in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals hoping to avoid a damaging loss.
You have heard me talk about the soft bubble often this season. Let's take a look at some of the standards that the selection committee may have to lower to put some of these teams in the tournament.
The most obvious one is the historical standard that teams be at least four games above .500.  With the exception of Georgia in 2001, which played the most ridiculous schedule of all time, every at-large team has been at that level or better. The worst record has been 19-15, which Vanderbilt had in 2017 and Alabama had last season.
This year, we could see that broken by Florida or Alabama again, each of which is 18-14 with a tough task ahead of them. Also, Creighton is done playing at 17-14 and Indiana is out at 17-15.
The record for the worst overall strength of schedule is 229 by Charleston in 1994 -- the first year I started tracking data. In 2006, the second year of the weighted RPI formula, George Washington got in with a SOS ranking of 202.
The committee has been much more lenient with non-majors in this category, though. The lowest ranked strength of schedule for a major conference team belongs to Purdue in 2008. The Boilermakers were 108th that year and are the only major conference team to get an at-large bid with an SOS outside the top 100. Thirty-eight non-majors have received at-large bids in 25 years with worse SOS rankings than that Purdue team.
This season, of course, the poster child for lousy scheduling is NC State, which not only has the worst non-conference schedule ever for a potential tournament team, but also has an overall ranking of 121. That seems impossible for a team that played in the ACC.  If not for a NET ranking of 32, which by itself does not mean much, we would not be talking about the Wolfpack as a tournament team.  The committee may take them anyway.
However, even the potential tournament teams among the non-majors have some low strength of schedule numbers. Lipscomb (208), Belmont (198) and Furman (177) would each be in the bottom five of SOS rankings over the last 25 years. Only UNC Greensboro has a relatively inoffensive SOS ranking at 108.
In fact, the best thing you can say about the resume of UNCG is that it is inoffensive. They have no bad losses.  In fact, all six of their losses are in Quadrant 1.  Only one team has ever missed the tournament with all of its losses in Q1. That team was Missouri State in 2006, which is also the team with the best RPI to be left out of the field.
However, the Spartans also do not have a win over anyone in the field of any quality. That could still change, but only one team has ever received an at-large bid without a win over another tournament team. That was Oklahoma in 1998.  The best wins for UNCG are over East Tennessee State and Furman.
UNCG has not given the committee a reason to leave them out of the bracket, but it also has not given the committee a compelling reason to put them in.
Washington also does not yet have a win over another team in my bracket.
Another mark that could fall is the record for most games against Quadrant 4 teams by an at-large team. Currently, that mark is 14, which has happened three times, most recently in 2014 by Temple.  UNC Greensboro has 16 such games, which is the Spartans only real negative. Furman, Belmont and Lipscomb have 17 each.
Arizona State is the leader among bubble teams in bad losses, which is defined as those in Quadrants 3 and 4. The Sun Devils have four such losses, two of them by double digits.  The 16-point loss to Vanderbilt came after Commodores star Darius Garland was injured. The record for bad losses by an at-large team is six by USC in 2011, the first year of the expansion to 68 teams. Wisconsin matched that it is weird season of 2016.

While everyone was watching Duke-North Carolina Wednesday night, the bubble was especially active. Florida picked up a huge win as part of its late season charge toward the bracket, while Arkansas fell apart like Zion Williamson's shoe in a loss to Auburn in a "double-bubble game."  
After losing to Auburn 79-56, Arkansas seems to have packed it in for the season. At 14-12, 3-10 against the top two quadrants, there just isn't much to talk about for now. Auburn, on the other hand, picked up another blowout win at home. The Tigers need to do something away from home eventually.
Florida picked up its best win of the season, and third road win against Quadrant 1 opponents, in a 82-77 overtime victory at LSU. The Gators still have work to do. They are currently 15-11 with three pretty winnable games coming up before the rematch with the Tigers in Gainesville. Florida needs to pad that win column.
Here's how the rest of the bubble teams in action Wednesday fared:
vs. Michigan, 7 p.m. -- ESPN 
The Gophers broke a four-game losing streak with a blowout win over Indiana last Saturday. Now, they get a shot at what would be their biggest win of the season. Michigan is one of the three co-leaders of the Big Ten, so it's a big game for the Wolverines too.
at Cincinnati, 7 p.m. -- ESPN2
The Knights are still looking for that first Quadrant 1 win and this is a chance to get it. UCF can also pull into a tie for second place in the AAC with a win over the Bearcats.
vs. Eastern Illinois, 8 p.m. -- ESPN+
Belmont's tournament resume took a hit Wednesday when Lipscomb lost at Florida Gulf Coast. The Bruins beat their Nashville rivals twice in the regular season and those are two of their three best wins. Thursday's game is one that could end any talk of Belmont as an at-large team if it loses.

Wednesday was not a great night for many bubble teams, although NC State picked up a decent win.    
Auburn and Lipscomb are among a handful of bubble teams that lost a chance to help themselves.
Seton Hall defeated Georgetown 90-75 in a game featuring two teams on the bubble and has done a better job of defending its home floor lately. This is the third straight win at home for the Pirates.  Things are about to get tougher because three of their next four are on the road. Georgetown's slim chances just got a lot slimmer.
Here's how the rest of bubble teams in action Wednesday fared:
vs. VMI, 7 p.m. -- ESPN+
Wofford will look to not just avoid a bad loss to the last place Keydets, but dominate the way a NCAA Tournament team should.
at Tennessee State, 8 p.m. -- ESPN+
The Bruins are the same boat as Wofford in that this is a team that they have to dominate.  The Tigers are .500 in the OVC, but are outside the top 300 of the NET.  It's a road game, but Belmont needs to impress.

Just about every team on the bubble is in action on Saturday as we are now four weeks from Selection Sunday. There is still time for most teams to make a move, but that clock is ticking.      
A few teams have chances to make big statements, but one thing this very soft bubble has shown us so far is that not many teams have shown the ability to do that.
There is one double-bubble game on Saturday involving two teams fighting for their lives.
UNC-Greensboro travels to face Wofford in a battle between Southern Conference teams who are each 22-4 and in the top 50 of the NET. The Terriers won the first meeting by 29 points and and are the better at-large candidate because of a better non-conference schedule.
at Vanderbilt, 12 p.m. -- ESPNU			
Auburn needs quality wins, but Vanderbilt is having a rough season, so this is one of those games where the Tigers just have to take care of business and wait for the next opportunity.   				
at Louisville, 12 p.m. -- ESPN 				
The Tigers could be catching Louisville at a good time if the Cardinals are still hanging their heads about blowing that 23-point lead against Duke in a loss on Wednesday night. Like NC State, Clemson is looking for a big win away from home to impress the committee. 				
at TCU, 12 p.m. -- ESPN2				
Oklahoma needs to beat somebody. Anybody. The Sooners have lost five straight to drop to 15-10 overall, but have played an unusually strong schedule. That is about the only thing keeping their hopes alive at the moment. 				
vs. Oklahoma State, 1 p.m. -- CBS, CBSSports.com and streaming on fuboTV 
Texas has done enough damage to itself on its home court this season with losses to VCU, Providence and Radford. The Longhorns have three of their next four on the road.  They really need to take care of the home court. 				
vs. Indiana, 2 p.m. -- ESPN2 				
The Gophers' loss at Nebraska has put them on the bubble, but on the better side of it.  Minnesota is only 3-7 against Quadrant 1 opponents and has losses to Boston College and Illinois. Indiana in in position to make a late push, but needs to find the form that helped the Hoosiers get off to a 12-2 start. 
vs. Florida, 2 p.m. -- ESPNU 				
Alabama has been playing hit and miss basketball for about six weeks. The time has come for the Tide to start stringing together hits, especially in games against teams that are not currently in contention. 				
This is not quite a double-bubble game, but if Florida can get hot, it still has time to make a run at an at-large bid. 				
at Air Force, 4 p.m. 
Utah State needs a big win, but this is not a game against Nevada.  Their somewhat gaudy NET ranking is a little deceiving because of a lack of quality wins. 				
at Dayton, 4 p.m. -- NBC Sports Network				
The Rams hope to stay tied with Davidson atop the Atlantic 10 standings, but have to win in a tough place to do so.  The Flyers are just one of three A-10 teams in the top 100 of the current NET ratings. 				
at Duke, 6 p.m. -- ESPN				
NC State is one of the teams that not only most needs to make that big statement, but has the chance to make the biggest of all – win at overall No. 1 seed Duke.  The Wolfpack is still trying to make up for a putrid non-conference schedule and the fact that their few wins of any significance have come at home.  There is only one more game on their regular-season schedule that will help them. 				
at Kennesaw State, 4:30 p.m. -- ESPN+				
Lipscomb lost at home on Wednesday to Liberty, the only team in the Atlantic Sun it could afford to lose to.  A loss to No. 332-ranked KSU would end any a-large hopes. 				
at USF, 6 p.m. -- ESPNU 				
Temple's last road game was a disaster – an 18-point loss at Tulsa.  The Owls cannot afford many more outings like that, even against teams like USF. 				
vs. Memphis, 6 p.m. -- ESPN2 				
The Knights have wins over fellow bubblers Alabama and Temple at home, but they should not count on that being enough.  UCF's resume is being helped by the fact that their loss at home to FAU earlier in the season has recently moved up to Quadrant 3 from Quadrant 4.  The Knights beat USF at home Wednesday night and Memphis is an opponent of similar quality. 				
at Tennessee Tech, 8:30 p.m. -- ESPN+				
Belmont is still in the hunt for an at-large bid until it loses to someone not named Murray State.  At last report, Tennessee Tech has not changed its name. 				
vs. DePaul, 8 p.m.  -- FS1 and streaming on fuboTV 
Butler is largely a home court hero.  That means that defending the home court against teams like DePaul, which is improved but still not a potential at-large team, is vital to their tournament hopes. 				
vs. Mississippi State, 8:30 p.m.  	-- SEC Network			
Arkansas had a rough week, losing two road games to teams that are not tournament contenders.  A win over the Bulldogs would be just the Razorbacks second Quadrant 1 win. 				
at Utah, 10 p.m. -- FS1 and streaming on fuboTV 
The Sun Devils continue to play to the level of their competition. They beat league leader Washington at home, but sandwiched that game with a blowout loss at home to Washington State and a loss at Colorado last time out. Arizona State needs to start bringing the same effort to games like this that it does to games like Washington. 
at Oregon State, 10:30 p.m. -- Pac-12 Network and streaming on fuboTV 
Oregon was thought to be done with the injury to Bol Bol, but the Ducks do own one of the Pac-12's five non-conference, Quadrant 1 wins.  That came over Syracuse.  Oregon has won four of its last five and needs to stay hot to have a chance at an at-large bid.

It was a mixed day on the bubble as you would expect with so many games on Saturday. Teams like Oklahoma and Minnesota picked up big wins, while Clemson missed a great chance against Louisville.
In the SEC, all the talk was about the Tennessee-Kentucky game, but a couple of bubble teams really hurt themselves with a tough losses. Let's take a look back at Saturday's action.
at Michigan State, 1 p.m. -- CBS 
Ohio State's resume isn't the most stellar, but in this field, it is good enough to be a 10-seed, give or take.  A win in East Lansing would add a gold star to that resume.
at Creighton, 3 p.m. -- FS1 
This is the second game in eight days between these two teams.  The first was won by the Pirates, and they may need to win this one too when you consider the rest of their schedule.  They still have to play at St. John's and at home against Villanova and Marquette.

Weekend Developments 

We have roughly 150 games going on this Saturday, so there is a lot of action involving teams all over the bracket and those trying to get in. It's a big day for several bubble teams, but it is hard to call anything must win with five weeks still to play. Some of these teams can make life much easier for themselves though.
There are three "Double Bubble" games featuring teams on the bubble going against each other. 
Butler at Georgetown, 12 p.m.: Both of these teams are on the fringes of the bubble and would be more damaged by a loss than helped by a win. Butler has a split of Florida this season and win over St. John's at home, but has been awful on the road. The Hoyas have been more inconsistent, showing the ability to win a tough game, but also losing a couple they shouldn't.
VCU at St. Bonaventure, 2 p.m.: VCU is a game back of Davidson in the Atlantic 10 standings, but the better NCAA Tournament at-large candidate because of wins over Temple and Texas in non-conference play. The Bonnies are struggling this season, so a loss for VCU would be damaging.
Arkansas at South Carolina, 3:30 p.m.: The Razorbacks are hanging around the cutline mostly due to wins at LSU and at home over Indiana before the Hoosiers tanked. South Carolina is better than its 10-11 record would indicate and especially at home, but the Hogs need to keep its hot streak going. 
vs. Virginia Tech, 12 p.m.
This is a great opportunity for Clemson to pick up a quality win. Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams has been trying to keep things afloat while Justin Robinson and PJ Horne sit out with injuries. Even shorthanded, the Hokies were good enough to hold NC State to 24 points on the road. A win Saturday would be Clemson's best of the season so far.
at Tulsa, 12 p.m.
Temple is on a quest to send out retiring coach Fran Dunphy with an NCAA Tournament berth. A win over Houston has helped that cause, but these are the kind of games Temple needs to win. Most of the games left on the Owls schedule can only hurt their tournament hopes.
at LSU, 2 p.m.
Despite a NET ranking of 20, Auburn is on the high side of the bubble largely due to a lack of quality wins and poor play on the road. The Tigers only Quadrant 1 win is against Pac-12 leader Washington, at home, of course. Their only other win against a team in the bracket came against Alabama last week. A win Saturday means we are done talking about Auburn as a bubble team for a while.
at Iowa State, 2 p.m.
TCU has played five conference road games and lost them all. The Frogs are still looking for their first Quadrant 1 win. Victories at home over Texas and Baylor and a lack of bad losses are what is keeping TCU near the bottom of the bracket for now, but they need something eye-catching. A win over Iowa State on the road would be huge for TCU.
at Pitt, 2 p.m.
NC State has shown in the last week that it can lose badly whether it scores 24 points or 96. Maybe a trip to Pittsburgh, which has lost six in a row, can start pointing the Wolfpack in the right direction again. They are at the point where a loss here could put them on the wrong side of the fence.
vs. Boston College, 2 p.m.
The Orange have a couple of big road wins that have kept them in the tournament hunt and allowed them to overcome home losses to Old Dominion and Georgia Tech. It's that kind of inconsistent play that has Syracuse in the bottom half of the bracket. This is the kind of game NCAA Tournament teams win, and the Orange needs to avoid another bad loss.
at Tennessee, 4 p.m.
The Gators have played a tough schedule, but have not been up to the challenge so far. They need both quality and quantity wins to get back into tournament contention. None would be bigger than going on the road and taking down No. 1.
vs. Texas Tech, 4 p.m.
Oklahoma has unique profile in that it has not played a game against a Quadrant 4 opponent. That has inflated their schedule rating somewhat, but the Sooners have still played a pretty good schedule. They lack quality wins though, with victories at home over Wofford and TCU ranking as the best. Saturday gives them a great chance to improve that.
vs. Jacksonville, 5 p.m.
Lipscomb needs to keep winning and winning big if it hopes to sneak into the field as an at-large team. They will be heavy favorites against Jacksonville and need to play like it.
vs. Western Carolina, 7 p.m.
The Terriers are facing what we used to call an RPI killer in NET No. 286 Western Carolina. Fortunately for Wofford, it can mitigate the strength of schedule damage in the NET by running up  a big score.
vs. Creighton, 8 p.m. 
Seton Hall is living off of early season wins over Kentucky and Maryland, but not for much longer if the Pirates don't stop this skid they are riding. They have lost six out of eight, including both games to DePaul. This is the start of an easier part of the schedule for Seton Hall and the Pirates need to take advantage of it.
at West Virginia, 8 p.m.
Which Texas will we see Saturday -- the one capable of beating North Carolina and Kansas or the one capable of losing to Providence and Radford?  The Longhorns play to the level of their competition like no other team. Saturday brings a trip to last place West Virginia. Good Texas needs to start showing up more often.
at Vanderbilt, 8:30 p.m.
Alabama has not been a very good road team, although if the Crimson Tide misses the tournament, home losses to Texas A&amp;M and Georgia State will be a big reason why. Bama plays three of the next four on the road, but two of those are to non-contenders. This is how they can begin to make up for those bad losses.
at Purdue, 8:30 p.m.
It appears that Nebraska has nothing left in the tank for a tournament push. Isaac Copeland's injury has not only taken a key contributor out of the lineup, it has made a thin team even more so. However, the Huskers are in the Big Ten, which means quality opposition almost every time they take the floor and a chance to turn things around. Mackey Arena, where Purdue is undefeated, seems like an unlikely spot to break a six game losing streak, but that is the task at hand.
vs. Washington, 10 p.m.
Arizona State is coming off of one of the worst losses any team in the bracket has – a 91-70 pounding by Washington State in Tempe on Thursday night. The Sun Devils have also lost at home this season to Princeton and Utah, but beat Kansas. Go figure. Because the league is so bad, this is the last chance for ASU to pick up a win of any quality this season, and now they need it.

Almost every team on the bubble that hasn't already lost in its conference tournament is in action Thursday. Big games are everywhere.   
In an important "double-bubble" game Wednesday Clemson lost to NC State 59-58 in the first round of the ACC Tournament. After blowing a 16-point halftime lead there is not much hope left for the Tigers to make the tournament now. The Wolfpack still has work to do and the opportunity to do it. They will get a shot at Virginia next. 
TCU, the other bubble team in action Wednesday beat Oklahoma State 73-70 in the frst round of the Big 12 Tournament 73-70. The Horned Frogs also blew a big lead late, but was able to salvage a victory in the end. With no more chances for damaging losses, TCU should be safely in the field now. 
Status before Thursday's game: First four out
Thursday's result: Lost to Ohio State 79-75 in Big Ten second round
Status before Thursday's game: No. 11 seed
Thursday's result: Defeated Indiana 79-75 in Big Ten second round

Status before Thursday's game: No. 10 seed as projected Pac-12 Tournament champion
Thursday's result: Defeated USC 78-75 in Pac-12 quarterfinals
vs. Mississippi, 7 p.m. in SEC Tournament second round -- SEC Network 
The Crimson Tide comes in somewhere between Florida and Alabama in the world of 17-14 teams. They have a couple of nice wins at home over Kentucky and Mississippi State, but have been pretty bad against the better teams they have played otherwise. They have a draw that can help, if they can somehow win a couple of games. 				
vs. UCLA, 9 p.m. in Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals -- Pac-12 Network and streaming on fuboTV 
The Sun Devils are the one power conference team suffering at the hands of the NET. The have done reasonably well against the top two quadrants, but have four bad losses, more than any other team under consideration.  A loss to the Bruins would be a fifth. 				
vs. Georgetown, 9:30 p.m. in Big East Tournament quarterfinals -- FS1 and streaming on fuboTV 
The Pirates finished strong, with home wins over the top two teams in the Big East, Villanova and Marquette. It would not be a good idea to give some of that back here. 				
vs. Seton Hall, 9:30 p.m. in Big East Tournament quarterfinals -- FS1 and streaming on fuboTV 
Georgetown still has an outside shot to get in, but more likely needs to win the conference tournament.

A new bracket is up and I believe I had the least movement in a February bracket in all the time I have been doing this, at least among the top 16.  The only change was Tennessee and Virginia swapping places on the top line, with the Cavaliers moving to No. 2 overall and the Vols dropping to third overall. 
That's it.  The rest of the top 16 is the same from Friday.   
Kentucky got a big win over Tennessee over the weekend, but I do not believe it is enough just yet to supplant Gonzaga for a No. 1 seed.  The thing that is different about Kentucky's profile vs the No. 1 seeds is losses to Alabama and Seton Hall.  Only Duke has a loss as bad as either of those and the Blue Devils were down two starters when they lost to Syracuse.  I believe it is possible for Gonzaga to get jumped without losing, with Kentucky and Michigan being the most likely teams to be able to do that.

With a month to go, I thought it would be a good time to see how the NET is treating some teams differently than the RPI, and what impact it might make on the selection process. The most important thing to note is one thing that is the same as it was with the RPI – the NET is not a decisive metric. No metric is. Even if all metrics agree on something, the committee may not.  The metrics largely do not measure what the committee is trying to reward, which is playing strong schedules and doing well against them. Ken Pomeroy himself told the committee it should not use his ranking for that reason. They list it on the team sheet anyway. Click here for more on how the NET is determined and used.
The NET's main function is to be the ranking that is used to define the four quadrants, which is how the committee groups a team's opponents by quality. For example, the Quadrant 1 opponents are those a team has played at home that are ranked in the top 30 of the NET, neutral court opponents in the top 50 and road opponents in the top 75. See the Bracketology page for the other quadrants. 
No potential tournament team is benefiting more from the NET than NC State. The Wolfpack just cracked the top 100 in the RPI for the first time this season after losing to Duke on Saturday. They rank 96th in that metric, but because they are the top team in net efficiency, which is a form of uncapped margin of victory, they rank 32nd in the NET. 
NC State's schedule is dreadful and quality wins are lacking. In the RPI era, that No. 96 ranking wouldn't get them much of a look.  The NET gave them a chance to get credit for running up the score on their cupcake schedule and they did just that. The Wolfpack played eight opponents currently ranked 275 or below in the NET, six of those south of 300, and won by an average of almost 36 points per game. That is a big reason why they are so much higher in the NET.  However, NET or no NET, the committee isn't going to care about that margin of victory. Since strength of schedule is still RPI-based, and the Wolfpack has the second worst non-conference schedule in all of Division I, they are going to have to overcome that. An awful non-conference SOS gets a team left out almost every year. 
For opponents of NC State though, that 36 ranking is pretty nice. It makes the Wolfpack a Quadrant 1 opponent in neutral court games and if they played the Wolfpack on the road. A home game against NC State rates as Quadrant 2. Each of those is one quadrant better than if the RPI was in place. 
And that's where NET differences from the RPI have the most impact. The NET ranking of a team's opponents is more important than its own. For a team like Auburn, which lost to NC State, that loss does not look as bad as it would have in the RPI. 
Other teams that are one quadrant better no matter where you played them are Nebraska and Penn State, each from the Big Ten. The Cornhuskers are 39th in the NET, up from 92nd in the RPI. Penn State is up to 39 places in the NET, from 109 in the RPI to 70th. 
Note that those are major conference teams. The seven teams that are one quadrant lower no matter where the game is played are all non-majors. Those teams are Drake, UC Irvine, Utah Valley, Charleston, Georgia State, Georgia Southern and Princeton. Drake is actually two quadrants lower if a team played the Bulldogs at their place. 
Of the 74 teams that are one quadrant worse as an opponent in at least one of the game location categories, only four are from major conferences. Those are Washington, Minnesota, Seton Hall and Wake Forest.   
This should come as no surprise. While the NET may boost the rankings of some of the better teams from the non-majors, the vast majority were going to be worse off. That means the quality of some of the opponents of those teams are going to rate lower. 
We will not know until March how things may have been impacted for this season. Even then, we will not be able to draw any long-term conclusions because one year is not a trend. Also, there are rumblings that the new secret formula may be revisited in the offseason.

Weekend Developments 

All of the hype surrounding Wednesday's North Carolina-Duke game blew up just 36 seconds into it when Blue Devils freshman forward  Zion Williamson tore through his shoe, slipped and injured his knee.
Williamson did not return, Duke did not recover, and the Tar Heels went on to an 88-72 victory.
It is Duke's third loss of the season, and the second at home in which a starter went down with an injury early in the game. The Blue Devils lost guard Tre Jones early in their loss to Syracuse on Jan. 14
After the game, it was reported that Williamson's injury is believed to be a mild knee sprain. Further testing will be done to confirm that and determine the severity of the injury.
The NCAA Tournament selection committee takes things like injuries and other roster issues into account, but they affect seeding, not selection. Obviously, selection is not a problem for Duke, but TCU, for example, is currently playing without its second leading scorer and sliding down the bracket. The Frogs need to put together a resume that will get them selected regardless.
When it comes to seeding, the selection committee gives just a little more weight to how a team has played with the roster it will be taking into the tournament than otherwise. That does not mean the losses without an injured player are ignored or treated as wins. Losses are losses. Injuries just provide some context. Even if seeding is impacted, it is not dramatic – no more than one line either way. The Blue Devils are a No.1 seed in the latest Bracketology and did not fall off the top line even after losing to the Tar Heels.
Duke is still good enough to win most of their games without Williamson, especially with time to prepare to play without him. It remains to be seen how many games he misses, but a slump while he is out could end up affecting Duke's seed.

Tennessee's 82-80 overtime loss at LSU and Kentucky's 80-53 domination of Auburn, we give us our first change in the No. 1 seeds in the bracket since Feb. 3.  
The Volunteers will drop down to a No. 2 seed and be replaced on the top line by the Wildcats. Kentucky will be the fourth overall No. 1 seed, behind Duke, Virginia and Gonzaga.    
At 23-4, Kentucky has one more loss than the 24-3 Volunteers, but makes up for that with a high number of quality wins and a head-to-head win over Tennessee. Head-to-head record is not as important in college basketball as it is in seeding for the College Football Playoff, but it is also not nothing.  
Virginia defeated Louisville 64-52 earlier Saturday and Duke defeated Syracuse 75-65. Gonzaga was also in action vs. BYU late Saturday night.
The other seed swaps among the top four involved Texas Tech and LSU moving up to the 3-seed line after big wins, while Purdue and Kansas dropped to a four.  The Red Raiders hammered the Jayhawks on Saturday night in Lubbock and Purdue did nothing wrong to move down.  The Boilermakers won at Nebraska. and LSU and Texas Tech just have better resumes now as a result of those big wins.  The bracket is not a poll, where you hold your spot if you win.  It always depends on what other teams do.
At the bottom of the bracket, we welcome Alabama back in after a win over Vanderbilt and say goodbye to Furman, for now, after the Paladins lost at home to Wofford.  That part of the bracket figures to churn heavily over the next three weeks.
When it comes time for the committee to bracket the teams, geography is the driving force.  As much as possible, they want to give teams the chance to play close to home.  However, sometimes other bracket principles get in the way of that.
Nevada is a 5-seed, and as it turns out, two of the four pods that 5-seeds can play in are in San Jose.  That would be perfect, but Nevada ended up in Hartford anyway because all of the other 5-seeds are currently Big Ten teams.  Purdue is a 4-seed in Hartford, so in an effort to keep the other Big Ten teams out of that pod, Nevada ends up getting sent there.  The bracketing rules technically allow either Iowa or Wisconsin to be in the same pod as Purdue because each of them have the Boilermakers on the schedule only once in the regular season; however, a second meeting with either team in the conference tournament would preclude that.  I try to keep teams from the same conference out of the same pod unless it is unavoidable and the committee will do that too.
Another principle that sometimes gets in the way is protecting teams seeded 1-4 from a potential home crowd disadvantage in the first round.  The 15-seeds work out not too badly geographically, which isn't always the case.  Radford can play in the South and South Dakota State gets a relatively short trip to Des Moines, Iowa.  Geographically, Wright State, from Dayton, fits nicely in Columbus, but that is too close and violates the home crowd principle.  Therefore, it gets shipped to Jacksonville to play Tennessee and Loyola goes to Columbus to play Michigan.

A new bracket projection is posted this morning and it was a rough week for the teams that were previously No. 2 seeds.   
Things started going badly on Monday night when Virginia came back and won at North Carolina. Tuesday night saw Kentucky lose at home to LSU on a last second tip-in. At the same time, Michigan melted down and lost at Penn State, which had previously been 1-11 in the league. Despite that, Michigan's loss is still considered a Quadrant 1 game. That shows how strong the Big Ten has been this season.   
Michigan State bucked the trend by winning at Wisconsin on Tuesday night.   
No. 9 overall Purdue could have possibly moved up to a No. 2 seed, but the Boilermakers also lost on Tuesday night, shooting 20-71 from the floor in a loss at Maryland.   
The result of all of that is very little. The No. 2 seeds shuffled around a bit, but all of them stayed on that line. LSU, coming off that big win at Kentucky, jumped up to a No. 3 seed, knocking Purdue down to a No. 4.   
It's reasonable to assume with all the games left among those teams at the top of the bracket, we will see more shuffling in the next month.

[Check out Palm's full bracket with all 68 seeds and the first four four teams out on our Bracketology page] 
The bottom of the bracket is where things get difficult to sort out. This is one of the weakest collection of teams I've ever seen on the bubble.   
It is so bad that I cannot get Oklahoma, which is 15-10 and losers of seven of its last nine games out of the bracket. Texas, at 14-11, would be just second team to get an at-large bid with a record of fewer than four games above .500. The other was Georgia in 2000, which played such an insane schedule that no team can be compared to it.   
Arizona State has a few good wins, but keeps taking bad losses. Still, there they are.    
UCF has only beaten Alabama and Temple at home and lost to Florida Atlantic at home. The Knights are still in too.   
Clemson and Arkansas are one-hit wonders. The Tigers, which lost this week at Miami, and the Razorbacks, who have a couple of bad losses, are the last two teams in the bracket.   
And if we wanted to kick them out, which teams do you replace them with?  Georgetown?  The Hoyas have a nice win or two, but a very soft schedule and a couple of bad losses. Butler? Its best win is vs. Mississippi at home, of course, because the Bulldogs struggle to win anywhere else.    
Utah State? The Aggies have a nice NET rating, but not much to back it up. Their best win is St. Mary's.   
UNC Greensboro or Furman? The Southern Conference, led by Wofford, has a few decent teams in it, but only Furman has an eye-catching win. The Paladins beat defending champion Villanova on the road. Their overall schedule is very soft though. Same for UNCG, which does not have a bad loss, but also doesn't have a significant win.   
This bracket needs a few teams to make a late run to play their way in to the field. Or perhaps, a few conference tournament upsets to steal some of those bottom of the bracket bids.   
There is still a month to go though, so anything can happen.

A new bracket projection is now posted and the top two lines remain unchanged from Friday. Duke and Tennessee each got pushed on the road on Saturday, but survived. The Blue Devils did so in dramatic fashion.  
The game that ended up having the biggest impact on the top of the bracket was North Carolina's 83-62 loss at home to Louisville. The Tar Heels dropped two seed lines as a result and are now behind Louisville on the S-Curve. The Cards profile is a bit of a mixed bag. That win is huge, along with an overtime win over Michigan State, but they also lost at Pitt. Still, Louisville looks like a team with some upside as we go forward.  
At the bottom of the bracket, Purdue and Iowa broke up the logjam of Big Ten teams in the First Four of Friday's bracket. The Boilermakers picked up a big road win at Wisconsin on Friday night, while Iowa knocked off Ohio State on Saturday. Both teams were able to move up to the middle of the bracket based on those wins and the results of other teams.  
That is something to keep in mind if you are tracking the movement of your favorite team. Such movement is rarely only about your team. Rankings, including the 1-68 used to fill in the bracket, are relative. Your team can pick up a big win and not move up appreciably if the teams ahead of you did well also. In fact, your team can win and drop if someone behind them did even better. Also, each team's entire resume gets reevaluated with every bracket. A win that looked big earlier may not look so big now. Conversely, what was once thought to be a bad loss may not look as bad.

No team is benefitting more from the new NET rankings that NC State. The Wolfpack ranks 113rd in the RPI because of a putrid non-conference schedule that features nine Quadrant 4 home games. However, NC State is 16th in the NET because it is one of the best teams at running up the score. The Wolfpack is No. 5 in Net Efficiency, which is essentially a measure of uncapped margin of victory.  
Liberty and Murray State are the other two teams that are outside of the top 100 of the RPI, but in the top 50 of the NET. Florida, which is not in the bracket, but not terribly far off, is 96th in the RPI and 40th in the NET.  
Teams from all walks of life in college basketball are represented among the teams benefitting most from the change from the RPI to the NET, but the teams that are most negatively affected are all from outside the power conferences. The 60 teams with the biggest negative difference in ranking from the RPI to the NET are all from non-power conferences.   
St. John's took a head-scratching loss to DePaul at home on Saturday, but was without the services of its best player, Shamorie Ponds. The committee will note that Ponds did not play, and that is given some consideration when it comes to seeding, but keep in mind that the committee will not ignore the loss or assume the Red Storm would have won if Ponds had played. A loss is a loss.  
The committee does put a little more weight on what a team does with the roster it is bringing to the tournament than otherwise – good, bad or otherwise – but the consideration given for injuries and other roster issues is rarely dramatic.  
And, yes, the committee knows all about your team's injuries, suspensions, travel problems, and whatnot. The schools report all of that to the committee. I may not know about every one of those situations (though I do try), but the committee does.

It's getting to be crunch time in the college basketball season. We are inside of a month away from Selection Sunday and time is running out for teams to make their cases for inclusion in the NCAA Tournament. Many conferences are down to five regular season games, but some of the smaller conferences that play their tournaments two weeks before Selection Sunday are down to three games.

A new bracket is up as we count down to the end of the regular season. Only three days remain and the only tournament yet to begin is the Ivy League's. The major conferences' top seeds will be in action, if they have not been already.  
In the ACC, the semifinal we have all been waiting for will finally happen. Duke will finally get to play North Carolina with Zion Williamson in the lineup. Williamson made his triumphant return Thursday, setting a record for conference tournament play by going 13-13 from the floor in an 84-72 win over Syracuse. As good as Williamson was, it still took a while to put Syracuse away, even though the Orange was without its leading scorer, Tyus Battle.
With the Tar Heels currently a No. 1 seed and the Blue Devils a No. 2 seed, the Duke-UNC game is likely for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. With Virginia already a lock for the overall No. 1, a Duke win would give the league two No. 1 seeds and it is possible that the league could end up with three No. 1s if Duke beats the Tar Heels. North Carolina would need some help though, especially from the SEC. I believe the Tar Heels would not be seeded ahead of the SEC champion if it is Kentucky or Tennessee. However, there is a chance they would be seeded ahead of LSU, if it wins the SEC Tournament. It is a harder sell for Duke as a No. 1 seed if they lose to UNC for a third time, and this time with Williamson back in the lineup.

Draft Strategies for Every Format 

Mid-American Conference heavyweights Buffalo and host Toledo meet Friday evening. Buffalo (21-3, 9-2), which started the season 11-0, is ranked 25th in The Associated Press poll, and has been since the second week of voting. The Bulls have been ranked as high as No. 14. Toledo (20-4, 8-3) has won five straight, but dropped an earlier meeting at Buffalo. The Bulls and Rockets meet at Savage Arena with tip-off set for 7 p.m. ET. Buffalo is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Buffalo vs. Toledo odds, while the over-under for total points scored is 160.5. You'll want to see what the SportsLine Projection Model is saying about the game before laying any Buffalo vs. Toledo picks down of your own.
This model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has raked in the winnings for those following its picks. Over the past two years, the SportsLine Projection Model has returned over $5,200 to $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks. It also entered Week 15 of the 2018-19 college basketball season on a blistering 99-67 run on top-rated college basketball picks against the spread. Anyone who has followed it is way up.
Now the model has dialed in on the Buffalo vs. Toledo spread and crunched the numbers. We can tell you it is leaning under, and it also has a strong against-the-spread pick that cashes in well over 60 percent of simulations, indicating the line is way off on this one. That one is only available at SportsLine.
Buffalo is out to win its third straight game and is 10-2 in its last 12. The Bulls have dominated Toledo of late, winning the past three meetings and 10 of the last 14. Buffalo also has some favorable trends in that it is 13-9-1 against-the-spread in all games and is 8-5-1 ATS as the road favorite. The Bulls also are 11-8-1 ATS as the favorite, while Toledo is 3-4 ATS against teams that win 65 percent or more of their games.
Buffalo has three players who average 10 or more points, led by senior guard CJ Massinburg (18.5 ppg), senior guard Jeremy Harris (13.9) and senior forward Nick Perkins (13.3).
But just because Buffalo has been red-hot all season long does not guarantee a cover Friday against Toledo.
The Rockets have been hot, winning five straight and eight of 10. Toledo is 11-1 at home. Some trends also favor Toledo, which is 15-8 against the spread in all games. The Rockets are 7-4 ATS at home and are 4-1 ATS when the spread is +1 to +4.5.
Jaelan Sanford (15.8 ppg) is Toledo's leading scorer. He has equaled or surpassed his average in six of his past nine home games, including 29 points in a December win over Cornell. Senior forward Nate Navigato (12.6 ppg) has also played well of late, surpassing his average in three of the past four games, including 20 at Miami of Ohio Jan. 29.
So who wins Buffalo vs. Toledo? And which side of the spread can you bank on in well over 60 percent of simulations? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Buffalo vs. Toledo spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that is up more than $5,200 on its college basketball picks the past two years, and find out.

CHICAGO -- The way John Calipari explains it, all of the big questions coming from Kentucky fans in recent weeks -- questions about his team, questions about his approach -- would not exist if the Wildcats had just not squandered that game against Seton Hall at Madison Square Garden two weekends ago.
"We had the ball up 3 with 1:30 to go in New York and somehow gave that game away," Calipari said. "If we'd won that game, we wouldn't have all this craziness. But this is Kentucky. Good luck."
Good luck, indeed.
Which is precisely why Saturday's 80-72 win over No. 9 North Carolina in the second game of the CBS Sports Classic here at United Center was such a massive development for the 19th-ranked Wildcats. Simply put, it ended the craziness -- at least temporarily. And it's impossible to overstate how important it is to end the craziness at Kentucky even if it's always only temporary.
"We have the greatest fans in the country ... but they also want to win every game by 25," Calipari said. "And if you lose a game, you've got the outliers that try to create issues. None of us listen to them. But, you know."
Yes, Cal, I definitely know.
Everybody with a Twitter account knows.
And that's why the best way to properly understand how big of a win this was for Kentucky is to first understand what a loss would've done. So here's what a loss would've done: A loss would've dropped a team that was No. 1 in the CBS Sports Preseason Top 25 And 1 to 0-3 against top-90 KenPom opponents and 0-3 away from Rupp Arena -- with a game at Louisville on deck. Lose this one, and then that one, and the Wildcats would've entered January with zero quality wins and zero wins away from home. And, fairly or unfairly, because it really doesn't matter when it comes to Big Blue Nation, the questions surrounding Calipari, this team, his recruiting approach and anything else you can think of would've been loud and intense.
No, Calipari would not have been in some sort of hot-seat situation; don't be silly or get it twisted. But nobody likes to be criticized or questioned, and the criticism directed at Calipari, and the questions about Calipari, would've reached an all-time high with Kentucky fans if he'd lost this game and then backed it with a loss at Louisville.
Now that scenario is off the table.
So now everybody at UK can breathe a little and actually enjoy Christmas -- which is something Roy Williams suggested will be difficult for him to do. "I hope everybody has a better Christmas than I'm going to have," North Carolina's Hall of Fame coach said to the assembled media.
He was mostly joking, I think.
But, if not, blame Kentucky's Ashton Hagans because the 6-foot-3 guard was a difference-maker on the defensive end -- where he had seven steals and three blocks. His biggest sequence came after North Carolina cut Kentucky's lead to 66-60 with 6:47 remaining. UK's subsequent possession resulted in a missed jumper. But then Hagans got a steal that led to a PJ Washington 3-pointer with 6:10 left. Then, just 12 seconds later, Hagans got another steal and turned it into a layup -- meaning the score went from 66-60 to 71-60 in a 29-second span thanks to two North Carolina turnovers Hagans created.
"His defensive-presence is amazing," said UK freshman Keldon Johnson, who finished with a game-high 23 points. "He was locking up, making plays, big stops -- and you could just see it rubbing off on everybody."
It's impossible to know for sure what comes next for the Wildcats. They could lose at Louisville, then flourish in the SEC. They could beat Louisville, then struggle in the SEC. They could be consistently awesome going forward or up-and-down in a way that drives UK fans crazy. As always, time will tell.
But, if nothing else, this win over UNC buys time.
The craziness Calipari noted has subsided.
Probably not forever.
But at least until next weekend. And, trust me, that's not worth nothing.
