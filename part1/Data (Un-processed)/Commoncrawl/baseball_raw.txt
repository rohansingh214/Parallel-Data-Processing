SAN FRANCISCO -- It was just one flight of the baseball. Just one swoosh of Ichiro Suzuki's magic bat. Just one laser beam streaking off toward the place where batted balls live on forever.
But when everything else fades from one more All-Star Game victory for the American League -- in what is beginning to feel like a never-ending series of American League victories -- this was the moment that all the Wite-Out in California won't be able to erase.
This was the tale of the amazing Ichiro, gliding around the bases on a journey into All-Star history.
This was the tale of a suddenly defenseless outfielder by the name of Junior Griffey, watching a baseball that was determined to pinball around the funkiest right field in America until the man who hit it had orbited the bases.
This was the tale of the first inside-the-park home run ever hit in an All-Star Game -- a round-tripper that would become the defining moment Tuesday night in a 5-4 game that was won by the team that always wins the All-Star Game.
Think of all the sprint champs who have played in this game. How could Rickey Henderson never have hit an inside-the-parker in an All-Star Game? Or Maury Wills? Or Lou Brock?
Think of all the ballparks this game has been played in. Think of all the baseballs that have clattered off the walls in the most misshaped outfields in history. In Fenway. And Wrigley. And the Polo Grounds.
How could it be possible that none of those parks had ever manufactured the one classically goofy bounce it takes to produce a moment like the one we witnessed Tuesday night at AT&T Park?
We have no idea how events can conspire like that to keep something like this from happening for more than 70 years -- and then, in one fluky collision of events, it happens right before your eyes.
But we're grateful now, because the sight of this man legging out this inside-the-parker was one we'll never forget.
"You know, in batting practice tonight, I saw some balls take some weird hops off that fence out there," said Ichiro's fellow AL center fielder, Torii Hunter. "And I said to myself, 'If anyone ever hits one off one of those corners out there, somebody's going to get an inside-the-parker.' Well, here came Ichiro."
Yeah, here came Ichiro, all right. He wriggled into place in the batter's box in the fifth inning Tuesday night. He already had two hits on this night -- one fewer than he'd gotten in all his other All-Star at-bats (all 15 of them) combined.
But this hit -- the third hit -- would be the one that would keep on traveling for the rest of his career.
He smoked a Chris Young fastball deep into the ionized night, way way way back in distant right-center field. In a lot of parks on either side of the Pacific, it was a ball that would have come down in somebody's popcorn cup. But not this one.
Instead, it splattered off one of the All-Star Game banners stretched out across the wall in the deepest part of the yard -- a banner sneakily hiding one of the trickiest angles in the entire ballpark.
So Griffey went motoring off in the direction he thought it would carom -- only to have the baseball fake left, and go right, and hop on off into No Man's Land. OK, make that Inside The Park Land.
Imagine what was going through the heads of these two men -- two of the most gifted and charismatic players who have ever played baseball -- in that moment.
We bet you'll correctly guess exactly what one of them was thinking, anyway.
Asked what went through his mind, Griffey had to laugh.
"Well," he answered, "it's a four-letter word."
He laughed one more time.
"And there was an 'Oh' in front of it."


-- NL second baseman Chase Utley

Meanwhile, the man in the midst of circumnavigating those bases had a slightly different reaction.
"I thought it was going to go over the fence," Ichiro would say afterward. "And when it didn't, I was really bummed."
Then again, at the time, what did he know about the unique thrill of legging out an inside-the-park homer? All those games (1,042 of them on this side of the Pacific, 951 on the other side). All those hits (1,482 of them in North America, 1,278 more in Japan). And none of them -- not one -- had included an inside-the-park home run. How could that be?
But the sight of him legging out this inside-the-parker was one that filled many of his fellow All-Stars with awe.
"One thing I noticed," said Josh Beckett, the man who would become the winning pitcher, thanks to this homer, "is, he wasn't as tired after he scored as most people are when they hit a triple."
"I think it took him like maybe 5.2 seconds (to make it around the bases)," Hunter said. "All I know is, I looked up, I saw the ball roll and he was at home plate already."
All right, not quite. By our stopwatch, it took him 15 seconds to round those bases. Then again, once Griffey had finished scrambling after the ball and making a frantic throw that cleared the heads of two potential cutoff men, there wasn't much need for the guy to hurry. He eased in standing up.
"It didn't matter," said one of those potential cutoff men, NL second baseman Chase Utley. "He flies, man. Even a perfect throw wouldn't have gotten him."
Of course, we'll never know if that's really true or not. But it sounds good, now that we've seen how this turned out.
And because that was how it turned out, this game was never the same. A 1-0 National League lead had just turned into a 2-1 American League lead. That soon became a 3-1 American League lead, thanks to a home run by Carl Crawford -- a guy whose team (the Devil Rays) had registered one previous All-Star hit in franchise history.
And by the ninth inning, that lead was 5-2, with two outs and nobody on. Seattle's unhittable J.J. Putz (he of the 0.88 ERA) was on the mound, about to close it out. The National League hadn't won one of these All-Star Games since the Clinton administration (1996, if you'd lost track). And this game looked just about as over as the Ice Age.
Whoops. Ya never know. Dmitri Young chopped a two-out infield single off Brian Roberts' glove. Then Alfonso Soriano -- a guy who was 0-for-9 lifetime off Putz -- inside-outed an opposite-field home run. And all of a sudden, it was 5-4.
Then, in the historic First All-Star Battle of the J.J.'s, Putz walked J.J. Hardy. And you could feel something stirring.
Not once, in this whole season had Putz allowed three straight hitters to reach base via a hit and/or walk. But he'd just done it in this game, with two outs in the ninth.
So the next thing you knew, the next closer in line, Francisco Rodriguez, was marching in and issuing two more walks. And it was hard to believe, but the bases were loaded and the potential winning run was on second base.

-- Ichiro

Rodriguez swore he wasn't worried -- just trying to make hitters hit his pitch, not their pitch -- with two outs, he said. But that didn't mean his teammates weren't getting antsy.
"That was scary, man," Hunter laughed. "That put fear in my heart. I'm telling you."
But two pitches later, K-Rod pulled the plug on all that fear, getting Aaron Rowand to fly out to deep right field. And it was safe for Ichiro to march back out onto the field and collect his MVP award, after the second three-hit game by an AL leadoff hitter in All-Star history (joining Rickey Henderson in 1982).
"It's one (game) that I'll never forget," Ichiro said, carrying on valiantly even though he'd been forced by MVP duties to cancel his postgame restaurant reservation. "The past six years, I never had an All-Star Game that I really thought I gave it my all or was able to give it my all. So I'm really happy. It was a fun All-Star Game."
But not only was it fun. It might have been the most spectacular All-Star Tuesday anybody had ever had in the history of All-Star Tuesdays. The heck with Carl Hubbell. The heck with Ted Williams' game-winning homer.
Because Ichiro did more on this day than merely wipe out that lifelong inside-the-park schneid and add another trophy for his memorabilia room. He also all but settled a five-year contract extension with the Mariners worth close to $100 million.
Now that's a big day.
"That's a really good day for him," said Hunter, a prospective free agent this winter, and one who didn't seem too despondent that the potential center-field free-agent pool had just shrunk by one. "Give me that deal, and I'd be happy, too."
Hey, we bet. But will he celebrate with an inside-the-park homer? That's the question.
"If that's what it takes, then I'm going to run," Hunter laughed. "Even if I get a single, I'm going to try for an inside-the-parker."

NEW YORK -- As the innings wore on Tuesday night, American League manager Terry Francona was surveying his options, and none was pretty. If the All-Star Game had lasted much longer than 15 innings, J.D. Drew might have had the unique opportunity to make two appearances in the game's box score.
"Another couple of innings, and he would have pitched," Francona said.
Pitched? As in, gone to the mound?
"As [the situation] started to come to fruition," Drew said, "I was a little bit nervous."
For good reason, since Francona was serious: Drew would have been asked to take the mound for the American League. Luckily for Francona, Drew and the entire Red Sox organization, it never came to that. His hitting and defense were enough to garner Drew the Most Valuable Player award in his first All-Star game, which ended with a 4-3 win for the AL.
When Scott Kazmir was summoned to pitch the 15th inning, Francona had exhausted his entire staff of 12 pitchers, and he started to go over his options. Drew was one who came to the forefront.
Did he really think it could happen?
"You never know what Terry will do," said Drew, with his crystal MVP trophy by his side. "If he had told me to do it, I would have done it. Just throw some stuff up there. I got some sneaky stuff here and there. I don't know if I would have got anybody out."
What he did get out, as in out of the park, was a 2-1 pitch from Reds pitcher Edinson Volquez -- a two-run shot in the seventh inning to tie the game. It was the first real sign of life for the AL, and Drew, who was booed routinely at Yankee Stadium all night, got his first loud applause.
"It was brief, to say the least," Drew said with a smile. "It was a little weird  as the game went along, I think they forgot I hit a home run and [the taunting] picked up again."
He played the last 10 innings and finished his night 2-for-4, with a walk, a stolen base and the two-run homer. He became the fourth Red Sox player to win the All-Star MVP award (named in Ted Williams' honor). And consider the class Drew is in: The other three Boston MVPs were Carl Yastrzemski (1970), Roger Clemens (1986) and Pedro Martinez (1999).
Drew's night was a far cry from when he first arrived in Boston before the 2007 season, with a $70 million, five-year contract. The expectations were high, and when Drew struggled last year, Boston fans showered him with boos, similar to what he heard most of the night Tuesday in New York.
Drew said, though, that his strong end to last season, when he hit .314 during the postseason, catapulted him into this one, in which he leads the Red Sox with a .984 OPS.
"I've always had confidence and ability," said Drew, who became the 15th player to hit a home run in his first All-Star at-bat. "It's been a nice little run; we've still got a long ways to go. But this is definitely a good night."
A good night for him, and his manager. Otherwise, who knows what would have happened if Drew had been called upon to throw his first major league pitch in the All-Star Game? After all, he hasn't thrown a pitch competitively since high school nearly 15 years ago.
"I would have been ready," Drew said. "I've given [Francona] a hard time in the couple years I've played for him. If he ever runs out [of pitchers], just give me a holler."
No need on Tuesday night. All Drew needed to be was himself.

NEW YORK -- Albert Pujols will be in a familiar spot when St. Louis hosts the 80th All-Star Game. Boston knuckleballer Tim Wakefield is headed for a brand new situation.
Pujols was the leading vote-getter in balloting for the Midsummer Classic announced Sunday by Major League Baseball, giving the Cardinals first baseman the start in his home ballpark.
"It feels great to be there and represent the organization and the city you play in," Pujols said.
The NL MVP is well on his way to another amazing year, leading the majors with 31 homers and 82 RBIs. He collected 5,397,374 votes to finish with the second-highest total in major league history, trailing only Ken Griffey Jr.'s six million votes in 1994.
"I think that's just a recognition around the country that he's had a phenomenal first half on top of a phenomenal career," St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. "I'm sure our fans supported him, but he's been incredible and it's well-deserved."
Pujols has made the NL team eight times in nine seasons and will be making his sixth start.
Wakefield made his first All-Star roster in his 17th season, one of a major league-high six Red Sox headed to Busch Stadium for the July 14 game. The 42-year-old right-hander is tied for the big league lead with 10 wins.
Wakefield got a standing ovation when Boston's All-Stars were announced at Fenway Park, and acknowledged the cheering crowd with a wave.
"I have a lot of emotions running through right now," he said after Boston's 8-4 victory over Seattle. "It's a pretty proud moment for me and my family."
Teammate Dustin Pedroia, the reigning AL MVP, passed Texas' Ian Kinsler in a close vote at second base and left fielder Jason Bay also won a spot in the lineup.
While Pedroia rallied to get the start, Red Sox first baseman Kevin Youkilis was caught by Yankees slugger Mark Teixeira in the final voting.
Youkilis made the team, anyway, along with Boston ace Josh Beckett and closer Jonathan Papelbon.
The injury-riddled Mets lead the NL with four selections. Center fielder Carlos Beltran and third baseman David Wright were both elected by the fans, but Beltran has been out with a bruised right knee and likely won't play.
New York ace Johan Santana and closer Francisco Rodriguez were selected by the players.
Starting for the NL: Pujols at first, Philadelphia second baseman Chase Utley, Florida shortstop Hanley Ramirez, Wright at third, Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina and Beltran, Milwaukee's Ryan Braun and Philadelphia's Raul Ibanez in the outfield.
Molina, who turns 27 on July 13 and is the youngest of three brothers playing catcher in the majors, becomes the first of his siblings to make the All-Star Game.
"It's special for me, for my family, for the people of Puerto Rico," he said. "It's a small country, and it's special for them, too."
The AL starting lineup: Teixeira at first, Pedroia at second, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, Tampa Bay third baseman Evan Longoria, outfielders Bay, Josh Hamilton of Texas and Ichiro Suzuki of Seattle, and Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer.
Hamilton held onto his starting spot despite being on the disabled list for much of the first half with an abdominal injury.
"I don't feel I personally deserve to go but at the same time the fans voted me in so I'm more than happy about that," he said. "It's a real honor for me to go for a second time around."
Jeter was the leading vote-getter in the AL and will make his 10th appearance and sixth start in the Midsummer Classic.
Jeter and the AL beat the National League 4-3 in 15 innings at Yankee Stadium last season to improve to 11-0-1 since the NL last won in 1996 at Philadelphia's old Veterans Stadium, the longest unbeaten streak in the game's history.
Once again, the league that wins the All-Star Game will get home-field advantage in the World Series.
As usual, there were a few snubs to go along with a couple of missing players used to playing in baseball's showcase game.
Houston first baseman Lance Berkman, Milwaukee right-hander Yovani Gallardo and Washington slugger Adam Dunn were left off the NL squad. Detroit first baseman Miguel Cabrera, Texas righty Kevin Millwood and Angels starter Jered Weaver failed to make it in the AL.
Dodgers outfielder Manny Ramirez and Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, both 12-time All-Stars, weren't expected to make the rosters, but their absence was compelling nonetheless.
Ramirez was suspended for the first 50 games of the season for violating MLB's drug policy and A-Rod missed time following hip surgery after admitting in spring training to using steroids when he played for the Rangers.
There is still one spot to be determined on each 33-man roster, which was increased by one from last year.
The AL candidates for the last spot in Internet voting: Kinsler, Toronto designated hitter Adam Lind, third basemen Chone Figgins of the Angels and Brandon Inge of Detroit, and Rays first baseman Carlos Pena.
The NL candidates: Arizona third baseman Mark Reynolds, outfielders Matt Kemp of the Dodgers and Shane Victorino of the Phillies, Giants infielder Pablo Sandoval and Nationals shortstop Cristian Guzman.

NEW YORK -- Philadelphia Phillies center fielder Shane Victorino and Detroit Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge have been elected by fans to Tuesday's All-Star game in record-shattering voting exclusively on MLB.com, the official Web site of Major League Baseball, and the individual club sites.
Victorino received 15.6 million votes and was followed by San Francisco's Pablo Sandoval, Arizona's Mark Reynolds, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Matt Kemp and Washington's Cristian Guzman.
Inge got 11.8 million ballots, finishing ahead of Texas' Ian Kinsler, the Los Angeles Angels' Chone Figgins, Tampa Bays' Carlos Pena and Toronto's Adam Lind.
"To all the fans across the country, mahalo for your support," said Victorino, a native of Hawaii. "I am so honored and appreciative of the passion that everyone has shown to make this dream come true, especially with the number of votes cast. It's just unbelievable."
The Phillies went all-out to get Victorino selected to his first All-Star game. He went door-to-door in South Philadelphia with Mayor Michael A. Nutter to campaign for votes on Monday. Three fans in their early 20s won a radio station promotion and sat in the press box lounge for 52 straight hours clicking nonstop on their computers for their favorite player. Fans in the ballpark and people listening to the game on radio or watching on television were constantly reminded to "Vote for Shane."
Even Victorino's teammates joined in the campaign while playfully poking fun at the player known as the "Flyin' Hawaiian." After Victorino delivered the game-winning hit in the ninth inning Wednesday night, Chan Ho Park walked out of the bullpen wearing a two-sided billboard that read: "Vote Victorino."

ST. LOUIS --  President Barack Obama was true to his word: He didn't bounce it.
Determined his ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game would reach the plate on the fly Tuesday night, Obama delivered -- barely. St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols helped him, moving up to scoop the low toss inches off the dirt.
"We did a little practicing in the Rose Garden," Obama said during a half-inning with the Fox broadcasters. "This is as much fun as I've had in quite some time."
Television viewers, however, were initially left to wonder whether the presidential pitch skipped. The TV angle cut off Pujols' catch, and many people at Busch Stadium weren't completely sure.
When Obama later visited the broadcast booth, Fox showed a replay from the center-field camera that proved the ball made it home in the air.
"I did not play organized baseball when I was a kid and so, you know, I think some of these natural moves aren't so natural to me," Obama said.
Obama was at ease visiting the teams before the game and during his time on the air. Asked whether there were bailout funds to help the National League's losing streak, he cracked, "We're out of money."
Wearing a Chicago White Sox jacket, jeans and sneakers, and cheered by the sellout crowd, Obama walked out of the NL's dugout on the first-base side, shook hands with Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan Musial and trotted to the mound.
Fresh from warming up a day earlier on the White House grounds, Obama went right to rubber, all 60 feet and 6 inches away. The left-hander wound up and bit his lip as he let fly.
Obama grimaced slightly, but gave a fist pump when Pujols -- a Gold Glove first baseman -- made the neat grab with a specially made black mitt with "Obama #44" and an American flag on it.
Obama became the latest Chicago hoopster to try his hand at baseball. Like Michael Jordan, the president looked more comfortable in his other job.
"I scooted up a little bit, but I think I was going to catch it in the air the whole way," Pujols said. "I was more nervous not to drop the ball, believe me. I wasn't worried about him bouncing the ball."
The All-Star Game capped off a big sports outing for the president. He began the day by greeting Wimbledon champion Serena Williams at the White House, then picked up Hall of Famer Willie Mays in Michigan for the flight to St. Louis.
Mays, who started playing baseball when segregation was still widespread, told Obama that he was filled with pride when the nation elected its first black president in November.
"I reminded him that I cried for most of the night in
Chicago," said Mays, still emotional as he spoke about that night
eight months ago.
"So that tells me all the things I went through, it was for
good things," said Mays, who wore an orange-trimmed, black Giants
baseball cap with his suit. "So I'm just proud of him, you know.
He may be proud of something else. But I'm proud of him, what he
stands for."
As for what advice regarding the pitch he gave Obama, the Say Hey Kid said: "Follow through."
"He'll be fine. I guarantee it," Mays said aboard Air Force One.
This was the second time Obama threw out a first ball at a big league game. As a U.S. senator, he did it when his favorite White Sox played the Angels in the 2005 AL Championship Series.
"When you're a senator, they show you no respect so they just hand you the ball. You don't get a chance to warm up," Obama said. "Here, at least they had me down with Pujols in the batting cage, practicing a little bit."
Obama's motorcade left the ballpark in the bottom of the fourth inning, and the AL eventually won 4-3 for its seventh straight victory. He was due back at the White House shortly after midnight ET.
After arriving in St. Louis, Mays and Obama walked off the plane arm-in-arm, and headed to the ballpark.
Obama first visited the NL's clubhouse. Known for trash talking on the basketball court, he saved a little bit for the locker room.
After greeting Pujols, the most fearsome hitter in the majors, Obama went over to Milwaukee star Prince Fielder, who won Monday night's Home Run Derby.
Pointing at Fielder, the president said, "Hey Albert, what happened, this guy, man -- in your home park? What's going on, man?"
Obama left that side with a souvenir, too. Phillies outfielder Shane Victorino, like Obama from Hawaii, gave the president some macadamia nuts.
Next stop was the AL clubhouse, where he gibed Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter for being so old and signed an autograph for Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki. A White Sox fan, Obama was glad to see pitcher Mark Buehrle, the only representative from the president's favorite team.
Buehrle said he didn't really believe it when Obama said he would wear a White Sox jacket to the mound.
"I looked up and I was like, 'Holy Cow, he's actually doing it.' Everybody around me was giving me a hard time saying, 'What the heck, he's wearing White Sox stuff.' That's how we roll in Chicago, we got the president behind us," Buehrle said.
Added the president: "Everybody knows I'm a White Sox fan and my wife thinks I look cute in this jacket. Between those two things, why not?"
Obama and former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter joined together for a seven-minute video about community service shown on the scoreboard at Busch Stadium and Fox.
Baseball commissioner Bud Selig had invited Obama to the game.
"It's a big thing. The players will enjoy it. The fans will enjoy it. But it's another testament to the meaning of this sport," Selig said earlier Tuesday.
"We are a social institution and whether we want to admit it or not, and for years I don't think baseball wanted to admit that, we do have enormous social responsibility, and clearly that intrigued the White House and the president."

PHOENIX -- Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Roy Halladay will start for the
National League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game against the Los Angeles Angels' Jered Weaver.
The NL batting order has Milwaukee's Rickie Weeks leading off
and playing second base, followed by designated hitter Carlos Beltran of the Mets, Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp, Milwaukee
first baseman Prince Fielder, Atlanta catcher Brian McCann, St.
Louis right fielder Lance Berkman, Cardinals left fielder Matt Holliday, Colorado shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and Cincinnati third
baseman Scott Rolen.
The AL has Yankees center fielder Curtis Granderson leading off,
followed by Cleveland shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera, Boston first
baseman Adrian Gonzalez, Toronto right fielder Jose Bautista, Texas
left fielder Josh Hamilton, Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre,
Boston designated hitter David Ortiz, Yankees second baseman
Robinson Cano and Detroit catcher Alex Avila.
Halladay, 11-3 with a 2.45 ERA, started the 2009 All-Star Game
while with the Toronto Blue Jays and will be the fourth pitcher to
make an All-Star start for both leagues, following Vida Blue, Roger
Clemens and Randy Johnson. Halladay is the first Philadelphia
pitcher to start since Curt Schilling in 1999.
"It never seems easy, doesn't seem like it's pitching dominated," Halladay said. "It's always a challenge."
Weaver, 11-4 with a 1.86 ERA, is the fifth Angels pitcher to start, following Ken McBride (1963), Dean Chance (1964), Nolan Ryan (1979) and Mark Langston (1993).
"Having a chance to pitch ... against the best players in the world in the National League and be able to share the mound with a guy like Roy Halladay and all of the other pitchers, it's a very humbling experience," Weaver said. "I'm definitely looking forward to having my family out here to be able to experience it with me and I'm just looking forward to the experience."

Add the Milwaukee Brewers to the teams disappointed in Tony La Russa's All-Star performance.
La Russa, who will become the second retiree to manage an All-Star team in the game's 79-year history next week, turned Cincinnati manager Dusty Baker into a conspiracy theorist Sunday when three Reds were selected but Johnny Cueto and Brandon Phillips were not among them.
"The comments Dusty made clearly disappoint me and are attacking my integrity," said La Russa, who was allowed to manage the NL squad despite retiring after winning the World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals. "The All-Star experience is too important to let anything stand in the way of a decision like that."
But now there are folks in the Brewers' camp who are disappointed right-hander Zack Greinke wasn't chosen and surprised that La Russa said the Milwaukee ace wasn't considered because of his pitching schedule.
The 2009 Cy Young Award winner with the Kansas City Royals is in fact lined up to pitch Saturday, a decision made to actually improve his chances for pitching in the All-Star Game, Brewers sources told ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney on Monday.
The Brewers' staff went to Greinke recently, the sources said, and presented him with some options, including a schedule that would allow him to be in position to pitch next Tuesday in the Midsummer Classic in Kansas City -- where Greinke began his career.
The Brewers, who rallied to beat Miami on Monday despite a subpar outing from Greinke, have only one player going to Kansas City in reserve outfielder Ryan Braun.
Greinke allowed five runs in six innings Monday but did not factor in the decision and still owns a 9-2 record with a 3.08 ERA. He spoke about his All-Star ommission with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, acknowledging that he had hoped to make the team but that he does not feel snubbed.
"I thought, depending on how many relievers made it, I might," Greinke told the Journal Sentinel. "There are so many good starters this year. There's half a dozen that have done just as good as the guys that made it. I can't really complain. The starters this year, it's got to be the best in the last 20 years, maybe 30 years. It's pretty amazing. You can't please everyone."
Greinke also decided not to criticize La Russa.
"I wanted to make the team. It's not an easy job picking them," he told the paper. "There's other guys that have pitched great, too. You can't make everybody happy. No matter who (La Russa) picks, there's going to be arguments. It's kind of like the BCS stuff. No matter what you do, it's going to be bad."
Baker's Reds will be sending three players. But it's two players who weren't selected -- Cueto, a right-hander, and second baseman Phillips -- that had the manager floating a theory
stemming from a 2010 brawl with La Russa's Cardinals.
"A snub like that looks bad," Baker told reporters. "Johnny and Brandon were at the center of a skirmish between us and the Cardinals. Some of the Cardinals who aren't there anymore are making some of the selections."
Reds first baseman Joey Votto was selected by the fans to start, while reliever Aroldis Chapman was voted in by the players and outfielder Jay Bruce was a coaches' selection.
But Baker, in saying he was pleased by the trio's inclusion, on Sunday pointed to the 2010 incident.
"I'm happy for the guys who made it big time, especially for Chapman," Baker said. "You figured that Joey would make it. We knew Jay had an outside chance. You also figured that Johnny Cueto and Brandon Phillips had a great chance. I don't understand that one."
Cueto leads the Reds with a 9-4 record and a 2.26 ERA, which ranks fourth in the NL. Phillips is batting .285 with 10 homers and 46 RBIs.
This will be La Russa's sixth time managing an All-Star team, three in each league. He agreed to work for commissioner Bud Selig after stepping away.
"If Dusty had been more interested in Cueto being on the team, then he wouldn't be pitching him on Sunday," La Russa said. "Cueto probably would be on the team if he wasn't pitching Sunday."
For his part, Greinke told the Brewers he wanted a chance to pitch in the All-Star Game, and the Milwaukee pitching schedule was arranged so that he would start Monday night and then on Saturday before the All-Star break, rather than on Sunday.
The Brewers did not receive a call from La Russa or others asking about Greinke's pitching schedule, a source told Olney. La Russa told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he had been informed that Greinke was scheduled to pitch Sunday before the All-Star break, and that was why he wasn't considered for the NL team.
La Russa spent 16 seasons with St. Louis and managed for 33 seasons overall. He is third on the career list with 2,728 wins, trailing second-place John McGraw by just 35 victories.
"It's kind of difficult to be overly happy today, considering the two guys I thought were shoo-ins aren't going to be on the team," Votto said Sunday of Cueto and Phillips. "That's frustrating. I knew I was going to be an All-Star. I was hoping those two guys, the five of us, would go to Kansas City. As much as I don't want to get into a (debate) right now, as happy as I am for myself and Jay, I'm disappointed for the two guys who are very, very meaningful to this first-place ballclub."
Cueto was suspended for seven games in 2010 for his actions during the brawl, and both Baker and La Russa were suspended two games. The three were also fined undisclosed amounts, while four other players were fined but not suspended.
The first-inning fight happened during a critical series made even more tense by comments from Phillips, who said that he hates the Cardinals. He also called them complainers, using demeaning language that riled St. Louis.
Phillips came to the plate in the bottom of the first inning and gave a friendly tap to Cardinals cather Yadier Molina's shin guard. Molina kicked at the bat, mentioned Phillips' comments and told him not to touch him. The two went face to face, prompting both benches and bullpens to empty.
The scrum escalated into shoving that ended up with several players including Cueto pinned to the backstop screen. Cueto began kicking those around him -- he later said he was afraid and trying to defend himself. La Russa said at the time that backup catcher Jason LaRue suffered a mild concussion and had sore ribs from the incident.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  Prince Fielder made a splash at the All-Star Home Run Derby. Eight of them.
The Detroit slugger joined Ken Griffey Jr. as the only players to win multiple titles, thrilling the crowd at Kauffman Stadium with several shots into the right-field fountain and beating Toronto's Jose Bautista 12-7 in the final Monday night.
"Just being mentioned with him is real special," said Fielder, who spent time at Griffey's house when he was a kid. "My dad would let me go over and play video games all day. He always took care of me when I was a kid."
On a night when the Yankees' Robinson Cano was repeatedly booed and went homerless, Fielder put on the most powerful display among baseball's big boppers. Winner at St. Louis' Busch Stadium three years ago, Fielder had a total of 28 home runs over three rounds to cap the main event on the eve of the All-Star Game. He hit the four longest drives of the night, including a pair at 476 feet.
"They were far," he said. "That's not easy to hit it out there."
While the ball stayed out of McCovey Cove during the 2007 Derby at San Francisco's AT&T Park and the right-field swimming pool last year at Chase Field in Phoenix, there was plenty of aquatic activity in Kansas City, second only to Rome for most fountains in cities around the world.
After three splash shots among his five homers in the first round, Fielder started off the second round as the setting sun lit up clouds in a pretty pink behind the left-field wall. His mop of dreadlocks visible as he hit without a helmet, Fielder deposited four more balls into the 322-foot-wide water spectacular, which by then was illuminated in the twilight.
He added another water drive in the final round, then leaned against one of his sons while he watched Bautista swing.
"I'm a little disappointed," Bautista said. "I'm capable of doing more. I had a lot of fun doing it."
When he won three years ago in St. Louis, Fielder's 23 homers included a 503-foot drive that disappeared between two sections of bleachers in right-center. Griffey won titles in 1994 at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, 1998 at Denver's Coors Field and 1999 at Boston's Fenway Park.
Cano set a final-round record of 12 en route to last year's title in Phoenix, where he hit 32 overall. This year he was the object of loud booing throughout by fans upset he didn't select the Royals' Billy Butler after promising to take a hometown player for his derby team.
Fans chanted "Bil-ly Butler!" in between their boos. When it was over, Cano got hugs from Boston's David Ortiz and Yankees teammates Curtis Granderson and CC Sabathia.
"I was criticized before I got here. If you play for the Yankees you get booed everywhere you go," Cano said.
It was the 17th time a player went homerless in the Derby, the first since Detroit's Brandon Inge in 2009.
Granderson tweeted, "that was the most interesting reaction to a home (run) derby i've ever seen, but the fans were excited which is all that counts."
Carlos Gonzalez and Andrew McCutchen (four each) and Matt Kemp (one) also were dropped after the first round.
Carlos Beltran (12) was dropped after the second round, when Mark Trumbo and Bautista were tied with 13 apiece, leading to a swingoff won by Bautista 2-1.
Trumbo and Bautista each managed to put a drive into the small fountain beyond the left-field wall. Trumbo also hit a pair of shots over the Royals Hall of Fame in left, toward Interstate 70.

So much for Puig-mania sweeping the country. Give this contest to Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman.
Freeman and Toronto reliever Steve Delabar won the fan voting for the final spots in next week's All-Star Game, meaning Los Angeles Dodgers sensation Yasiel Puig is likely headed for a few days off after a terrific stretch to begin his major league career.
Freeman set a record with 19.7 million votes, and Puig was second. Major League Baseball didn't release the vote total for Puig, but said the Cuban defector also surpassed the previous record for the final vote of 15.6 million for Shane Victorino in 2009.
"It's unbelievable," Freeman said. "I'm kind of speechless. I wouldn't be here without the fans and I just saw that it's 19.7 million votes. It's incredible and it's just a dream come true."
Freeman was taking ground balls during batting practice before Atlanta's home game against Cincinnati on Thursday night when general manager Frank Wren called him over and told him about his first All-Star selection. The slugger is batting .307 with nine homers and 56 RBIs in 78 games.
"I never, ever thought that I would make one," Freeman said. "I just wanted to get to the big leagues, and when I got here I just wanted to win ballgames. All-Star games were not on my mind.
"To win this is just beyond me."
Puig won't get to play in Tuesday's game at Citi Field in New York unless he is added as an injury replacement. The outfielder was batting .394 with eight homers and 19 RBIs heading into Thursday night's home game against Colorado, helping the Dodgers shoot up the NL West standings following a slow start.
"I'm happy with it," Puig said. "It's not what I expected for the team and for the city, but I've just got to keep on playing. I'm very happy. I don't have my head down at all. I want to congratulate Freddie for winning."
Puig has been in the majors for only five weeks, leading some to question whether he belongs on the NL team.
"I think he'd love to be at the All-Star Game," Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. "I think he's the kind of kid who'd love to go show off, but the All-Star thing is not going to take his joy away."
The final vote for the AL team also had its share of controversy, with Tigers manager Jim Leyland nominating five middle relievers for the spot. There was some talk about whether the list should have included more high-profile players, since the All-Star Game is essentially geared toward the fans.
Delabar won with 9.6 million votes. The right-hander is 5-1 with a 1.74 ERA in 37 appearances for the Blue Jays.
The Braves and Blue Jays had partnered up in the process, asking fans to vote for each other's player.
The other players on the list included righties David Robertson of the Yankees, Joaquin Benoit of the Tigers, Koji Uehara of the Red Sox, and Tanner Scheppers of the Rangers.
Freeman and Puig finished ahead of San Francisco outfielder Hunter Pence, Washington shortstop Ian Desmond, and Los Angeles first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.
MLB said a record 79.2 million votes were cast between the two leagues, easily cruising past the previous record of 68.6 million from 2009. Votes were cast through text message, Twitter and MLB.com.

ATLANTA -- Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman will not play in the All-Star Game after jamming his left thumb.
General manager Frank Wren said Sunday that Freeman's injury will keep him out of the game.
Freeman jammed his left thumb on the first play of Saturday night's 5-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds. Shortstop Andrelton Simmons fielded Chris Heisey's grounder and threw slightly wide of first base, forcing Freeman to catch the ball in Heisey's path. Heisey hit Freeman's glove and was out.
"I guess my thumb was in the wrong place," Freeman said. "It's just one of those freak injuries I seem to run into every year."
Freeman remained in the game. He wore a soft splint on his left hand and is not playing in Sunday's game.
He said there is "a little bit of tiny swelling" in the thumb.
"I can still bend it and do everything," Freeman said. "It's not too bad, so I'm just going to take a day off and see how it goes."
Freeman made the All-Star roster by finishing ahead of Dodgers rookie Yasiel Puig on the fan vote. Freeman will still make the trip to New York for the All-Star Game.
Puig did not make the final NL roster. Manager Bruce Bochy instead selected Braves catcher Brian McCann on Sunday.
Before the decision was made that Freeman would not play in the All-Star Game, he said the priority is protecting his health for the NL East-leading Braves.
"I've got to look out for the best interests of this team, so I've got to be available to play in the second half," Freeman said. "If I can't play in the All-Star Game, we're better off if I'm able to play in the second half."
Manager Fredi Gonzalez said Freeman can receive treatment for the injury while at the All-Star Game.
"I think he needs to go," Gonzalez said. "... You never know when that chance will come again."
Evan Gattis, who had been out since June 18 with a right oblique strain, was activated from the 15-day disabled list and is starting at first base.
Gattis came off the DL after playing only two games in his injury rehabilitation stint with Triple-A Gwinnett. The original plan had been for Gattis to remain with Gwinnett through Sunday.
"It was good," Gattis said of his rehab stint. "I felt good to square up the ball last night. That tells me I'm ready."
Gattis, whose primary position is catcher, has started 11 games in left field and only three games at first base.
B.J. Upton, who left Friday night's game with a right adductor muscle strain, was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Saturday.
"We've got a break coming up and I just need a little more time to get healthy," Upton said, adding his recovery "is not a thing that's going to happen immediately."
Justin Upton also left Friday night's game with what was announced as a left calf strain. On Sunday, Gonzalez said team doctors concluded the injury was just a severe cramp.
Gonzalez said Justin Upton would be available in an emergency situation Sunday.
The Braves expect a third injured starting outfielder, Jason Heyward, to recover from his strained right hamstring without being placed on the disabled list.
The Braves' patchwork outfield of Jose Constanza, Reed Johnson and rookie Joey Terdoslavich combined for seven hits Saturday night and is starting again Sunday.

NEW YORK -- Right-hander Matt Harvey's first full season in the majors has been highlighted by three flirtations with no-hitters, New York Mets fans anointing days he pitches as "Harvey Day," and a photo shoot for ESPN The Magazine's "Body Issue." It also will include becoming the first major league pitcher in nine years to start an All-Star Game in his home ballpark.
National League manager Bruce Bochy named Harvey as the NL starter for Tuesday night's game at Citi Field. American League counterpart Jim Leyland said his own guy, Detroit Tigers right-hander Max Scherzer, will start for the AL.
The last pitcher to start an All-Star Game in his home ballpark was Roger Clemens with Houston in 2004.
Harvey will join Clemens as well as Esteban Loaiza (Chicago, 2003), Pedro Martinez (Boston, 1999) and Steve Rogers (Montreal, 1982) as the only pitchers to start an All-Star Game at home since expansion in 1961, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
"What a tremendous year he's had," Bochy said of Harvey. "It really wouldn't have mattered what city we were playing in; with the year that he's had, the impressive numbers that he's put up, he would have been the starting pitcher."
Among NL qualifiers, Harvey ranks first in strikeouts (147), second in WHIP (0.92) and third in ERA (2.35) and opponent batting average (.196). He has taken three no-hit bids into the seventh inning this season. Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star Clayton Kershaw didn't sound pleased with Bochy saying Harvey merited starting regardless of venue, tersely saying that was Bochy's opinion. Kershaw tops MLB ERA at 1.98 and WHIP at 0.91.
Kershaw added he would enjoy starting an All-Star Game.
"It's not a goal. I don't really set goals," Kershaw said. "I don't have any goals. It would be cool. I would like to do it. It would be fun."
Harvey said he came into the season motivated to step up and fill the void created by reigning Cy Young winner R.A. Dickey's departure. Dickey was traded to the Blue Jays in December.
"It was a role I wanted to take and something I took pride in," Harvey said. "Having this opportunity and getting the nod is one step closer. I'm very proud of it, and obviously it's more drive to keep going and hopefully not make this my last All-Star Game."
Bochy and Leyland also announced their starting lineups. The NL will have Cincinnati second baseman Brandon Phillips leading off, followed by St. Louis right fielder Carlos Beltran, Reds first baseman Joey Votto and Mets third baseman David Wright,
"Now if you're the captain of the Home Run Derby you have to hit cleanup," Bochy joked, referring to Wright.
Colorado left fielder Carlos Gonzalez, will anchor the bottom of the NL lineup, followed by Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, Colorado designated hitter Michael Cuddyer and Washington center fielder Bryce Harper.
The AL will have the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout in left field and leading off, followed by New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano, Detroit third baseman Miguel Cabrera, Baltimore first baseman Chris Davis, Toronto right fielder Jose Bautista, Boston designated hitter David Ortiz, Orioles center fielder Adam Jones, Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer and Baltimore shortstop J.J. Hardy.
Mets officials had Harvey skip his final first-half start, Saturday in Pittsburgh. The Mets portrayed the motivation as limiting Harvey's season-innings count and allowing a blister to heal, not to preserve his eligibility to start the All-Star Game. Mets manager Terry Collins said Sunday that Harvey's blister, underneath the nail on the ace's right index finger, has healed.
Harvey's innings count will be capped at about 220 this season; his current stands at 130 innings.
It marks the fourth time a Met has started an All-Star Game at pitcher. Harvey joins Dwight Gooden (1986 and '88) and Tom Seaver (1970). Harvey becomes the first Met selected in his first full season in the majors since Gooden and Darryl Strawberry in 1984, although Strawberry got 420 at-bats the previous season.
Gooden has been tweeting Harvey's strikeout total during games each time Harvey records a K this season.
"The support that Doc's been giving me all year has been pretty special," Harvey said. "To be named with those two guys, they're two of the best."

MINNEAPOLIS -- Derek Jeter soaked in the adulation from fans and players during one more night on baseball's national stage, set the tone for the American League with a pregame speech, and then delivered two final All-Star hits.
Mike Trout, perhaps the top candidate to succeed the 40-year-old Yankees captain as the face of the game, seemed ready to assume the role with a tiebreaking triple and later a go-ahead double that earned the 22-year-old MVP honors.
On a summer evening filled with reminders of generational change, the AL kept up nearly two decades of dominance by beating the National League 5-3 on Tuesday for its 13th win in 17 years.
"I think let Mike be Mike. I don't think people have to necessarily appoint someone to a particular position," Jeter said. "He's got a bright future ahead of him. I don't know how much better he can get, but if he consistently does what he's doing, then he will be here for a long time."
The 85th All-Star Game, a 5-3 victory for the AL, belonged to Derek Jeter and Mike Trout. It was their night. It was their moment.
Whether Adam Wainwright grooved a pitch to Derek Jeter or not, it gets to the problem of what the All-Star Game is really for and if it should "count," Jerry Crasnick writes.
Derek Jeter got a groovy ending, while MVP Mike Trout might have taken the torch from his childhood hero, David Schoenfield writes.
Miguel Cabrera hit a two-run homer to help give the AL champion home-field advantage for the World Series.
No matter what else happened, from the start it seemed destined to be another special event for Jeter.
He made a diving stop on Andrew McCutchen's grounder to shortstop leading off the game and nearly threw him out at first, then received a 63-second standing ovation when he walked to the plate before his opposite-field double to right leading off the bottom half. He was given another rousing cheer before his single to right starting the third and 2 1/2 minutes more applause after AL manager John Farrell sent Alexei Ramirez to shortstop to replace him at the start of the fourth.
As Frank Sinatra's recording of "New York, New York" boomed over the Target Field speakers and his parents watched from the stands, Jeter repeatedly waved to the crowd, exchanged handshakes and hugs with just about every person in the AL dugout, and then went back onto the field for a curtain call.
"It was a special moment and it was unscripted," Jeter said. "I was unaware of it."
NL manager Mike Matheny of the Cardinals didn't want it to stop.
"The guys on our side have the utmost respect for him and would like to have been standing out there for a little while longer," he said. "I think Derek was the one that was uncomfortable with it."
While not as flashy as Mariano Rivera's All-Star farewell at Citi Field last year, when all the other players left the great reliever alone on the field for an eighth-inning solo bow, Jeter tried not to make a fuss and to deflect the attention.
Even during his clubhouse speech.
"He just wanted to thank us," Trout said. "You know, we should be thanking him."
A 14-time All-Star who was MVP of the 2000 game in Atlanta, Jeter announced in February that this will be his final season. His hits left him with a .481 All-Star average (13-for-27), just behind Charlie Gehringer's .500 record (10-for-20) for players with 20 or more at-bats.
While the Yankees are at .500 at the break and in danger of missing the postseason in consecutive years for the first time in two decades, Jeter and the Angels' Trout gave a boost to whichever AL team reaches the World Series.
The AL improved to 9-3 since the All-Star Game started deciding which league gets World Series home-field advantage; 23 of the past 28 titles were won by teams scheduled to host four of a possible seven games.
Detroit's Max Scherzer, in line to be the most-prized free-agent pitcher after the season, pitched a scoreless fifth for the win, and Glen Perkins got the save in his home ballpark.
Target Field, a $545 million, limestone-encased jewel that opened in 2010, produced an All-Star cycle just eight batters in, with hitters showing off flashy neon-bright spikes and fielders wearing All-Star caps with special designs for the first time.
With the late sunset -- the sky didn't darken until the fifth inning, well after 9 p.m. -- there was bright sunshine when Jeter was cheered before his first at-bat. He was introduced by a recording of late Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard's deep monotone. St. Louis pitcher Adam Wainwright left his glove on the mound and backed up toward second, clapping along with the crowd of 41,048.
"I tried to tell him to pick it up -- let's go," Jeter said. "But he took a moment and let the fans give me an ovation which I will always remember."
When Jeter finally stepped into the batter's box, he took a ball and lined a 90 mph cutter down the right-field line for a double.
"I was going to give him a couple pipe shots just to -- he deserved it," Wainwright said. "I thought he was going to hit something hard to the right side for a single or an out. I probably should have pitched him a little bit better."
After those in-game remarks created a stir on the Internet, Wainwright amended himself, saying: "It was mis-said. I hope people realize I'm not intentionally giving up hits out there."
Trout, who finished second to Cabrera in AL MVP voting in each of the past two seasons, became the youngest All-Star MVP, about 3 1/2 months younger than Ken Griffey Jr. was in 1992.
Playing in his third All-Star Game, Trout followed Jeter in the first by tripling off the right-field wall. Cabrera's homer -- just the fourth in the past six All-Star games -- made it 3-0, but the NL tied it on consecutive RBI doubles by Chase Utley and Jonathan Lucroy off Jon Lester in the second and Lucroy's run-scoring double against Chris Sale in the fourth.
Trout put the AL ahead for good with an RBI double in the fifth -- a bouncer over third base against Pat Neshek, the St. Louis reliever who grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs and started his career with the Twins. Jose Altuve followed with a sacrifice fly off Tyler Clippard.
Raised in New Jersey, Trout saw a lot of Jeter and said all week he felt honored to play alongside him.
"Growing up I was setting goals to myself that when I get -- if I ever get the chance to get -- to the big leagues, that's how I want to play," Trout said. "And the way he carries himself on and off the field, how he respects the game -- always hustling, it doesn't matter what the score is. If they are down 10 runs, he is always running the ball out. That's how I want to play."
NOTES: The NL holds a 43-40 advantage, with ties in 1961 and 2002. ... Neshek's brother works on the grounds crew at Target Field.

Once upon a time, Japanese baseball was thought to be a pale imitation of the stateside major league game. Then came the inaugural World Baseball Classic.
Once upon a time, it was only the rare Japanese player who would dare to cross the Pacific and try his hand in the bigs. Now comes an offseason in which Daisuke Matsuzaka, Kei Igawa and Akinori Iwamura have all come over to take a shot.
It's a new era, friends. Times are changing.
Even if the posting system stays in place (which is far from a lock), we will see more of this -- more parity, more player crossovers -- in the years to come. So it's time to start keeping a much closer eye on the players and teams in Japan.
Don't know where to start? No worries. Here are 10 players to watch, 10 guys (in no particular order) you've never heard of, but who could go household in the global baseball era.
Norichika Aoki, CF
Tokyo Yakult Swallows
5-foot-8, 165 pounds, age 25

Like his idol, Ichiro Suzuki, Aoki hits the ball to all fields and shows great speed on the basepaths. As a rookie in 2005, he won a Central League batting title and collected 202 hits (only the second Japanese player to ever get 200 hits; Ichiro was the other), and in his second season, the young center fielder drastically reduced his strikeouts (113 to 78), hit .321/.396/.439, stole 41 bases and scored 112 runs.
Yu Darvish, P
Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters
6-4, 175 pounds, age 20

He won the clinching fifth game of the 2006 Japan Series and was MVP of the 2006 Konami Cup Asia Series (a tournament featuring the club champions from Japan, Taiwan and Korea, and the Chinese national team). Tall and thin, with matinee idol good looks, he's extremely marketable. Add to that the fact that he features a low- to mid-90s fastball, a plus curve and seems, even at a very young age, to be utterly unflappable, and you have (if he's posted) the next big bidding war.
Tsuyoshi Nishioka, SS/2B
Chiba Lotte Marines 
5-11, 165 pounds, age 22

He's now a slick-fielding, full-time shortstop for the Marines, but he's won a Japanese Gold Glove at second base as well. The switch-hitter's offensive numbers are thin so far, but he's just 22, and like the Mets' Jose Reyes, he ups his value with the stolen bases (33 in 2006 and 41 in 2005). It may be a while before he gets a shot to play in the major leagues, but at 21 he was a key contributor to Japan's World Baseball Classic championship, so we can all look forward to watching him tear up the next WBC in 2009, as he nears his prime.
Kazumi Saito, P
Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks
6-3, 220 pounds, age 29

It's this guy, not Daisuke Matsuzaka, who was the best pitcher in Japan last season, posting a 1.75 ERA over 201 innings and going 18-5. According to some close observers of the Japanese baseball scene, at age 29 he's a good bet to be posted soon, particularly if Boston's Matsuzaka experiment works out.
Kosuke Fukudome, 3B/OF
Chunichi Dragons
5-11, 188 pounds, age 29

He'll actually be 30 when the 2007 season begins, but as the defending Central League MVP and one of the few contemporary Japanese hitters with serious pop (28 and 31 HR, 103 and 104 RBI, the past two seasons), he has to be considered a hot prospect. That's especially true because he'll be a free agent after the 2007 season and has hinted strongly that he'll give it a whirl in the bigs. Even if the power numbers don't translate, expect major league teams to be very interested in an OBP north of .400 four of the last six seasons.
Yuki Saito, P
Waseda University 
5-9, 154 pounds, age 18
They call him The Handkerchief Prince because as a high school senior, while pitching four complete games in four days (including a 15-inning, 1-1 tie) to lead Tokyo's Waseda Jitsugyo to the 2006 high school national championship, he repeatedly, dramatically wiped his sweaty brow with a blue, terry cloth handkerchief. Teeny-boppers pined. Middle-aged mothers swooned. Like young Elvis with the hips, he killed, and like John, Paul, George and Ringo, he became a phenomenon. But he's no flash in the pan: Mets scout Isao Ojimi calls him "a first-rate pitcher," and he seems to have the classic Japanese combination of heart, stuff and creativity on the hill. What makes him most interesting, though, is that he's gone to a university rather than play Japanese professional baseball. This means he'll be a free agent when he graduates in 2010 (no waiting to be posted), and could join a major league team at just 23, with his entire career in front of him.
Toshiaki Imae, 3B
Chiba Lotte Marines
5-10, 177 pounds, age 23

He's a tale of two seasons: In 2005, as a 21-year-old rookie given the full-time third base job, he won a  Gold Glove, posted an .804 OPS, and played his way onto the World Baseball Classic roster. In 2006, he fell way off, looking lost at the plate, showing no power, and putting up a meek .267/.293/.389 overall line. He has speed (see the 60 doubles the past two years), but to play third base in the major leagues, or even in Bobby Valentine's everyday lineup for Chiba Lotte, he's hoping 2005 was the true story.
Kyuji Fujikawa, RP
Hanshin Tigers 
6-1, 169 pounds, age 26

Literally born into baseball, his name means "Baseball Child," and was given to him because he was born the day after his father pitched a no-hitter in a Japanese amateur league. He throws five pitches for strikes, and in 2005, his second full season as a contributor for the Tigers, he became a dominant middle reliever, throwing 92 innings in 80 appearances, giving up just 57 hits, and posting an ERA of 1.37. The part that will make U.S. scouts salivate? His K/9 ratio was a gobsmacking 13.59. The part that will make them linger at their windows and cry, waiting for him to one day land on American shores? In 2006, he went out and proved it was no fluke, posting a tidy little 13.52 K/9.
Takashi Toritani, SS
Hanshin Tigers
6-0, 180 pounds, age 25

A superstar in both high school (at the national Koshien tournament) and college (at Waseda University, where he won the triple crown as a sophomore), he entered the Japanese professional leagues with the greatest of buzz and expectations. Many compared him to Derek Jeter, everyone raved about his capacity to perform in the clutch. So far in the pros, though, it's been a waiting game, as he's been merely steady at the plate, and a bit ragged in the field (21 errors last season for Hanshin). Local experts are split on him now: Some say it will never happen, he was just a hyped creation, while others say his breakout season is just around the corner.
Koji Uehara, P
Yomiuri Giants
6-1, 187 pounds, age 32

Too old to be considered a prospect, but he's a free agent after the 2007 season and will likely pitch in the majors in 2008. The ace of the Giants' staff, he features a great career K/BB ratio (6.50/1) and has gone 94-45 with a 2.99 ERA in seven seasons. The Anaheim Angels of Los Angeles made a play for him coming out of college, so look for them to be in the running again come this winter.

Baseball's general managers usually have a week after the World Series before gathering at a plush resort in some warm-weather site for their annual meetings. Not this year.
The Phillies' parade is barely over and Chase Utley's farewell expletive is still ringing in our ears, and the game's executives have already arrived in Dana Point, Calif., for three days of salary arbitration meetings, rules discussions, early trade talks and private audiences with Scott Boras.
This is always a chaotic time of year in baseball, but these GM meetings seems particularly intriguing. The free-agent crop features some formidable bats (Mark Teixeira and Manny Ramirez), a record-setting closer (Francisco Rodriguez), a front-of-the-rotation horse (CC Sabathia) and lots of established starting pitching behind him.
Will the sputtering economy have an impact on baseball's average salary? Most people in the game expect the big stars to get paid, but the riches won't be quite as abundant for the middle-rung and fringe players. And as usual, teams will explore their trade options before shelling out big money for free agents.
As the hot stove season gets under way, ESPN.com surveyed 15 general managers, assistant GMs, baseball operations people and scouts on seven notable questions that will play out in the coming weeks. Here are their responses:
Responses: New York Yankees 12, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 1, Los Angeles Dodgers 1, "no idea" 1.
The Brewers are making a sincere effort to bring back Sabathia, and the pitcher's heart is pointing him toward his native California. But the overwhelming sentiment is that the Yankees will open the vault, lure Sabathia to the Bronx and christen him their staff ace and Opening Day starter in 2009.
The Yankees exercised restraint and long-term thinking last winter, lost out to the Mets in the Johan Santana sweepstakes and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1993. With Hank Steinbrenner getting antsy and the coffers flush with new stadium revenue, the consensus is that the Yankees will do whatever it takes to land Sabathia.
Indeed, we heard the phrase "whatever it takes" a half dozen times.
"I don't see how the Yankees don't blow every other team out of the water, financially," said a National League front-office man.
The estimates of Sabathia's deal range from a low of five years and $125 million to a high of six years and $180 million. One executive predicted New York could go as high as eight years.
While Yankee love reigned supreme, one AL official makes a compelling case for the Dodgers.
"They have lots of money coming off the books, with a lot of cheap young players filling critical spots," the official said. "Throw in the fact that they're an NL club in his home [state] with [potentially] two rotation spots to fill, and I think it makes the most sense."
Responses: Los Angeles Dodgers 10, New York Mets 4, New York Yankees 1.
Manny Ramirez made his priorities clear at the end of the National League Championship Series when he told reporters that he plans to go to the highest bidder. "The [price of] gasoline is up, so I'm up," said Ramirez -- jokingly, according to reporters who were present.
Actually, the price of gasoline has declined in recent weeks, but Ramirez seems like a good bet to surpass the $20 million annually that he received in his last free-agent deal with Boston eight years ago.
Stock in Manny was down in late July, when Ramirez was vilified for dogging it in Boston. His profile went up when he hit .396 in August and September in leading the Dodgers to the playoffs and past the Cubs in the Division Series. Now Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and GM Ned Colletti are going to have a tough time saying no.
"Manny is still an offensive force, big-time," said an AL assistant GM. "At times he's not in the best condition, and he can shut it down, so there's a risk to him. But after what he did for that team -- turning their season around -- the Dodgers are going to have a hard time explaining to their fans that they didn't get it done."
The Mets need to find a closer to replace Billy Wagner and some help for the rotation, so they might not have the cash to bid on Ramirez. Surprisingly, none of our survey respondents mentioned the Phillies, who are considered a potential Ramirez suitor because of manager Charlie Manuel's relationship with Ramirez and the team's need for a left fielder if Pat Burrell leaves town.
The estimates for Ramirez's contract range from a low of three years and $55 million to a high of five years and $105 million. Several respondents predicted three years and $80 million.
Responses: 13 say Peavy will be traded, 2 say no.
Possible destinations: Atlanta 9, Dodgers 1, St. Louis 1, Cubs 1. The other "yes" voter said the Padres will trade Peavy "to anyone who'll give them four prospects."
Padres general manager Kevin Towers seems awfully motivated. He has a legitimate No. 1 starter, with a team that's not going to contend and a mandate to keep the payroll in line; Jake Peavy could bring several promising young players in return.
"Based on what I've seen, it sure sounds like [there'll be a deal]," said a National League scout. "There's been quite a bit of smoke."
The Braves are the popular choice for a number of reasons. They've been the most aggressive suitor, and they have enough young talent to satisfy the Padres even after digging deep into the system to acquire Mark Teixeira a year ago. San Diego will have a tough time prying loose pitcher Tommy Hanson, who's tearing up the Arizona Fall League, or 19-year-old outfield prospect Jason Heyward, but there's more in Atlanta's cupboard.
Peavy has a no-trade clause and will probably waive it for only a select few clubs. The Cubs' interest could hinge on whether Ryan Dempster returns or leaves through free agency. The Astros, Dodgers and Cardinals are also on Peavy's most desirable list, but Houston and St. Louis don't match up with San Diego, talentwise.
If the Padres try to move Peavy to a place he doesn't prefer, he can either decline to waive his no-trade clause or ask for more money to sweeten the deal. Peavy's contract with San Diego guarantees him $60 million over the next four years, and the Padres have a $22 million club option for 2013.
Responses: 9 say Holliday will be traded, 6 say no.
Possible destinations: Boston 1, Philadelphia 1, Washington 1, New York Mets 1, Cleveland 1, Arizona 1, and 3 "not sure."
The responses to this one are all over the map. While Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd has vowed to be aggressive this winter, he's walking a fine line between "retooling" and trying to compete with a club that's just a year removed from the World Series.
Some observers think O'Dowd is more likely to trade third baseman Garrett Atkins. Atkins is two years away from free agency, and the Rockies could shed a big salary while handing over the position to prospect Ian Stewart.
While no one questions Matt Holliday's ability, he has a 1.068 career on base-slugging percentage at Coors Field and an .803 OPS on the road. And clubs who talked to O'Dowd about Holliday during the 2008 season got the impression that the Rockies will have to be bowled over to trade him.
"I'm not sure that anyone gives up the necessary package for a one-year Scott Boras client with a big home-road split," said an AL executive.
O'Dowd did a nice job in the Jason Jennings trade two years ago, acquiring Willy Taveras, Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh from Houston. But after the success that Boston, Tampa Bay and Colorado have had in bringing young players along the past two years, no team is in a rush to move top prospects for rentals these days.
Responses: Lowe 9, Burnett 6.
Derek Lowe, Ryan Dempster and A.J. Burnett (once he exercises his opt-out clause) are generally regarded as the best starting pitchers on the market after Sabathia. The conventional wisdom, right or wrong, is that Dempster will wind up back with the Cubs.  So which of the other two would executives prefer?
Burnett, 31, is 3½ years younger than Lowe and has the high-octane stuff. He established career highs this year with 221 1/3 innings and 34 starts, and posted an 18-10 record against superior competition in the American League East.
Burnett has found a nice comfort zone in Toronto. He has slid in at No. 2 behind Roy Halladay in the Blue Jays' rotation, and he has an excellent working relationship with pitching coach Brad Arnsberg. Although Burnett hasn't ruled out New York, Boston or any of the other big markets, some executives think he might want to give strong consideration to staying in Toronto.
While Lowe turned 35 in June, he is lithe and athletic, and he has yet to appear on the disabled list in the majors. "His stuff this year was as good as it's ever been," said a National League GM. Still, Lowe's 2.60 ground-ball to fly-ball ratio was his worst since his rookie year in 1997.
Since Lowe has been a closer, his next team could always consider using him in a relief role down the road if needed. As a sinkerballer, he might be better equipped to get by if his radar gun readings decline a tick.
In the end, the choice comes down to a matter of taste. Do you prefer the older, "safer" choice, or the younger guy who performs like a No. 1 when he's on his game?
"I'd take Lowe," said an NL front-office man. "His age doesn't bother me as much as Burnett's entire injury portfolio."
"Burnett by a mile," said an AL executive. "He'll be 35 in the last year of the deal whereas Lowe will be 39 at the end of the deal. It's not close for me."
Responses: Burrell 8, Abreu 7.
Pat Burrell is 2½ years younger and hits with more power. He has averaged 28 homers and 92 RBIs in nine seasons with the Phillies.
Bobby Abreu, who turns 35 in spring training, has a higher career on-base percentage than Burrell (.405 to .367) and 318 career stolen bases to Burrell's five.
While 24 of Abreu's 36 homers over the past two seasons have come at Yankee Stadium, Burrell isn't as big a beneficiary of Citizens Bank Park's cozy dimensions as you might think; since the park opened five years ago, Burrell has 74 home runs in Philadelphia and 74 on the road.
"He's like a Troy Glaus," said an American League executive. "When he hits 'em, he hits 'em. It doesn't matter where he's playing."
Although Abreu is regarded within the industry as slightly better defensively, neither player is much of a bargain with a glove. Statistician John Dewan's plus-minus system ranked Abreu as the second-worst right fielder in the game in 2008 (ahead of Colorado's Brad Hawpe) and Burrell as the second-worst left fielder in the game (ahead of Minnesota's Delmon Young.
"At least Abreu moves better," said a National League executive. "Burrell looks as if he's running on glass."
One big difference: While Burrell is prone to white-hot stretches followed by prolonged slumps, Abreu is a more consistent producer. As Yankees hitting coach Kevin Long said earlier this year, "Bobby's always going to put something in the basket." That might be a walk, a stolen base, an extra-base hit or a three-hit day.
Burrell made a run at the All-Star team with a .979 OPS before the break, then slumped to a .215 average after the break. It's not the first time he's vanished for an extended period.
Responses: 14 say yes, and one says yes only on the condition that Griffey is willing to accept a reduced role. "I doubt any team would commit everyday at-bats to him," the executive said.
Potential destinations: Seattle 8, Tampa Bay 1, Oakland 1, Atlanta 1, New York Mets 1, Chicago White Sox 1, and 2 "not sure."
Ken Griffey Jr. hit three home runs in 131 at-bats after joining the White Sox in a deadline trade with Cincinnati and had difficulty covering ground in center field. It has since come to light that he was playing on 1½ legs. Griffey had his left knee drained three times last season -- twice in Cincinnati and once in Chicago -- and underwent arthroscopic surgery for some minor repairs last month.
Seattle is the obvious choice for 2009, since it would allow Griffey to come full circle and complete his career on a heartwarming note. Griffey could play right field, first base and DH, help replace some of Raul Ibanez's offense, provide a bridge to outfield prospects Greg Halman and Michael Saunders, and generate some goodwill for a team that's badly in need of it.
The question is: Will new GM Jack Zduriencik make the call, or is this an "organizational" decision?
"It seems that upper management makes a lot of the calls there, and I imagine he'd be pretty good for PR and ticket sales," said an AL general manager.
Oakland merits a mention because GM Billy Beane seems to have a soft spot for accomplished hitters in the twilight of their careers. The A's have taken the plunge on Frank Thomas, Mike Piazza and Mike Sweeney in recent years, with mixed results.
Tampa also could make sense if Cliff Floyd's shoulder injury prompts him to call it quits. Griffey lives in Orlando and might be energized playing alongside B.J. Upton and all those talented young players on the Rays' roster. Griffey has 2,680 career hits and might need to play three more years to reach the 3,000-hit milestone.
Griffey and his agent, Brian Goldberg, have never been hard-liners in negotiations, and Junior might be willing to go for a deal in the $5 million range with some incentives. Believe it or not, this is the first time in Griffey's 20-year career that he's a free agent.

GOODYEAR, Ariz. -- With the fervor of an angry mime, Reds pitching coach Bryan Price imitated a delivery toward home plate in the Cincinnati bullpen. First, Price lifted his leg slowly, then twisted his hips before finally finishing with a fury toward home.
"Trust location," Price told Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto.
For the next few moments, Price instructed Cueto where to land after his delivery. While throwing a pitch during the bullpen session, Cueto had landed to the left of the mound, while Price wanted him to land directly in front.
Cueto nodded intently.
Almost three years after making a spectacular debut for the Reds -- a sparkling one-hit, seven-inning outing against the Arizona Diamondbacks in April 2008 -- Cueto, 24, remains frustratingly maddening: brilliantly skilled, but wildly inconsistent.
This year, more than ever, the Reds need Cueto to take the next step toward stardom. While Aroldis Chapman has gotten most of the attention this spring, and Aaron Harang was given the Opening Day start, Cueto may hold the Reds' playoff chances in his powerful right arm. Nestled between Harang and Bronson Arroyo in the No. 2 spot in the Cincinnati rotation, the Reds are clearly asking Cueto to grow up.
Last year, Cueto raced to an 8-6 record with a 3.62 ERA in the first half of the year, but sputtered to a 3-5 record with a 5.81 ERA in the second half.
"I was a little tired because I had pitched so much," Cueto said. "First it was winter league, then the World Baseball Classic and then spring training and then the regular season. My arm was so tired that my ball had no life to it."
To prevent fatigue, this offseason the Reds prohibited Cueto from pitching in winter league. Already, Cueto said he notices a difference. The Reds say they are simply being cautious, since -- for many -- Cueto's slight stature (5-foot-10) lends to him becoming fatigued early.
Cueto's size has been a concern for years. In fact, it almost kept him from playing professional baseball.
At the tail end of 2003, a Dominican Republic trainer known around Latin baseball circles as "El Mago" ("The Magician") had an outfield prospect who could not hit, run or field particularly well. This, of course, was troubling for a businessman like El Mago. But the boy, named Johnny Cueto, threw the ball well from the outfield, so El Mago decided to turn him into a pitcher to see if he could turn a profit.
The boy quickly took to pitching, and by early 2004, he threw 91-92 mph. Yet teams shied away from Cueto because of his slight stature and thin frame. Some scouts thought Cueto had lied about his age, because what 18-year-old boy with his frame could throw so hard? Meanwhile, the boy's parents simply encouraged him to continue to work hard.
The boy learned not to be discouraged. Though he didn't usually like to watch television, Johnny always made sure to watch all of Pedro Martinez's starts for the Boston Red Sox. Cueto was encouraged to see that if Martinez could make it in the majors at his size, perhaps he could too.
One day, El Mago set up a workout for Cueto with the Red Sox.
"Look," El Mago told Boston scouts, "I've brought you the second coming of Pedro Martinez."
That day Cueto threw 92 mph, yet that was not enough to impress Boston's scouts. They offered him so little that Johnny's father told him, "Even I could give you that much money."


“

We're just trying to add some discipline, maintain a delivery and thought process throughout the course of an outing. What we want is a consistency and reliability to his pitches.
”

At that point, almost everyone involved had gotten desperate. One night, El Mago called then-Reds scout Luis Baez.
"I have a prospect for you," El Mago told him.
Baez did not have the authority to sign players. Luckily, though, Johnny Almaraz -- the Reds' Latin American scouting director at the time -- was in the Dominican Republic. But there was a catch: Almaraz had an 11 a.m. flight the next day, so Cueto would have to appear for an early-morning workout.
At 7 a.m. the next day, Cueto threw 10-15 pitches, all of them clocked between 91-92 mph.
"I didn't even care about his size," Baez said. "We just saw the ability."
The Reds invited Cueto to their Dominican academy, where he spent the next two weeks training with Cincinnati coaches. Almost each day Cueto's mother Cristina showed up to check up on her boy.
Baez saw Cueto throw several bullpen sessions during that time and sent his reports to Almaraz. Shortly after, Almaraz decided to sign Cueto for $35,000 based on Baez's reports and the 10-15 pitches he saw during that early-morning workout.
"We told [Cueto] that we thought he could be a major leaguer quickly," Baez said.
In just three minor league seasons, Cueto was 29-15 with a 3.28 ERA. In his rookie year for the Reds in 2008, Cueto was 9-14 with a 4.81 ERA. Many expected him to make a big jump in 2009, but his fatigued arm did not allow it. A recent study by FanGraphs.com noted that in 2009 Cueto's swinging strike rate dropped (10.1 percent to 7.5 percent) and that his slider did not break as much, seemingly signs of a tired pitcher.
Reds catcher Ramon Hernandez said at times last year, Cueto's whole body appeared fatigued: His shoulders slumped, his arm hung limp and his head bowed.
"In the fifth inning of a lot of starts you noticed that he couldn't pitch anymore," Hernandez said.
But it's likely that Cueto's size isn't what caused him to tire. A study by Dr. Glenn Flesig -- the head researcher for the American Sports Medicine Institute, home of noted athletic orthopedist Dr. James Andrews -- determined that a pitcher's size does not dictate fatigue.
"There was no difference between the short and tall groups regarding how much load there was on the elbow related to Tommy John injury risk nor on the shoulder related to rotator cuff risk," wrote Fleisig in an e-mail. "The load stretching the front of the shoulder [related to front shoulder capsule injury risk] was actually less in the shorter group than taller group. Thus, the data does not support the theory that shorter pitchers produce greater loads [and injury risk] on their arms."
More than likely, Cueto did not arrive in spring training camp in adequate shape, despite having pitched so much during the winter. These days, Cueto is not the spindly pitcher the Reds signed in 2004. Instead, he carries a slight paunch -- the spoils of success.
It's almost impossible to relate how difficult it is for a person who comes from a poor country to handle excess when it's presented to them. But Cueto is making an effort to get in better shape.
Shortly after throwing a bullpen session this week, Cueto spent time with Reds trainers working out with a medicine ball. After they finished the exercise, Cueto ran up and down a hill near the playing fields.
"I see him working a little extra this year," said former Reds pitcher Mario Soto, a roving instruction during the spring.
Part of that extra work includes the pantomiming with Price.
"We're just trying to add some discipline, maintain a delivery and thought process throughout the course of an outing," Price said. "What we want is a consistency and reliability to his pitches. The more effort he expends the more energy that he needs, and it will affect him throughout the course of a season. Sometimes he works too hard to throw hard."
There are also other signs of maturity. Previously, Reds pitcher Edinson Volquez said Cueto often ignored autograph-seekers, but that he now happily spends time signing for fans.
After one of his workouts this week had ended, Cueto and Chapman were leaving one of the Reds' many playing fields at their spring training complex.
Cueto immediately turned toward a group of fans and began signing autographs. Chapman, who was headed toward the clubhouse, saw Cueto signing and also headed toward the fans and signed autographs.
Cueto a leader? Perhaps he has truly grown up.

TAMPA, Fla. -- The place is now called George M. Steinbrenner Field. Its former name -- Legends Field -- is decidedly more appropriate, for more than any other team in professional sports, the New York Yankees like to keep their ghosts breathing.
One by one, you see them. Reggie Jackson is sweating after a vigorous workout. He last took a swing at a major league pitch nearly 22 years ago, on Oct. 4, 1987, at old Comiskey Park -- an eighth-inning single to center off a second-year kid named Bobby Thigpen. He is drenched now because even though he'll be 63 years old on May 18, it is crucial that he maintain the legend's presence. Swagger can't be flabby.
Graig Nettles walks through, slightly hunched, a plate of food in hand. In the hallway between the clubhouse and the coaches' room, Harlan Chamberlain, dad of Joba, salutes Nettles from his motorized wheelchair. Rich Gossage, newly minted Hall of Famer, is there, too, the Fu Manchu less blond, more silvery, just as menacing. Yogi Berra, himself 84 on May 12, zooms past in a golf cart to see Mariano Rivera's first bullpen session of the spring, and girls whose parents never saw Berra play squeal, "Yogi Berra? Is that really him?"
Still, it is Jackson who remains the most relevant. In a universe where the Yankees seem to trot out another contender to his throne every December by signing a free agent who thinks he can conquer the big town as Jackson once did, Reggie is still The One, the standard of the big-money outsider who became part of the New York family simply by delivering on the promise.
Fittingly, while Jackson stands in the hallway cooling down, a white towel around his neck, Mark Teixeira strolls past.
Teixeira is the latest to try to climb the baseball equivalent of Mount Everest: playing in New York as the top-dollar free agent and coming through on the other side. Until the past couple of weeks, he had been able to blend in, a $180 million complementary player. But as collateral damage of Alex Rodriguez's injury, he blends no more. With Rodriguez -- and the bizarre, unrelenting dramas that seem to always accompany him -- gone at least until near the All-Star break, Teixeira is the power bat in the Yankees' lineup. He is the one who will have to create the murmurs in the stands at the new Stadium when it is his turn with two on and one out. He is now the one everyone in New York is waiting for.
In the wake of Rodriguez's surgery earlier this month, manager Joe Girardi said he told Teixeira and the rest of the Yankees the same thing Joe Torre once told Jason Giambi. Just be yourself. Don't make too many promises. Play your game. Teixeira stands strong, listens closely to the rhetoric about how New York can devour a guy; and his body language adopts the position that says, "Bring it on."
Seven years ago, in the spring of 2002, Giambi took the same stance, with the same unrelenting smile amid the same crushing expectations. Teixeira even wears Giambi's old number: 25. He is handsome and confident. He looks people in the eye when he speaks and he does so with clear and square-jawed enthusiasm. ("Hi. Mark Teixeira  damned glad to meet you.")
He says everything correctly: that he doesn't play for money and that others equate high salary with higher expectations far more than he does; that winning is more important than statistics; and that the tradition, and not the money, is what ultimately attracted him to New York. The boom-and-bust nature of New York titillated him.
"I always expect to put up big numbers and carry my team," he says, and he has the muscular résumé to back it up. He is 29 years old, 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, in his prime. After breaking in with Texas in 2003, he has never hit higher than .308, never lower than .281. He has played 904 games over six years in the big leagues, and his average season -- .290 average, 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, .378 on-base percentage -- suggests the kind of patient, meaty consistency the Yankees covet, the kind they thought they were getting when Giambi signed a seven-year, $120 million contract two weeks before Christmas in 2001.
Yet, as he speaks, the impulse exists to doubt that he has any idea about exactly what he's gotten himself into, that youth is indeed going to be wasted on the young.
For more than three decades now, the Yankees have featured this same old movie starring a series of different leading men; Teixeira is merely the latest. They show up, don the uniform at the news conference, and fit the cap. But none of them -- not Giambi, not Dave Winfield, and thus far not Rodriguez -- wound up with the girl, save for Reggie.
When Giambi arrived, Jackson gave him "The Talk." How to make it in New York . What to do and how to do it. How to be the biggest guy in the biggest place. All too eager to please, Giambi listened attentively.
When Rodriguez arrived in 2004 in a winter trade with Texas, he dined with Jackson in Tampa numerous times, often at Roy's, the famous Hawaiian fusion chain, where Rodriguez received many different versions of "The Talk."
Reggie says he hasn't yet had "The Talk" with Teixeira, and Teixeira seems positively sure he doesn't need it. Maybe he comes to New York with the world to gain and leaves the city bigger than when he arrived.
"A big difference isn't just what I did in '77," Jackson says one evening in Tampa. "The difference is I didn't have to come to New York to prove I could be a champion. I had already won three World Series before I ever got there. The new guys coming in, they haven't."
Winfield played great all-around baseball for the Yankees. He was the first Yankee with five straight seasons of 100 or more RBIs since Joe DiMaggio; he hit .350 in the 1981 LDS against Milwaukee; and he took them to the World Series that year, his first with the club. Reggie was there, too. The Yankees went up 2-0 in the series, but then Nettles and Jackson got hurt. New York lost four straight to the Dodgers, and the only thing anyone remembers about that Series is that Winfield went 1-for-22 and never lived it down. The Yankees didn't make the playoffs again until 1995, and didn't win another division title until 1996.
Rickey Henderson put up big numbers as a Yankee, too, but those teams never made the playoffs; and though Henderson played for both New York teams, the city never adopted him as one of its own.
Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield both performed admirably, while Giambi was well-liked and reached the World Series in his second year as a Yankee. But none of them ever met the expectations or captured the imagination of the city in the way once forecast for them.
Statistically, Rodriguez has been nothing short of spectacular as a Yankee. He is, right now, easily the greatest third baseman in the team's history. Yet the support he receives from his teammates seems, if nothing else, self-preserving; they need his production, so they need him to be happy. And they don't need the headaches that would result from true candor regarding their feelings toward him. Last week, one player, laughing in ridicule, commented this way on Rodriguez's painful photo spread in Details: "The Post ran a picture of Alex kissing himself in the mirror. He's actually kissing himself. No joke. What the [expletive] is up with that guy?"
He is in Year 6 in New York, has not reached the World Series and, despite two MVP trophies, is dangerously close to becoming a statistically brilliant sideshow.
Each new face has been expected to live up to the Reggie ideal, but each case has been a setup doomed to fail. They arrive almost on a lucrative dare, pushed by their macho and competitive instincts as well as by a union that reminds them accepting the biggest deal on the market raises the salary level for every other player. Of course, the biggest reason they come is to prove they are man enough to hack it.
And therein lies the difference: Reggie came to New York for the most authentic of reasons. Jackson craved New York, wanted it to become a part of him. He left for free agency following the 1981 season; but for the most part, he has been back ever since the day he retired. Wanting to absorb all of New York was real for him.
When Winfield left, he never really returned. Given the opportunity to enter the Hall of Fame as a Yankee, he chose the satisfaction of rejecting Steinbrenner to enter the Hall as a San Diego Padre.
Giambi couldn't wait to return to California -- he's back with the A's now. And it is still unclear if Rodriguez chose New York because it's in his bones or because it satisfies his latest narcissistic impulses.
For more than three decades and counting, only Jackson came, saw and delivered.
Maybe Teixeira will be the one who finally gives him some company. It's about time, for Reggie has been sitting at a table for one since before the kid was born.

A saying exists in baseball that the smartest person in any clubhouse is the guy with either the highest batting average or the most consecutive zeroes on his paycheck.
In other words, the superstars -- smart or dumb; black, white, Latino or Asian; old or young -- run the show. They control clubhouse thought through the intimidation of their talent. Everyone without their ability either falls in line or risks the kind of peer-pressurized alienation most of us escaped moments after graduating from high school.
Keep that in mind as you consider the New York Times report that Sammy Sosa is one of the 104 players who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in baseball's 2003 survey testing because the news should not be met with an indifferent yawn, as if Sosa is just another in a long line of Hall of Fame-caliber talent biting the dust: Alex Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez and now Sosa, all in the first half of the 2009 season alone. Instead, this news should be greeted with the kind of outrage reserved for the worst breaches of trust because you, Mr. and Mrs. Fan, have been taken for a very special kind of ride.
For years, the discussion about performance-enhancing drugs has existed within a structure that always has benefited the players. In the late 1990s, there was the argument that steroids did not exist in large measure, that players were the victims of a "witch hunt." Then, as high-profile players began to get caught using steroids and a league-administered drug policy was implemented, the new paradigm was that Player X could not be suspected because he had never failed a drug test.
By now, that con game has been exposed completely and a new argument -- let's call it the "Alex Rodriguez Defense," used by players, fans and, unfortunately, some Hall of Fame voters -- has surfaced. This one suggests that these steroid-using superstar players were merely "caught up in a culture."
This latest orthodoxy is particularly insulting, for it suggests that the steroids era appeared one day out of thin air -- blamelessly and tragically, like, say cholera -- and that the players were unfortunate victims.
The truth is quite the opposite, for it was the star players who used their power, their influence and their good standing to create a steroid culture.
It is one thing to lie, which is bad enough, but what these players have done is infinitely worse. They have lied, convinced that their good will and celebrity -- and batting averages -- would allow them just enough dispensation to get away with it, to drown out anyone not taken in by their false charms.
They knew that the fans would be more than forgiving, that the fans, in fact, would be determined soldiers against any negativity, even if that negativity happened to be the truth.
Never mind Barry Bonds' actual transgressions; some fans in San Francisco even feel vindicated by the spectacular fall of Roger Clemens and Ramirez and, now, Sosa, as if it is proof that their man was disproportionately targeted by the government, media and public.
Even as the card house collapsed, the players knew the fans were just red-blooded capitalists who would forgive lying and cheating because there was big money at stake. How many times have we all heard the old saw? "Well, what would you have done for $10 million? You would've done the same thing."
Think about the times you've been brazenly lied to, right to your face, by people who used their "integrity" to fool you. Bill Clinton said, "I never had sexual relations with that woman." Even for a relatively common transgression, a country felt betrayed, never mind how it felt being misled into a disastrous war by straight-faced untruths from his successor.
The Alex Rodriguez-Katie Couric, Roger Clemens-Mike Wallace, Sammy Sosa-Dan Patrick moments hold -- at least in the baseball universe -- the same standard of the powerful using their position to fool the public.
When this attitude was coupled with an era when powerful entities ranging from the White House to the military to the blogosphere have skillfully turned the mainstream media into the ubiquitous enemy, the players knew the strategy all too well: They used the fans' loyalty against them.
They smiled.
You fell for it.
That was all it took.
Ironically, it is the Phillies' Raul Ibanez, burned by a blogosphere that does not have to adhere to traditional journalistic standards, who now turns back to the mainstream media -- with all of their supposed "agendas" -- to defend his name.
Far from the sports page, in the book section of the Times, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Michiko Kakutani reviews two books about the roots of the nation's financial crisis that mimic the attitude of baseball players. Under the headline, "Greed, Layered on Greed, Frosted with Recklessness," Kakutani writes, "To put it another way, the crisis was, in the words of the Newsweek business columnist Daniel Gross, 'a man-made product that turned out to be immensely toxic and damaging' -- not, as so many in the 'Smart Money crowd' insisted, 'a random, once-in-a-lifetime thing that fell out of the sky.'"
The fan has been the greatest enabler of the steroids era. Face it: Had the paying customer revolted, the institutional reaction would have been decidedly different. The superstars knew the paying customers were either too forgiving of their golden heroes or too selfish to have their fun and games interrupted (or both) to hold them accountable.
But fans aren't the only suckers walking around today.
The writers did the same, and continue to do so. Some have decided to use their Hall of Fame votes in the affirmative for the game's great but disgraced players -- Sosa, Bonds, Clemens, Ramirez -- because the players were part of a larger culture.
Yet it is an argument that could not be more offensive. It fails to take into account the willful levels of deceit that allow individual choices to become a collective culture. Some in the media are equally guilty by intellectual laziness, the bait-and-switch thinking of the apologists for whom there is no way out.
The nonbelievers of the steroids era first argued that they needed proof beyond innuendo. When the proof came, they wanted it both ways, saying, "Oh, steroids are old news. Everyone knew these guys were using."
If the writers have been guilty of lazy thinking, there is, too, the intellectual dishonesty of the players, whose excuses have transitioned from the silly ("There's nothing in a bottle to help you hit a home run" -- McGwire, Bonds) to the nuanced ("I was part of a culture" -- Rodriguez). Both are a cover for a central motivation: They got to keep the money.
It is one thing to be taken, quite another to make excuses for the very people who perpetrated this fraud. And it is even worse to reward them with induction into the Hall of Fame. The players got to keep their money. Why should they be rewarded for their deceit?
Is this baseball or Wall Street? The cultural intention to defraud is the same.
Today, it is not enough for a player merely to say he never used. Albert Pujols already did so on the cover of Sports Illustrated this year. Derek Jeter constantly has protected his legacy by saying "Not everyone is on this stuff." Both might never have used, but the words of Jeter or Pujols have no more value than Sosa's empty challenge to anyone questioning his accomplishments.
The real value will come from the superstar who actually uses his celebrity for reform, the star player whose Hall of Fame plaque might actually say "was instrumental in the fight against drug use in his sport."
Imagine that.

I covered Kirby Puckett and the Twins for many years, so when Sports Illustrated ran its cover story, "The Secret Life of Kirby Puckett,'' last month, my editors asked me to write my thoughts heading into his trial for sexual assault. I refrained. For one thing, I didn't think it appropriate to deliver my opinion before the jury did. Mostly though, even after the jury found him not guilty (which is not the same thing as being found innocent), I'm still trying to sort out my feelings about the Puckett I knew and the Puckett I didn't.
What do I think of Puckett after all the stories of the past year? I'm not sure. He delivered a great amount of joy to a great number of people, the vast majority of whom he never met. He also delivered grief to his wife with his now well-publicized philandering. How do you square so much public good with the private bad?
I don't know. The fact is, I don't know what to feel about Puckett except deep concern.
His friends are worried about him, too. Always heavy (but back then, it was mostly muscle), Puckett now is obese. He also is drinking too much, which is a terrible combination for anyone but especially for Puckett given that both his parents died of heart conditions.
"I'm scared to death for him,'' Twins third base coach Al Newman said. "I'm scared because of his health and about his frame of mind. He's a baseball man and the game that gave him everything -- the game that got him out of the Chicago ghetto -- is gone from him now. The people who loved him don't love him anymore. He's on an island by himself and he's trying to figure out how to get home.''
Newman and Puckett have been good friends since they were roommates with the Twins. Newman remembers when no one in Minnesota had a better reputation than Puckett. Now, kids come up to Newman's children at school and ask, "Your dad knows Kirby Puckett -- is Kirby a bad guy or not?''
"I wouldn't wish what happened to him on anybody,'' Newman said. "He's an icon of the state of Minnesota and he's been brought to his knees. How do you recover from that?''
After glaucoma abruptly forced Puckett's retirement in 1996, the Twins made him a vice president, a job that required him to go into the office only often enough to collect his fat paycheck. The Twins paid him $500,000 a year to be Kirby Puckett, which was enough back when Minnesota had almost nothing else to market. During one stretch, the only times they could fill the stadium were when they honored Puckett in some way (after they retired his jersey one year we joked that they would retire his pants the next season).
One year they sold a season-ticket package for $99 that included a bat personally signed by Puckett. The autographed bat was the real appeal to the package -- Kirby's name literally held more value than the games the Twins played.
That's all gone. Now, the Twins have Torii Hunter in center field, another championship banner and a whole new team worth embracing. There is no need for Kirby Puckett, whose name lost its value with the first accusations last year.
The team didn't abandon him, though, even during the scandal. With his trial still pending, they offered him a six-figure salary for a job that would require him to do little more than spend some time with the players in spring training and make limited public appearances. He turned it down.
It was harder than Puckett ever admitted for him to lose his career so suddenly. I wonder if it was even harder for him to lose his status as the ambassador of all that was good about Minnesota baseball. I wonder whether that has had anything to do with his destructive behavior over the past year or so.
"Somehow, we have to figure out something for him to do,'' Newman said. "There has to be something to help him get back into the game.''
I covered Puckett on an almost daily basis as a Twins beat writer from 1989-1993 and on a fairly regular basis for several more seasons after leaving the full-time beat. I may have written his name in more stories than anyone else ever did. I once wrote that a clubhouse was always a happier place when he was inside it. I still believe that.
Just as I also now know that Puckett could also be a louse off the field.
Not that he is the only person -- in baseball or general society or the White House -- to cheat on a spouse. Should I hold him to a different standard than I did the president? Than I do other players who have not had their dirty laundry aired in public? How many accusations of violence should I believe about a man who never showed the slightest anger in my presence?
How do I feel about Kirby Puckett, a man who made me smile for so many years and now has left me shaking my head? Like a lot of people, I'm not sure. He is by no means a victim -- make no mistake, he brought this on himself. No one forced him to cheat on his wife, no one forced him to do anything.
But that doesn't mean I don't feel for him.
Because almost everyone involved was drinking (and some drinking heavily), we'll probably never know exactly what happened that night in the restaurant. All I know for certain is that Puckett needs to get some help and I hope he gets it before it's too late.
Boxscore lines of the week
Greg Maddux, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez have won a combined 12 Cy Youngs. The only seasons in the past dozen that one of the three has not won the award were 1996 and 1998. The three were a combined 60-15 with a 2.37 ERA and 691 strikeouts last season.
So what are the odds that all three would be the first three pitchers to allow 10 runs in a game -- and that they would do it during a four-day stretch?
Well, consider it this way. Pedro had never allowed that many runs in a game his entire career until last Saturday when the Orioles scored 10 against him in four innings. The day after he allowed his previous career-high -- nine runs in July, 1999 -- he went on the disabled list.
Their lines:
Maddux: 5.2 IP, 12 H, 10 R, 7 ER, 2 BB, 3 K
Johnson: 4.2 IP, 10 H, 10 R, 10 ER, 2 BB, 4 K
Martinez: 4.1 IP, 9 H, 10 R, 10 ER, 4 BB, 5 K
And if you think all that was strange, consider that in two of Maddux's first three starts, Atlanta lost by scores of 17-1 and 16-2.
Lies, damn lies and statistics
Four incidents of fans running onto the field in one game? Another fan attacking someone on the field? Does the security at Comiskey Park do anything? Not that the record is much better at Wrigley Field, where fans battled with the Los Angeles bullpen a couple seasons ago and where a fan attacked Randy Myers on the mound several years back.  ... It took Tigers manager Alan Trammell 10 games before he finally won his first, just off the record pace of 13 games by Washington's Mal Kittredge in 1904. Kittredge was 1-16 when the Senators dumped him as manager (he remained their catcher). You could bet that was a bad year for Washington. The Senators went 38-113, finished 55½ games out of first place, hit 10 home runs and drew 131,000 fans. ... Meanwhile, it took Torii Hunter until Minnesota's 11th game before he scored a run and Houston's Lance Berkman 11 games to drive in a run. ... Thirteen games into the season, the Diamondbacks are 10 games behind the Giants, have yet to get a win from Randy Johnson or Curt Schilling and now Johnson is hurt. ... A tip of the cap to Roger Kahn for canceling his scheduled appearance at Cooperstown in protest over the Hall of Fame's decision to cancel a "Bull Durham'' celebration because of anti-war statements from Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon.

Who knows? The Red Sox, not the Yankees, might have been the team dominating baseball over the past half dozen years had they not made one terrible decision with a pitcher in 1996.
Boston, not New York, might be such a perennial World Series presence that it includes "celebrating on the mound'' in spring training fundamental drills had they not made a move that should haunt them more than the words, ''Mike Torrez.''
The Fenway Faithful, not the Bronx Zoo, might be the smuggest, most insufferable fans in baseball had the Red Sox not let go of one of the best pitchers in the major leagues.
I am not talking about the free agent departure of Roger Clemens at the end of the 1996 season. I'm talking about the trade of Jamie Moyer for Darren Bragg during the 1996 season.
As Clemens nears his 300th victory, consider these comparisons. Since leaving the Red Sox as a free agent following the 1996 season, Clemens is 107-43 and has been paid $59 million. Since the Red Sox traded Moyer to the Mariners earlier that year, he is 105-50 and has been paid $31.5 million.
In other words, the Red Sox could have a pitcher with more than 100 wins over the past seven seasons and easily have enough money to have signed Pedro or anybody else to front the rotation.
You don't hear much about Moyer. He's never struck out 20 batters in a game. He's never been ejected from a postseason game in the second inning while wearing warpaint. He's never assaulted Mike Piazza with a splintered bat.
All he does is win. And win. And win. Since 1996, he has a better winning percentage than Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson or Greg Maddux. In fact, he has the best winning percentage in baseball during that span (minimum 15 decisions each season).
Granted, that doesn't make Moyer the best pitcher in baseball. But he's the best pitcher who was once released by the Texas Rangers.
No, the Red Sox weren't the only team to underestimate Moyer. The Mariners are his seventh organization since he was drafted in 1984. He once was traded for Mitch Williams. He pitched for Joe Torre -- in St. Louis.
He learned quite a bit about pitching during all those journeys and finally put it all together in 1996. He is the second big-league pitcher to go from as many as 23 games under .500 for his career to 23 games above .500.
"He's like a fine wine, he gets better with age,'' said Minnesota third base coach Al Newman, who faced him as a player more than a decade ago. "No, actually, he just gets slower.''
It's true. Moyer can pitch in the mid 80s, but he loves to make batters look ridiculous by throwing curveballs and changeups in the 70s that appear to defy gravity. He throws slop up there so tantalizingly slow that scouts can measure his pitches by counting "One Mississippi, two Mississippi.'' As one opponent said after Moyer made him look silly this year, "He was throwing feathers up there.''
Moyer is as old school as they come -- he still shows his stirrup socks -- and even without a blazing fastball he can be a mean SOB on the mound. He isn't afraid to pitch seriously inside and if a batter crosses him, he isn't afraid to leave a bruise. On several occasions, catcher Dan Wilson has heard Moyer shout at the batter and ask what pitch he would like him to throw next. "They don't know what to make of it,'' Wilson said.
He turns 41 this fall, but Moyer is in exceptional shape and is capable of pitching several more seasons. With 171 career wins, he could very well finish with more than 200. That may not be as impressive as Clemens' final total, but Boston fans wouldn't have minded if a few more of them had come in a Red Sox uniform.
Boxscore line of the week
Ken Griffey Jr. delivered one of the most welcome lines of the season when he went 4-for-4 with two home runs Saturday (coming two runs short of a perfect 4 AB, 4 R, 4 H, 4 RBI line) to lift his batting average to .300. But we still prefer Friday's line from the player who replaced him in center field in Seattle, Mike Cameron.
Torii Hunter, Minnesota's gold glove outfielder who makes his living robbing opponents of home runs, finally had it happen to him last Friday when Cameron leaped and reached waaaaaaaayyyyy over the fence to bring back a certain three-run homer in Seattle.
"The thief got robbed,'' Hunter said. "That's the first time anyone has ever done that to me. Now I know what it feels like. And it sucks.''
That wasn't the only notable web gem by Cameron. With Jacque Jones breaking from second on the ball, Cameron speared a low line drive just off the grass for the second out, then kept running in and stepped on second base to easily double-up Jones for a rare unassisted double play and this seldom seen boxscore line:
DP-Seattle (Cameron).
"I've never done that before,'' Cameron said. "I don't think anyone's ever done that before.''
Well, yes, they have. Joe McEwing was the most recent to do it, pulling off the trick April 4 of last year.
Lies, damn lies and statistics
Bob Hope turns 100 this week. The Yankees have won all but 15 of their 8,895 victories during his lifetime. Hope, by the way, was the part-owner of the Cleveland Indians in the 1950s, when his friend, Bing Crosby, was part owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. ... Career mark for Clemens since the Red Sox let the Rocket go after the 1996 season: 107-43, 3.34 ERA, 1,386 strikeouts, 1,355.2 innings, 201 starts, three Cy Young awards, two World Series championships, one triple crown, $59.2 million in salary. Career mark for Pedro Martinez since Boston signed him one year later: 91-26, 2.30, 1,102 strikeouts, 1,040.1 innings, 148 starts, two Cy Young awards, no World Series, one triple crown, $72.675 million in salary. ... How tough have the Dodgers and Cubs pitchers been? Both have more strikeouts than hits allowed (419-351 for Los Angeles and 431-365 for Chicago). The only major-league staff to finish a season with more strikeouts than hits allowed was Cleveland in 1968.  . . . Detroit's Mike Maroth has lost as many games (nine) in the first two months of the season as Pedro Martinez has lost since Sept. 20, 2000.  ... Detroit has been shut out nine times already. The record for a season is 30. ... Physics lesson: How much mass was involved when C.C. Sabathia collided with Dmitri Young in last Wednesday's Detroit-Cleveland game? ... A follow-up to readers who might have enjoyed last week's trivia question regarding the relative ages of Jack McKeon and Wilford Brimley -- Brimley is less than two years older than Robert Redford, the man who called him "Pop'' in "The Natural.''

Baseball is an expensive game, and it's especially painful for teams when they're paying millions to players who can't even play. For instance, Albert Belle is still officially on Baltimore's disabled list and being paid $12 million even though he hasn't played in three seasons while Pat Meares is still on Pittsburgh's and being paid nearly $4 million even though he hasn't played since 2001.
Compared to that, the teams with these active players who at some point this season were on the disabled list have nothing to moan about. Our All-Star All-Hurt team:
Pos., Player		Salary
 C Mike Piazza		$15.6 million
1B Mo Vaughn		$17 million
2B Craig Counsell	$2.5 million

"299 Forever''
-- sign held up by an apparent Red Sox fan when Roger Clemens failed to get his 300th win.

There was a man dressed up as a giant hot dog on the third-base line. The team mascot was a giant frog wearing swim fins. There were water balloon contests between innings.
So last Wednesday's Everett Aqua Sox game was a long way from Bob Davidson's days as a major-league umpire. But at least this was a major step up from where Bob was recently. After all, this was the Class A Northwest League, a real professional baseball league with major-league affiliates. Prior to the Northwest League gig, Davidson was umping slo-pitch softball games for $20 a pop, the first time he had to tell players to keep the beer cans off the field since working one of David Wells' starts. Sure, $20 doesn't sound like much but he could knock off three games in an evening and make $60.
Which is about what he earned Wednesday.
Compare that to the $160,000 annual salary Davidson earned as an 18-year veteran major-league umpire -- he worked the 1992 World Series and was behind the plate for Kevin Brown's no-hitter in 1997 -- before he committed career suicide by following his union leader off a cliff in 1999. "This was a mistake that money-wise, pretty much cost us everything,'' Davidson said.
In a strategy that Davidson now admits was "asinine,'' Richie Phillips had his union members submit their resignations that summer, figuring that the move would force major-league executives to meet their demands. Instead, baseball gladly accepted the resignations and hired less expensive replacements.
Many umpires withdrew their resignations and got their jobs back. Davidson didn't. He took the field the day before his resignation took effect knowing that it might be his last game for a while and he was right. He just didn't know "a while'' would last as long as the Yankees dynasty.
"I remember everything about that game,'' he said. "I wore my mask between innings so people wouldn't see me crying.''
Through arbitration and lawsuits, all but nine umpires eventually got their jobs back or agreed to retirement settlements. Davidson is one of the nine, and though they still have a lawsuit pending, he's essentially given up waiting for a court remedy. He needs to pay his bills and there aren't a lot of companies hiring 50-year-old former umpires.
"I made a mistake and it cost me my job,'' he said. "I could sit here and feel sorry for myself. But the way I look at it is I've got a second chance and I'm going to take it. I've gotten past the point where I beat myself up. And I did beat myself up for a couple years. I was very angry, very resentful, very mad. But I'm over that now.''
So he decided to work his way back to the majors the same way he got there two decades ago. Through the minors, beginning here in Everett, Boise, Bellingham and the rest of the Northwest League cities.
If Davidson does well, he'll move up to a full season Class A league next year. Then to Double-A and Triple-A. He says if all goes well, he could be back in the majors by 2008 when he is 55.
"I'm willing to do that,'' he said. "I just don't want my career to end because I threw it away.''


Davidson qualified as a minor-league umpire this spring and threw his luggage into a car with 21-year-old umpire Scott Jarrod, who was born the year Davidson first reached the majors. The two drove 20 hours to Everett to begin the Northwest League season, where Davidson will earn $1,800 a month with a $20 per diem. He and Jarrod will share a car and a room the entire summer.
"I wanted to see a different side of things,'' Jarrod said of rooming with a man old enough to be his father. "Nobody my age can tell me a lot more about umpiring that I already know while Bob can tell me more about umpiring than I probably should know.''
There were several reporters and an ESPN TV crew following Davidson when he umpired his first game last week and he was in good spirits, happy to be back on the field. But the difficult part will be in a month when no TV cameras are focused on him, when no reporters are calling him and when it seems as if no one cares about him outside his immediate family. Those seven-hour road trips from Boise to Everett are going to get very long and very tiring, very quickly.
Baseball gleefully accepted his resignation years ago. It has gone to court rather than hire him back. So what makes Davidson think the league will ask him back when he's even older in a couple years just because he worked his way up through the minors?
That answer is simple. He has no other choice but to hope.
"A darkhorse? I'm a three-legged horse,'' he said. "I know that it may not happen. There are no promises, no guarantees. But I know that if given a fair shake -- and I know baseball will give me a fair shake -- then I can do it.''
Davidson's quest may be quixotic and it would seem sad if it wasn't so admirable.
He's an umpire. This is what he does for a living.
"I've learned one thing,'' Davidson said. "I need baseball a whole lot more than it needs me.''
Boxscore line of the week
It was a big week for Roger Clemens last week. He won his 300th career game two Fridays ago. Then he appeared on the David Letterman show and read off his Top 10 list of things he learned in the major leagues, including, "No. 8, There's not a damn thing to do in Milwaukee,'' and "No. 6, You can melt an umpire's gruff exterior with a simple hug,'' and "No. 4, Best practical joke? Tell a teammate he's been traded to the Devil Rays,'' and "No. 1, Adjusting your cup doesn't do anything; just makes you feel good.''
Apparently, the crack about the Devil Rays irritated Tampa Bay owner Vince Naimoli, who has a lousy sense of humor in addition to a lousy ballclub. Lighten up, Vince. If you don't want to be the league's official punchline, try winning some games.
As if to punctuate the joke, Clemens pitched against Tampa Bay on Wednesday and nearly filled in the only thing missing from his resume. Clemens held the Devil Rays hitless before Marlon Anderson singled with one out in the eighth inning. The Rocket's line:
8 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 9 K
Had Clemens been able to complete the no-no, he would have joined Cy Young, Walter Johnson and Nolan Ryan as the only pitchers to throw a no-hitter after winning their 300th game.
Of course, ol' Cy is the sole resident of a much more exclusive club: the only pitcher of the modern era to throw a no-hitter after his 400th victory.
Lies, damn lies and statistics
Detroit entered Tuesday with an 18-55 record and a .247 winning percentage, making the Tigers just the second team since the 1962 Mets to be on pace to match the Amazin's record for losses in a season (120) after the first official day of summer (June 21). The 1982 Twins were 18-56 (a .243 winning percentage) on June 28 before winning nine of their next 11 games. ... How bad are the Tigers? Cleveland has won almost as many games in Detroit (five) as the Tigers have (six). Detroit also has three pitchers with at least 10 losses -- Jeremy Bonderman (2-11), Mike Maroth (2-11) and Adam Bernero (1-10). ... In between John Smoltz's losses (May 30, 2002-June 18, 2003), Glendon Rusch lost 22 games. ... The Mariners played their first Monday game since April 14 last week and the only one on their original schedule from mid-April to late July. It's a rare scheduling quirk and one the team thinks has helped it keep the same five starting pitchers all season. "At first I wasn't real happy about it but my body has gotten used to it and taken a liking to it,'' Jamie Moyer said. "If there's anybody it's helped, it's Gil Meche (who is back in the majors after missing almost three years with arm injuries). ... Sammy Sosa missed seven games for corking his bat and it was nice so many Cubs fans welcomed him back with a big ovation (amid some booing). But if the Cubs miss the postseason by one or two games, will they feel as happy about his absence during a 3-4 streak in which Chicago lost two games by a run? ... And compare Sosa's suspension to Edgar Martinez's unofficial suspension. Thanks to interleague play in National League stadiums, Gar missed four games and was limited to five pinch-hit appearances in the others. Due to that layoff and a slump, he has just six hits and two RBI since June 2, but the Mariners are 12-7 during that span. ... I know Jose Canseco violated his probation yet again and needs to finally learn a lesson, but doesn't facing 15 years for taking steroids seem a trifle extreme? I mean, it's not like he killed anything other than his own career. ... A sad farewell to Leonard Koppett, who died over the weekend at age 79. Koppett was one of the first baseball writers to take an analytical, unconventional and usually right on view of statistics, and he kept on doing so right up until his death. He'll be missed. ... The same is just as true of Larry Doby, who deserved far more credit than he ever received. He had just as many lonely nights and difficulties as Jackie Robinson did and he should have been in the Hall of Fame much earlier than his 1998 induction.

The Hut is a popular live music/tiki bar in Tucson near the University of Arizona campus. You enter the bar by walking under a 45-foot-high tiki head that formerly reigned over a local miniature golf course. The bar's interior is a former metal fabrication plant where workers made bomb casings in World War II, a heritage The Hut honors with its signature cocktail. Named after the first atomic bomb, the Fat Man is a 60-ounce drink served in a fishbowl and swimming in the maximum alcohol amount allowed by Arizona law.
There was a three-day music festival at The Hut this past weekend, but as soon as one band finished its set Friday night, the bar turned down the music and turned up the Mariners' home opener from Seattle. Bar regulars and employees turned their focus from their Fat Men and beers to focus on the TV screens as Seattle reliever Tom Wilhelmsen took the mound to face the Cleveland Indians lineup. The season is one week old, Seattle is about 1,600 miles away, the Mariners are trailing 6-0 and Wilhelmsen is in the process of making it 11-0, but the bar crowd is going crazy, spirits rising and falling with his every pitch.
"It was like we were watching a University of Arizona basketball game," says Scott Mencke, a co-partner of The Hut. "The people here were overreacting to everything. If Tom threw a strike, people cheered like crazy. When he gave up the home run, people were bent over double." And when Wilhelmsen ended the 10-run inning by striking out Austin Kearns? "It was like Miles Simon just hit the game winner in the NCAA championship [in 1997]. We were all giving high-fives.
"We had people from out of town who came for the music, and they're probably  wondering, 'What are these Tucsonians doing, going nuts over this Mariners game?'"
Well, that's easy to explain. These people were simply excited to see a friend and fellow bartender who had mixed Fat Men and poured beer at The Hut as recently as December take another step in baseball's most delightfully unlikely comeback story that doesn't include Dennis Quaid as a high school science teacher/baseball coach.
One month after bicycling to daily spring training workouts, one year after pitching in Class A, two years after playing center field in a co-rec softball league, five years after backpacking around Europe and seven years after leaving organized baseball for a career mixing Fat Men, Wilhelmsen was pitching in the major leagues.
"It's a little different from the beer league we were playing softball in," says Wilhelmsen, who grew up in Tucson. "I ultimately knew this day would come, but I didn't realize it would come this quick. But it's a great feeling."
A great feeling? This story leaves you feeling better than a free round of Fat Men.
"You can just say it's a miracle," Seattle third baseman Chone Figgins says. "It's one of those miracle situations."
Wilhelmsen, 27, is a tall, broad-shouldered young man who is quick to flash a smile bright enough to power U2's entire 360° tour. He is animated and engaging and said to have a very impressive collection of tie-dyed shirts. "Holy [Fill in the blank]" is a favorite expression, with the "Holy" drawn out and stressed. Hole-Ley.


“
I was very disappointed for years. People would say, 'He'll be back, he'll be back.' I would be like, 'I don't know. You have to want it.' After about three years I would tell people, 'No, he's never coming back.'
”

"I'm not exaggerating at all: He is the nicest guy you'll meet in your life," Mencke says. "He's beyond nice. He cares about people; he's empathetic to people. He's fair, he's honest, but he's also a personality."
"He is the salt of the earth," says Douglas "Fini" Finical, The Hut's other operating partner. "What you see is what you get. He's a gregarious guy, very open.  There's sort of a displaced hippie in him. He loves the Grateful Dead. I see him as a guy who would be just as happy living in 1968. One of those people who is completely genuine. Just completely original and genuine."
And once upon a time, Wilhelmsen also was a promising, hard-throwing right-hander in the Milwaukee Brewers system. A seventh-round pick in the 2003 draft, he went 5-5 with a 2.76 ERA at Class A Beloit in 2003. But he also was a free spirit who twice tested positive for marijuana. The Brewers responded to the second test by suspending him for the 2004 season.
The next year Wilhelmsen effectively suspended himself by giving up his baseball career to travel and hike our national parks. He says he was burned out on baseball and no longer had the passion for the game he once did.
"My first immediate thought was to pull a Mutt Mantle and go wring this kid by his neck and go take him home. That lasted about 30 minutes," says his father and former coach, John Wilhelmsen. "Then it was: 'You know, it's his life.' No matter what your kids do, you're going to love them no matter what. What does the other stuff mean? I knew he wasn't into it anymore because he didn't do anything in the offseason. He would usually work out or ask me to throw with him.
"I was very disappointed for years. People would say, 'He'll be back, he'll be back.' I would be like, 'I don't know. You have to want it.' After about three years I would tell people, 'No, he's never coming back."'
Wilhelmsen's agent, Steve Canter, says Tom needed some distance. "Some people go to college to grow up; Tom went and worked and traveled and started to get his life together. He got his own education."
He certainly did.
After hiking numerous parks, Wilhelmsen returned to Tucson, where he applied for a bartending job at The Hut. "We were looking at the application and looking at his job history, and there was only one entry," Mencke says. "For the company, he put down: 'Milwaukee Brewers.' Position: 'Pitcher.'" Mencke laughs. "We were looking for good-looking females to hire, but Tom walked into the bar and filled out an application, and after talking to him, I decided right then, this is a good guy to have around. I just had a gut feeling about him."
Wilhelmsen also reconnected with his old high school girlfriend Cassie, and they hiked extensively through the Southwest and the West. They backpacked through Europe in 2006, running the hostel gamut from Amsterdam through Bavaria into Italy and then back up through France and England.
While some of his former teammates were just reaching baseball's major league green cathedrals, Wilhelmsen was touring Notre Dame. When he could have been pitching in Milwaukee while beer-drinking fans sang the "Beer Barrel Polka," he was listening to Germans sing at Munich's Oktoberfest. ("We heard 'Country Roads' every 15 minutes. And that song, 'Heyyyy, baby.   Oooh! Aahhh!' every 15 minutes.") And rather than studying video of Albert Pujols, he was gazing in awe at Michelangelo's David. ("It's a statue of a guy, and you think, Oh. Great. But you stand in that line and then you walk in and see it, and you say, 'Hole-ley cow!'")
Back in Tucson, he and Cassie played on a co-rec softball team. Cassie played second; Tom played in the outfield. "I was too afraid to pitch -- it was so close to home plate. So I told my brother who is blind in one eye to do it," Wilhelmsen says and laughs. "He's still in a league, and he still pitches. He calls me up when he strikes out three or gives up 12 runs."
They were fun times, of which Wilhelmsen says, "There was a lot going on," before reconsidering for a moment and adding with a smile, "Really not a lot going on."
Which was pretty much the problem. His was not a bad life when you're in your 20s, but not so much when you grow older and staying up until 4 a.m. isn't quite so much fun as it was and guys you played with in the minors are set for life after earning millions in the majors, then you look down at your arm and wonder what might have been if only you had given baseball your all.
"Cassie was a huge part of it. I started thinking about the future because I wanted to ask her to be my wife," Wilhelmsen says. "That was the big part. What am I going to do? I don't want to come home at four in the morning to her, especially if we're going to have kids. I don't want to smell like beer all the time."
He also was smoking a pack or so of cigarettes a day, but one June day in 2008, he says, "I went outside, lit a cigarette, smoked it about three-quarters down and said, 'What the hell am I doing?' Then I threw the cigarette out, and that was it."
Just like that, Wilhelmsen quit smoking. Then he celebrated Father's Day by calling up his father and repeating a question from "Field of Dreams" that has accounted for an estimated 43 percent of all American male tears shed since 1989. "Hey Dad, you want to play catch?"
When Wilhelmsen's story is turned into a movie, this is where the music will swell and you will see a montage of Wilhelmsen (John Krasinski from "The Office"?) running laps and sprints and agility drills to work himself back into shape. There will be lots of shots of his pitches popping into his father's catcher's glove. Tom mixing Fat Men behind the bar and curveballs on the mound. The montage will make it look easier than it probably was, but the return was quick. By 2009, Wilhelmsen was ready to pitch again. Shortly after marrying Cassie, he tried out and signed a contract with the Tucson Toros of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league so minor that its salaries were about $900 a month, the per diem was $10 and a player with one club once had to drive the team van from Arizona to British Columbia for the next game.
Wilhelmsen was just rounding back into form with the Toros when he suffered a biceps injury that ended his season. He received some workers' compensation and returned to The Hut.
While the arm healed, his agent called up Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik, who had been Milwaukee's scouting director when Wilhelmsen was with the Brewers. Canter told Zduriencik that Wilhelmsen was pitching again and asked whether the Mariners would take a look at him. When Zduriencik did, he was impressed enough to offer Wilhelmsen a minor league contract in February 2010.
"He's a little more mature now," Zduriencik says. "He has a better focus of what he wants to do. Now he wants to play baseball, and I think he'll tell you he lost that desire somewhere along the way. And now he's a grown man with a wife, and he has responsibilities. He's experienced some things in life. He's fortunate that he still has a live arm. That doesn't happen every day where a guy moves on with his life and is able to come back five years later and pitch at this level."
Says Wilhelmsen, "I'm just older now, and I have more responsibility and understand what it is to have responsibilities. Maybe not to the fullest extent, but a hell of a lot more than I did when I was younger. I just have more life experience in general and understand how to go about your life."
Wilhelmsen pitched well enough last year for the Mariners' Arizona League team and their Class A teams in Everett, Wash., and Clinton, Iowa, to earn a spot on the 40-man roster and an invitation to spring training this year. He was so thrilled by it all that he occasionally was seen asking teammates and coaches for autographs this spring. Given little chance to make the team out of Arizona, he just kept pitching and getting better. And when the Mariners announced their final roster, he was on the team. He quickly called his father.
"I could hear that he was crying; he was very emotional about it," his father says. "He kept saying, 'Thank you, Dad.' He just made me all warm and fuzzy."
Wilhelmsen made his major league debut in Oakland, striking out one batter in a scoreless inning. His next appearance was Friday's home opener after he added to the dreamlike nature of his comeback by running onto the field with his teammates through a fog machine while 48,000 fans cheered.
With his wife and his father watching from the stands and dozens of friends watching on TV at The Hut, Wilhelmsen entered that night's game in the fourth inning with Seattle trailing 6-0, one out and one runner on. He gave up a single, struck out a batter, walked a batter, gave up a two-run single and then gave up a towering home run to Travis Hafner that banged off the window of the seldom-reached Hit It Here Café in the right-field upper deck.
"That was in his butter," Wilhelmsen says of the gopher ball. "If it was any other place, he probably would have hit it within this zip code. But right there? It was gone. I looked at it and I was just like, 'Hole-ley, bomb!' And I watched it the whole way, and I usually never, ever do that. But I watched that one the whole way. But now I know where his sweet spot is. He won't see another one there if I face him again."
Wilhelmsen's fastball approaches 95 mph, and in four appearances through Thursday, he has struck out six batters in 4 2/3 innings (good). But he also has walked five batters, given up eight hits and allowed six runs (not so good). After missing so many years and returning in so swift and breathtaking a leap, he needs experience in addition to the lively arm.
Mariners pitching coach Carl Willis likens Wilhelmsen's path to the majors to the way a lot of athletes wind up getting their college degree after they leave school for a pro career.
"I went to college to play baseball, and all I was concerned about was to maintain a C average to stay eligible," Willis says. "Then I signed to play pro ball and went off and started my baseball career. And then years later I said, 'I want to go back and finish college.' So when I went back, I made all A's. If there was a 10-page paper assigned, I wrote 15. Because I wanted to do it. And I think when he started as a young man, maybe he wasn't 100 percent sure baseball is what he wanted to do. Now, he's experienced different facets of life and says, 'This is what I want to do.' And he's able to be all in, 100 percent. And because he's experienced the other side of life, he appreciates this opportunity so much more to be able to go out and play the game."
Wilhelmsen says his odd path to the majors has affected him in ways he probably doesn't realize yet.
"It has helped me be a little more grounded. It helps me understand there are other things in this world than baseball," he says. "You're playing baseball and this is your dream as a kid and you play it nonstop. You live it, breathe it, you eat it. There are other things, but that's your focus if you want to get to the highest level. But there's a bigger picture. I'm very glad I was able to live a normal life away from baseball and then come back to it. If I had made it when I was playing ball, I definitely wouldn't be the same guy."
Perhaps. But in many ways, Wilhelmsen still is the same bright, optimistic, genuine personality whom people say he always has been. Consider the rookie backpack.
As is the veteran relievers' custom for embarrassing a rookie, Wilhelmsen received a child's backpack to carry to the bullpen. This is very fitting for a man who backpacked his way through Europe and back into baseball. Plus, it has the bonus of not being one of those pink My Little Pony backpacks past rookies have carried. This one is of R2D2, which Wilhelmsen finds very cool.
"I feel pretty honored by it," he says, flashing that engaging grin. "R2 is the most famous Droid in the world. And he's got my back."

Before there was Joe Mauer, before there was Kirby Puckett, there was Harmon Killebrew, a quiet but powerful block of a man who led the Upper Midwest in annual goosebump production by slamming home runs as far as the eye can see -- and you can see a long way in Minnesota.
"When Harmon and the Twins moved to Minnesota in 1961, I was 5 years old. When they went to the World Series in 1965, I was 9 and more aware,'' St. Paul native Paul Molitor said. "I got to go to one game a year on my birthday and I collected all the Coca-Cola player bottle caps. I loved all the Twins but Harmon was the guy. He was the guy I pretended to be when I played baseball in the backyard and No. 3 was the number I wanted to wear when I played Little League.
"Not many people are able to have the chance to be friends with their boyhood hero but I was lucky. And I couldn't have picked a better man. The fact that Harmon played baseball -- it's like the cliche about the Hall of Fame: That he was a Hall of Fame player is way down on the list of what made him special. He was one of the most unassuming, humble men. He was a great ambassador for the Twins and a great ambassador for baseball.
"And that's why, for a lot of people, this has been a tough time.''
Killebrew passed away Tuesday morning at the age of 74 after a battle with esophageal cancer. The Hall of Fame slugger who hit 573 career home runs (11th all-time) had been fighting the disease since December. After all treatment failed, he decided to enter hospice care to surround himself with family and friends.
According to one famous story, when Killebrew was a boy growing up in Payette, Idaho, he and his brother were playing baseball with their father in the yard when Harmon's mother yelled to complain that they were ruining the grass. "We're not raising grass,'' his father yelled back, "we're raising boys.''
However much grass was ruined, it was for a good cause. The Washington Senators signed Killebrew to a $30,000 contract after he graduated from high school in 1954. Under the existing bonus baby rules, the Senators were required to keep him on the major league roster for two years. Killebrew spent two seasons on the bench (batting only 93 times) before getting needed experience in the minors in 1956-58. He returned to the majors in 1959. That was his first real season in the majors and he led the league in home runs (42). He led the league another five times over the following 11 seasons. In the 12-season span from 1959-70, Killebrew averaged 40 homers -- back in the days when 40 home runs were a lot.
Although Carl Yastrzemski famously won the Triple Crown in 1967, he and Killebrew tied for the league lead in home runs that season with 44.
When the Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961, Killebrew instantly became the face of the Twins and was easily their most popular player. An 11-time All-Star, he finished in the top four of MVP voting five times, winning the award in 1969. That season, he hit 49 home runs with 140 RBIs (still Twins records), and scored 106 runs, walked 145 times and had a .427 on-base percentage in leading the Twins to the division title. Minnesota was swept in the ALCS when the Orioles walked Killebrew six times in the three-game series.
Former Twins catcher Earl Battey once said that the team without Killebrew was "like dressing up for a formal affair with a white tie and tails and then wearing muddy shoes.''
But eventually the Twins did put on those muddy shoes. The last season Killebrew hit 40 home runs was 1970. By 1974, his numbers were down to .222 with 13 home runs, and the Twins released him. He signed with the Royals, hitting .199 with 14 home runs before retiring.

His nickname was Killer, but that was simply a play off his last name and as much of a misnomer as calling a bald guy "Curly.'' Killebrew was one of the nicest, gentlest men you could ever meet in baseball.

His 573 career home runs are more than Mickey Mantle hit and more than all but four players had hit at that point (only Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Frank Robinson had more). Killebrew's stroke was so powerful that many -- including Harmon -- believed it was the basis for major league baseball's logo, though the designer said that isn't the case.
Killebrew's nickname was "Killer," but that was simply a play off his last name and as much of a misnomer as calling a bald guy "Curly.'' He was one of the nicest, gentlest men you could ever meet in baseball.
"There are so many Harmon Killebrew stories that are all positive. There was not a negative with Harmon. There can't be. Can't be,'' Bert Blyleven, his former teammate, said. "That's what I'll miss most about Harmon. Not his playing but his personality and the way he treated people.''
Former Twins media relations director Tom Mee said Killebrew treated everyone "as if they were his next-door neighbors.'' Blyleven agreed: "If you came over for milk, he would give you milk. He would give you coffee. Whatever you need. Harmon was that type of guy.''
"He didn't differentiate how he treated other people based on their status or social standing,'' Molitor said. "Whether you were an 18-year-old minor leaguer or a clubhouse worker, you got the same Harmon. And that was a pretty good Harmon to get.''
"I didn't have evil intentions but I guess I did have power,'' Killebrew once said.
Boy, did he ever. And what was most impressive about his power is that it came from such a compact body (in "Ball Four,''Jim Bouton refers to him as "the Fat Kid''). While he had massive upper body strength -- in perhaps his most extraordinary show of power, he was able to extract a $125,000 salary from Twins owner Calvin Griffith -- Killebrew was short by today's standards. He was charitably listed as 6-foot on his Baseball Reference page. Seeing him later in his life when he was shorter than that, it was astounding that he had been capable of so many tape-measure home runs -- his longest was estimated at 520 feet.
"I have that same feeling when I see guys like him or Hank Aaron compared to the sluggers we have today,'' Molitor said. "McGwire, Sosa, Bonds. Whatever your feelings about them, there is just a totally different physicality. And it adds to the lore of Harmon as a hitter. He was known for his towering home runs -- it seemed like he didn't hit many low line drives -- and he hit them so high and far the ball looked more like a Titleist than a Rawlings.''
"He was a lumberjack type of a player,'' Blyleven said. "He was 5-11 but he was burly chested  just naturally strong. He had that short, compact swing and when he hit the ball, it just jumped off the bat.''
Killebrew's bat thundered but he was about as loud and ostentatious as an acre of corn growing on Minnesota farmland. Paul Dickson's "Baseball's Greatest Quotations'' is a 524-page collection of quotes about and related to baseball. Reggie Jackson has five pages of quotes. Mickey Mantle has six pages of quotes. Even Henry Kissinger, Groucho Marx and The Chicken are quoted. There is not a single quote by or about Killebrew. He hit 573 home runs, won an MVP, took the Twins to their first World Series and is in the Hall of Fame, but he apparently never said anything memorable enough for the book.
"It's because he didn't say anything controversial,'' Mee said. "He would give a direct answer but not necessarily the one the writer was looking for. He didn't belittle any pitcher. He didn't belittle any fielder or management. He just gave a direct, fair answer."
Indeed. Asked by a Sports Illustrated writer in 1963 whether he had any unusual hobbies, Killebrew replied, "Just washing the dishes, I guess.''
That personality fit in superbly in Minnesota, where fans don't much care for people who call attention to themselves. And despite that final season with Kansas City and coaching jobs with other teams, Killebrew will always be associated with the Twins, who retired his No. 3. He was a broadcaster for the team for several years and frequently appeared at spring training to provide instruction to Minnesota players.
"He epitomized the history of the Minnesota Twins,'' manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Harmon and Tony Oliva. He's a Hall of Famer and one of the kindest people you could ever meet in your life. And we want our players to emulate him. There aren't too many people who met Harmon and walked away disappointed. He means everything to the organization.''
The Twins have been hanging his No. 3 jersey in their dugout ever since he announced he was entering hospice care and entering the final days of life.
You can still see the fold-down seat where Killebrew's longest home run landed an estimated 520 feet from home plate some 44 years ago. Take the Killebrew Drive exit to the Mall of America, built on the original site of old Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington. Park your car, enter the mall, go inside to the amusement park at the center, look up three stories to the southeast wall and you'll see the seat attached above the Paul Bunyan Log Chute ride. It's an appropriate spot. Harmon Killebrew, Paul Bunyan  both strong men who produced prodigious feats while swinging a hunk of wood. Bunyan chopped down entire forests. Killebrew chopped down opposing pitchers, hitting home runs and bringing Minnesotans to their feet applauding with joy.

When Sean Burroughs was 12 years old, he not only threw two no-hitters while leading his Long Beach (Calif.) team to the Little League World Series championship, he also appeared on the David Letterman Show and had the wit to tell Dave and several million viewers that when he grew up, he wanted to be a gynecologist.
When Burroughs was 17, he was a first-round draft pick. When he was 20, he represented his country at the Olympics and wore a gold medal around his neck.
When Burroughs was 21, he was in the major leagues with Sports Illustrated touting him as the year's "can't miss'' prospect. "Life is about experiencing everything you can,'' he told the magazine. "I don't know how my baseball career will go, but I know I want my life to be an adventure.''
And by the time Burroughs was 29, he was out of baseball, checking in and out of the cheapest motels he could find, wandering the streets of Las Vegas at all hours and abusing every substance he could ingest. He says he was living a "Leaving Las Vegas'' existence, a reference to the Oscar-winning and thoroughly depressing Nicolas Cage movie about a man who commits lengthy suicide via alcohol abuse. There was no Academy Award for this lifestyle, though. Burroughs says he was so desperate and paranoid that if you picked a couple particularly bad days in 2010, you could find this Little League hero, this Olympic gold medalist, this former big leaguer  eating cheeseburgers out of garbage cans. Yes, garbage cans.
Life certainly had been an experience.
Fortunately, that is not the amazing part of the Sean Burroughs story. No, the amazing and happy part of the story is that at age 30, Burroughs has put the wheels back on his life, returned to sobriety and is back in baseball, including a month in the majors.
"Last May, June, I kind of was getting things back together and thinking, 'I'd love to play baseball again,' but it was in the back of my mind because I didn't know how to do it,'' Burroughs said. "I knew it would be a long journey, but it shows when I put my mind to something and want it and persevere, it's possible. It really is. It's incredible I'm where I'm at. People are lucky to even have me alive, forget to see me play baseball and smiling every day. My worst day now is better than my best day then.''
Burroughs said this recently in the Arizona Diamondbacks' clubhouse, one month into a big league callup. The Diamondbacks sent him to Triple-A Reno a few days later but given the journey he had made, few people could ever be so satisfied playing in the minor leagues.
"It's been an incredible journey. It really has,'' Burroughs said. "It was just a year ago I was eating cheeseburgers out of garbage cans and living in Motel 6. I'd be shuffling around from hotel to hotel. On the streets until 4 in the morning. These were rat motels, we called them, ones that weren't very nice. That was a year ago -- then fast forward and I've got everything back together.''
When he was younger, Burroughs indeed had everything together. Son of 1974 American League MVP Jeff Burroughs, he was the most famous Little Leaguer this side of Kelly Leak. With his dad coaching, his Long Beach team won the Little League World Series in 1993 (and also was awarded the 1992 title after a forfeit by a team from the Philippines).
Unlike many Little League stars, Burroughs continued to excel at the game. He was the San Diego Padres' first-round pick in 1998, a gold medalist at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and in the majors in 2002. Baseball America named him the fourth-best prospect in the game that year. Burroughs hit .286 with seven home runs his first full season in the majors (2003) and Arizona general manager Kevin Towers, who was the general manager in San Diego at the time, says he remembers talk that Burroughs "was the next Tony Gwynn.''
Well, maybe not.
Burroughs had a sweet stroke and good eye at the plate, but he never developed the power desired in a third baseman. By 2005, he was back in the minors. The Padres traded him to Tampa Bay before the 2006 season, but the Rays released him that August. The Mariners signed him the following winter and assigned him to Triple-A Tacoma. He played exactly four games there in 2007, then walked away from the sport that had been a huge part of his family's life for two generations.
"I just didn't have the drive or the passion,'' Burroughs said. "I was spent physically and spent mentally. It just wasn't there. I was emotionally drained. I still loved the game and respected the game, but I didn't have the drive to go to the park every day. I kind of lost the desire.''
Far worse, Burroughs had developed a deep craving to over-indulge after games. "I was hanging out with some bad people and had done some bad things," Burroughs said. "That was more important my last couple years playing ball, and the last few years.
"I was doing a lot of things that were morally not correct and physically not correct. I was knocking at death's door. I was flirting with going to jail and getting locked up someplace. It was scary. Some people kind of came to my rescue. It was pure insanity, but I got myself back together and I'm coming back out of the haze I was in for so many years.''
Asked what his substance of choice was, Burroughs replied, "A lot. Everything. I really haven't talked too much about what it was, but it was stuff that definitely wasn't healthy taking for a long, long time, that's for sure. I was kind of like a garbage can. Whatever I had or needed, I would find and take it.  I wasn't an out-on-the-town type of guy. I would just try to fill myself with as much substances as I could, legally or illegally.''
He says his binges were an everyday thing. "I didn't have any brushes with the law or anything, fortunately," Burroughs said. "But it was inevitable. It was going to happen. It was just, 'Not yet.'''
Burroughs moved to Las Vegas and into a house that was party central. Each year he partied more. He missed a Christmas with his family, as well as weddings. He didn't return phone calls for months.
His mother, Debbie, says she and Jeff knew it was getting bad when Sean's friends told them they were worrying he was out of control. "That was the big tipoff because they were the ones partying with him," Debbie said.  "It was terrible. We were terribly worried. Baseball is important, but I just want my children to be happy and healthy. As a mother, you're only as happy as your saddest child.''


“
It's been an incredible journey. It really has. It was just a year ago I was eating cheeseburgers out of garbage cans and living in Motel 6.
”

Burroughs' agent, Joel Wolfe, says Sean would call once a year or so, threatening a comeback, but it never materialized. "I would be more in contact with his parents," Wolfe said. "That was more on the personal side, just trying to find him or see what we could do, if there was anything we could do to fish him out of Vegas. But he was just totally non-responsive. Every once in a while he would pop up. The closest I got to seeing him was the year the winter meetings were in Vegas. We traded some voice mails and texts about getting together but he never showed. 
"We were all very worried. At some point, though, it becomes exhausting. How many times can you call a guy or text a guy and he doesn't call you back, before you give up?''
Burroughs says he is always one to argue, so when friends expressed concern, he would tell them he didn't know what they were talking about, that he was fine. But "fine," he says, was not even close to accurate. "I always wanted to put the blame on somebody else. I never was man enough to step up and put it on myself and say, 'You guys are probably right.' But after a while I thought, 'Why is everyone saying this? They might have a point.'''
One thing that helped turn Burroughs around was the day he looked in the mirror and didn't recognize his face -- or his body. "I didn't pick up a weight or walk into a gym for 2½ years," Burroughs said. "It was just one of those crazy kind of diets where I was drinking eight Slurpees a day and eating an In-N-Out burger whenever I could. I weighed 260 pounds or whatever [he weighs about 220 now]. I was out of shape with big, black bags under my eyes. Bad hair, hadn't shaved for weeks on end. Hadn't taken vitamins. Hadn't eaten anything other than french fries and Slurpees.
"It was that 'Leaving Las Vegas' scenario. Motel hopping. I was living in all these motels because I was scared to stay in my house. I was paranoid of people following me. It was totally crazy, insanity. The guy I was then was paranoid and out of synch with reality.''
Wolfe wonders whether the major league life just came too quickly for Sean to handle, that success had always come too easily until it suddenly did not. "As soon as he had to deal with repetitive failure, the wheels started to come off," Wolfe said.
Burroughs says the expectations placed on him had nothing to do with his life spiraling out of control, but Towers wonders whether they might have. "You have to think about it,'' Towers said. "He was a Little League hero. His dad was an All-Star. The Olympics. There were a lot of things and so there were huge expectations. Maybe alcohol and other things became something to alleviate that pressure that was on his shoulders.''
Eventually, Burroughs decided he had had enough and it was time to turn around his life. He left Las Vegas on two feet and moved back into his parents' house, back into his old bedroom, the one with the surf stickers on the door and the Little League photos on the walls. He received a curfew, a budget and love.
"I had to break down and become a kid again,'' he said. "But it was what I needed. I needed to, well, not be locked up, but be under the care and supervision of friends and family and be responsible for my actions. Left to my own devices, I'm a different type of guy.''
As he straightened out his life, Burroughs helped his mother teach first grade in Long Beach, using the Spanish he learned in baseball to help in a classroom where that was the first language for many of the students. Debbie says Sean is a natural teacher, and having him home was just like the old days again. "He and Jeff talked baseball every day.''
"My life in baseball started coming back,'' Sean said. "I started to read the newspaper again. I hadn't read the sports page or gone on the Internet for years. I started to pick that up again to see what was happening. I started working out. Playing baseball again was in the back of my mind, but I knew it was going to be tough.
"I didn't know how I was going to do it so I just kept it simple. I got myself back in baseball shape. I called my agent and had him set up some tryouts. I was just hoping for an invitation anywhere, be it an independent league or what. I just wanted to play baseball again. It was something I loved for so long and wasn't doing it. It just seemed like it was missing from my life.''
When Burroughs contacted Wolfe about a comeback last fall, the agent was initially skeptical. "I needed to see him,'' he said. "After five years or however long he was out of the game, you would be skeptical that it would even be realistic that someone would make a comeback. I thought, maybe he'll have to play independent ball. But he showed up and he was a completely different person. He was a man now. His body had completely changed, his body language had completely changed. He was calm and he looked you right in the eye. It was clear that whatever had gone on in his life was behind him.''
Burroughs worked out over the winter at UCLA with several players including Phillies second baseman Chase Utley, who goes back to Little League days with Sean. "I knew he had been through some tough times. But in the time I was with him this offseason, he worked extremely hard,'' Utley said. "I was pretty proud of how he worked in the gym and in the batting cage. You could tell he was definitely motivated. He was always early. It seemed like he was driven.''
Towers said he had lost track of Burroughs until Wolfe called and told him Sean wanted to make a comeback and that the Diamondbacks should take a look at him. Towers and Wolfe have a good relationship, so when the agent told him Burroughs had a good look in his eye, he figured why not. Burroughs signed a minor league contract with the Diamondbacks and went to spring training. He played well enough to get assigned to Reno out of spring training. Barely a month later, he was in the majors.
Burroughs broke down and cried when he got the callup.
"Yes, I was worried but he is such a good kid so I'm always positive that something great would happen for him, whether it was teaching or baseball or whatever, something great would happen, and something great did happen,'' Debbie said. "I was talking to someone in Vegas and they said if they were placing odds, it would be 2 million to one. But if anyone could do it, it would be Sean. I'm just so happy and so thrilled. Just delighted.''
Diamondbacks utility player Xavier Nady was Burroughs' former roommate with the Padres and when Sean was called up, Nady offered to have him live with his family in their house.
"We're just happy we could have him around and provide, to be there,'' Nady said. "I thought that would be a little better situation than sitting in a hotel on a nightly basis. I thought that having him there would be a little better.''
Towers says Burroughs does not undergo any drug tests beyond the standard testing to which all players are subject.
"I trust him," Towers said. "I trust he knows this is probably his last chance. And he's not going to spoil it. The last thing we want to do is say, 'Yeah, let's play at the big league level but we're going to test you individually once a week to make sure.' I think he realizes what's at stake. He's a lot more mature than he was when he was at San Diego. He's going to take advantage of this opportunity and I don't see him screwing up.''
Burroughs hit .250 in a mostly pinch-hit role for the Diamondbacks, but again showed a lack of power as he only had one double and no RBIs in 24 at-bats. Arizona outrighted him to Reno last week. Reno may be minor league compared to its more glamorous Nevada sibling, but given where Burroughs was in Las Vegas just over a year ago, it still represents an impressive and promising leap back to his life. As he said, even his worst day now is better than his best day then.
"It was still great, I'm just grateful to be playing,'' Burroughs said of the demotion to Triple-A. "The callup was only supposed to last a week and it lasted a month. I'm just approaching this as a chance to play every day again. I'm with real good people and a good coaching staff. 
"Right now, I'm living in the present. Live for today. Get myself ready to play ball again, be a good son, be a good brother, a good friend, a good teammate. Try to focus on the positive, I don't want to focus on the negative, that already took up too much of my life.''

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Giants starter Jason Schmidt changed his routine and spent part of his offseason at the Athletes Performance Institute in Tempe, Ariz. He played catch in the mornings with Boston's Curt Schilling, took a crash course in nutrition and hit the weights diligently enough to add 20 pounds, while simultaneously shedding body fat.
Schmidt even switched agents, leaving the SFX group for Michael Moye and Scott Sanderson, whose firm stresses a strong Christian philosophy that's more in line with his faith.
It's the type of extreme makeover an athlete does when he's driven to succeed. In Schmidt's case, it was also a way to leave behind a season that taxed his body, mind and soul.
Schmidt, 33, has been one of Major League Baseball's most reliable starting pitchers in recent years. Since 2003, he ranks third in the game in strikeouts (624), fifth in wins (47) and 10th in ERA (3.24). His .712 winning percentage in that span is second best in the majors behind Minnesota's Johan Santana.


But last year was a struggle from the outset. Schmidt's fastball, which typically reaches the mid-90s, was clocked at 88 mph in spring training and never got appreciably better. As he tried to adapt to his waning velocity, he groped in vain for answers.
Schmidt maintains to this day that his shoulder was never hurt. Was it a case of what baseball people call a "dead arm," or a byproduct of wear-and-tear following elbow surgery and a 225-inning season in 2004?
The ultimate indignity came midway through the season, when Schmidt began hearing rumblings in the San Francisco clubhouse that there was a different reason for his decline. Word got back to him that a teammate or two had speculated that his stuff was slipping because he had stopped taking steroids.
Ballplayers are no different than reporters, fans or scouts; they'll sit in the dugout, see a player with less muscle mass or lower radar gun readings and engage in speculation about who is juicing and who's not.
Schmidt, the forthright sort, admits that occasionally he would sit in the dugout and wonder which players were artificially enhanced. The irony is that he was now a victim of the same baseball parlor game.
"If someone saw me in the shower, they'd never think I was on the juice," Schmidt said.
His experience last year gave him a feel for the scrutiny that teammate Barry Bonds endures -- albeit on a much smaller scale. Although Schmidt refuses to elaborate on the source of the steroid speculation, he was clearly stung by it.
"You don't want to hear stuff like that in your own clubhouse," Schmidt said. "It makes you realize that people don't really know you. That's what made me mad. I felt like, 'These people should know what I stand for and what I'm about -- that I wouldn't do something like that.'
"When you talk about steroids, you're not talking about a guy's physical talents and what he brings to the game. You're talking about what makes him up as a person. The thing that surprised me is that it did irritate me. When it comes from in-house, that really gets to you. I wish people would say, 'You know what, Schmidtty would never do that."
The Giants know that a healthy, productive Schmidt will go a long way toward vaulting them from 75 wins back into contention in a winnable National League West. San Francisco's starting rotation posted a 45-61 record last season with a 4.52 ERA, 12th best in the league. The Giants also ranked 12th in the NL with 940 innings by starters; only the San Diego, Colorado, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati rotations logged lighter workloads.
Given the Giants' traditional emphasis on pitching and their home field advantage at spacious AT&T Park, it's understandable when general manager Brian Sabean says that poor pitching contributed to the team's demise every bit as much as Bonds' absence from the lineup. The Giants ranked 22nd in the majors with 76 quality starts, and the ineffectiveness of the rotation prompted manager Felipe Alou to overuse his bullpen.
"When the rotation doesn't give you innings, it's tough on the manager and tough on the players," Sabean said. "Most playoff teams have consistent staffs, and it begins with the starters."
Today's San Francisco rotation has a much different look than the one that broke camp in April 2005. Schmidt and Noah Lowry are still around, but Kirk Rueter, Brett Tomko and Jerome Williams have been replaced by Matt Morris, Matt Cain and either Brad Hennessey, Jamey Wright or Kevin Correia.
If Schmidt can approximate his form of two years ago, when he went 18-7 with a 3.20 ERA and finished fourth in the Cy Young Award balloting, he gives the Giants an ace who can match up with Pedro Martinez, Chris Carpenter, Roy Oswalt or anyone else the competition has to offer.
In hindsight, Schmidt concedes that he might have contributed to his problems last year with his own stubbornness. When his fastball lost its zip, the natural inclination was to try and throw even harder. That's the way power pitchers are built.
As the season progressed, Schmidt eventually showed he could adapt. He became more proficient at hitting his spots, and the results showed. He went 6-5 with a 5.01 ERA before the All-Star break, and 6-2, 3.66 after it.
Schmidt logged time at Mark Verstegen's API facility in Tempe over the winter with the objective of leaving nothing to chance. His morning get-togethers with Schilling were both educational and therapeutic.
"It was nice to pick his brain a little bit," Schmidt said. "He's a guy I've always learned things from here and there. It was interesting to hear his throwing program and his philosophy on getting ready for the season. I said, 'I'll try something different this year and see what happens.' "
Schmidt's first outing of the spring was promising enough. He threw three shutout innings against the Cubs. But more important than the results was that he had some life on the ball and mixed in some hellacious changeups ahead of schedule.
"When he's on, his command is the biggest thing," Cain said. "His fastball is where he wants it to be, and his changeup is unbelievable."
It remains to be seen how much time Schmidt has left in the Bay Area. He's eligible for free agency in November, and he's noncommittal about re-signing with the Giants. Schmidt grew up in Washington and lives there in the winter, and he ultimately might feel a sentimental tug to return home and pitch for the Seattle Mariners.
At the moment, Schmidt's 2005 travails serve as both a motivational tool and a cautionary tale. He has learned that knee-jerk assumptions are dangerous, and that labels, when applied casually, can hurt more than a man's pride.
"I'm not going to sit here and say I'm perfect," Schmidt said. "I'll sit on the bench and say, 'That guy is a lot skinnier this year. He's not hitting 20 home runs.' But I learned my lesson. I'm not the guy doing that anymore.
"Once the finger was pointed at me, I stepped back and realized I was wrong. Maybe God allowed that to happen to me for a reason, to teach me a lesson. When it's in-house and you know somebody, it's a different story."

PITTSBURGH -- Trevor Hoffman, baseball's career save leader with 498, is about to put the cherry on top. Sometime in the next week, he'll baffle a National or Dodger with a changeup and shake hands with his catcher in celebration of No. 500. The moment will be a tribute to longevity, consistency and Hoffman's ability to thrive while velocity-impaired.
Too bad the poor guy can't find a teammate to play catch with him.
Padres reliever Doug Brocail gave up last year after one too many brushes with the disabled list. Brocail was just returning from a coronary blockage, and he found that catching Hoffman's changeup was as pointless as chasing a fly without a swatter.
"I don't know if the heart problem made me lose some reaction, but it was scaring the hell out of me," Brocail said. "One second, the ball is at your chest. Then, you're just trying to get a glove on it to knock it away from your body. I have a broken glove hand, and if I had to catch him now, the movement alone would do in my fifth metacarpal."
Hoffman smiles at the revelation. For years, the running joke in the San Diego clubhouse is that teammates feared playing catch with him because they eventually got traded or sent to the minors. Hoffman's throwing partners had a more fleeting shelf life than Spinal Tap drummers.
"I can't think of anybody in particular," Hoffman said, "but over the years, guys I play catch with tend to disappear."
For the record, Hoffman now warms up with the San Diego trainers. They're doing a fine job of helping him maintain his touch.
At 39 years and eight months, Hoffman keeps finding ways to frustrate hitters. He ranks third in the league with 16 saves, and NL hitters are batting .171 against him. He's converted 12 straight saves covering 13 1/3 scoreless innings, with 10 strikeouts and one walk in that span.
Those numbers reflect the gaudy stats Hoffman has compiled during an illustrious career. He bests Mariano Rivera, the man many consider the greatest closer in history, in strikeouts and baserunners allowed per nine innings. And with his 89.6 percent conversion rate, Hoffman has one more blown save than Rivera (58 to 57) in 82 more opportunities.
"Heck, there are numbers inside of the numbers," Brocail said. Did you know, for example, that Hoffman recently appeared in his 803rd game with San Diego, breaking the record for games pitched with a single club? Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators and Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates are now tied for second with 802.
It's Hoffman's style to knock politely on the door of history. When he notched his 479th career save last September to break Lee Smith's record, a capacity crowd of 43,168 was on hand in San Diego. It was Sunday afternoon on the East Coast, and millions of baseball fans were either oblivious or mowing their lawns.
There was no national debate over whether Bud Selig should be in attendance. The commissioner called with his congratulations, and for that gracious gesture, Hoffman was eternally grateful.
Hall of Fame bound?
As Hoffman pursues the magic 500, the lack of buzz is palpable. It's due in part to ambivalence over the save, a statistic routinely derided as cheap by the media. When so many pitchers drive BMWs because they've put the clamps on 5-2 victories, skepticism naturally follows.
That's the cold, clinical, purely statistical argument. In the real world, unsettled closer situations can undermine seasons and produce chaos in abundance. That helps explain why Boston kept Jonathan Papelbon, a 15-18 game-winner-in-waiting, in the bullpen this season. And just ask Cleveland fans how much fun it was watching Fausto Carmona finish games in 2006.
"A lot of pitchers don't have the stomach for the role, but Trevor pitches with absolutely no fear," said Padres manager Bud Black. "He doesn't back down. He goes after the big boys, and he doesn't pitch around guys. He truly is the aggressor, and I think that's a great quality."

Profile

That gunslinger mentality notwithstanding, Hoffman revels in his anonymity in San Diego. He freely admits that it's easier for him to work through the occasional hard times than it is for, say, Rivera or Billy Wagner in the fishbowl of New York.
While Rivera's legacy is enhanced by his October heroics, Hoffman has endured some painful hiccups on the national stage. He gave up a three-run homer to Scott Brosius in Game 3 of the 1998 World Series, and blew a save in the 2006 All-Star Game to cost the National League homefield advantage in the World Series.
Will those high-profile failures hurt Hoffman's Cooperstown chances? As an exercise in crystal-ball gazing, ESPN.com polled more than 60 Hall of Fame voters, and it appears Hoffman will avoid the anguish that plagued Bruce Sutter (who made it on his 13th try) and Goose Gossage and Smith, who are still on the ballot.
Out of 62 responses, 58 baseball writers said they plan to vote "yes" on Hoffman for Cooperstown. Four were undecided, and there wasn't a flat "no" in the bunch.
Dan Graziano of the Newark Star-Ledger points out that Hoffman has posted a sub-3.00 ERA every year but one since 1996, made five All-Star teams, and finished in the top six in Cy Young voting four times and in the top 10 in MVP voting twice.
"I don't think much of the save as a stat," Graziano said, "but I'm looking at a guy who's been a lockdown closer for more than a decade. Closers are a real and important part of the game, and either he or Rivera has been the best one for the past decade."
As Hoffman approaches 500, each day unfolds like a "this is your life" segment. This week, he passed through Pittsburgh, where Jim Tracy is manager and Jim Lett is the Pirates' bench coach.
Tracy managed Hoffman with Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991, after Hoffman hit .212 as a shortstop for Class A Charleston (W.Va.) under Lett. It was Lett who suggested the Reds move him from infielder to pitcher after the 1990 season.
No one knows for sure how Hoffman's career would have unfolded without that plot twist, but it's possible he would have gone home and become a coach or physical education teacher.
"He was a good enough athlete, and the ball came out of his hand so easy," Lett said. "With his arm strength, we figured, 'What do we have to lose?' But who would have ever thought this would happen? It was like winning the lottery."
This weekend, Hoffman travels to Washington, home of general manager Jim Bowden. In 1992, Bowden made the regrettable decision to leave Hoffman off Cincinnati's 15-man expansion draft protected list. The Marlins selected him, then traded him to San Diego seven months later in a deal that brought Gary Sheffield to Florida.
Monument to durability
Hoffman has gone through various incarnations in San Diego. He once threw in the mid-90s, but hurt his shoulder in 1994 and learned to do more with less. He forever will be linked to the changeup in the same way Rivera has a claim on the cut fastball and Sutter is synonymous with the splitter. Since the changeup puts less strain on the arm than a split or hard slider, the pitch probably contributed to Hoffman's longevity.
"The amazing thing is how goofy some hitters look," Brocail said. "If you watch video of Trevor and slow it down, I'd swear to God you'd think his changeup was a knuckleball. It's there and gone. See ya. Bye."
With the exception of shoulder problems that limited him to nine innings in 2003, Hoffman has been remarkably durable. It's not by accident. Four hours before a game, you'll find him running in the outfield or doing stretching exercises with rubber tubing. He's usually clad in a light blue hospital smock that's practically welded to his body.
It was big news in San Diego recently when Black used Scott Linebrink to close a game against Milwaukee because Hoffman had a "cranky'' shoulder, but Hoffman returned for two straight saves against the Brewers. He recorded No. 498 Thursday in Pittsburgh.


Doug Brocail

Beyond the numbers, Hoffman defines professionalism in every way imaginable. He makes it a point to stand at his locker and hold himself accountable on the rare occasions when he fails. He's also a charity machine and a two-time winner of the Padres' Roberto Clemente Award.
Kevin Kouzmanoff, San Diego's rookie third baseman, emerged from the shower after a spring training game in Arizona and was stunned to see Hoffman, clad in a clubhouse attendant's shirt, gathering the dirty laundry and cleaning his teammates' spikes.
"I asked him, 'Hoffy, what are you doing?' '' Kouzmanoff said. "And he was like, 'I'm helping out whatever way I can.' "
When Hoffman broke Lee Smith's career save record in September, he made sure to tip his cap to Lett and Tracy in the Pittsburgh dugout. It was his way of thanking them for their role in jump-starting his career.
According to Lett, Hoffman hasn't changed one iota since he pitched in Charleston, W.Va. He enjoys a good prank and loves the thrill of the competition, and you always know what you're going to get -- right down to the "Hells Bells'' theme song when the bullpen gate swings open.
Forget the "specialist'' label. Bud Black pays Hoffman the ultimate tribute when he calls him a baseball player who just happens to pitch the ninth inning.
"There are going to be down times when you blow a save and doubt creeps into your head,'' Hoffman said. "That's when you have to be strong enough to know you've done something well over time and trust your stuff. You have to be your biggest fan.''
Hoffman takes a backseat to no one at the art of closing games. But if he plans to be his biggest fan, he'll have to get in line.

The Chicago-Texas series arrived this week with a little extra intrigue, in the form of a budding feud between the Rangers' closer and the White Sox manager.
In this corner: C.J. Wilson, aspiring novelist, Taoist, movie critic, Guitar Hero devotee and a California free spirit in the Barry Zito mold.

Wilson


Guillen

In the other corner: Ozzie Guillen, former All-Star shortstop-turned-World Series skipper, old-school guy, beat writer's best friend and serial provocateur.
During a recent series in Arlington, Guillen ripped Wilson for his demeanor on the mound. He called Wilson "cocky" and accused him of lacking "class" and showing up Chicago's hitters.
Like many Guillen showdowns, this one was as fleeting as a midsummer rainstorm. Guillen seemed determined to let things die Monday, and Wilson took a pass on the inflammatory rhetoric -- telling reporters that he just likes "throwing hard and having a Mohawk and being an idiot." Barring a sudden surge of testosterone from one combatant or the other, you can file the incident in the soon-to-be-forgotten bin.
But rest assured that another battle royale will soon take its place. It's almost irrelevant whether Guillen lands in controversy because of his competitive drive or as a way to take the pressure off his players. His "feuds" have become as predictable as car exhaust on the Dan Ryan Expressway.
Sorting through Guillen's run-ins is like picking your favorite Bruce Springsteen CD, but we gamely venture ahead. This week's installment of Starting 9 runs down the most memorable Ozzie Guillen tirades, rants and other dustups from his 4½ seasons as Chicago manager, and ranks them on a 1 to 10 severity scale, with 10 being the most severe.
Sorry if your personal favorite failed to make the cut. Even with the luxury of some honorable mentions at the end, we had to draw the line somewhere.

Ordonez

The dispute: They're fellow Venezuelan natives, and they were full of praise for each other as White Sox teammates in 1997. Magglio Ordonez once referred to Guillen as "a big hero in my country," and Guillen called Ordonez a great hitter, even though he has "an ugly Latino name."
But something has to give when Ordonez leaves the White Sox to sign a free-agent deal with Detroit in February 2005. A few seemingly benign comments from Ordonez about his departure from Chicago are twisted and contorted, and they pick up steam until Guillen believes he's the guy who's blamed for running Ordonez out of town.
Before you know it, Ordonez is calling Guillen "my enemy," and Guillen refers to his former teammate as "a piece of [expletive]." Things proceed to go downhill from there, if that's possible.
The money quote: "He played with the wrong guy," Guillen tells Playboy Magazine the next spring. "He was bad-mouthing my team. He was bad-mouthing my trainer. He was bad-mouthing my general manager. He was bad-mouthing my owner. He was bad-mouthing my organization. But when he said Ozzie -- uh-oh. As soon as he named me, it was on."
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 10. Though time helps heal the rift eventually, this one has all the requisite elements -- friendship gone awry, nationalistic pride, contrasting interpretations of loyalty, and a little Scott Boras on the side. Bystanders insist the anger from both parties was genuine.
"If they would have met face-to-face, there's a chance somebody wouldn't have come out alive," says Mark Gonzales, the White Sox beat reporter for the Chicago Tribune.

Mariotti

Guillen, incensed that Chicago pitcher Sean Tracey won't plunk Hank Blalock as a retaliatory move, slams a water bottle, yells at Tracey in the dugout and pulls him in the seventh inning of a White Sox-Rangers game.
Jay Mariotti, Chicago Sun-Times columnist and "Around the Horn" panel regular, is outraged over Guillen's behavior. He calls the display "senseless and immature."
Guillen, not one to take constructive criticism in stride, fires back by using a homosexual slur to describe Mariotti. The commissioner's office takes note, fines Guillen and orders him to undergo sensitivity training. Then the episode assumes a "Surreal Life" aura when Guillen's gay hairdresser issues a public endorsement and Ozzie tells his fans that he enjoys watching WNBA games in his free time.
The money quote: "He's garbage, still garbage, going to die as garbage," Guillen says of Mariotti.
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 8. Mariotti is a persistent Guillen critic who refers to the White Sox manager as the "Blizzard of Oz." He's particularly adept at hitting a nerve when he rips club chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, a man Guillen reveres.
Guillen's main beef is that Mariotti is so quick to cast judgment without setting foot in the White Sox clubhouse. Mariotti claims he stopped going to Sox games because he's been subjected to physical threats and the team has refused to confront the issue.
"Why he's so afraid to show up to the ballpark?  Tell him we'll pay his cab," Guillen says in 2006. "Tell him to tell us where he lives, and we'll bring him to the ballpark and we'll have a conversation."

Wendelstedt

The dispute: Guillen charges out of the dugout during a Chicago-Cleveland game to contest an out called on a stolen-base attempt by White Sox outfielder Carlos Lee. He denies spitting tobacco juice on Wendelstedt during their argument, but his actions still earn him a two-game suspension and a $1,000 fine.
The punishment is doubled when Guillen alleges that Wendelstedt -- the son of longtime umpire Harry Wendelstedt -- lied in his game report.
The money quote: "You're not even a pimple on your daddy's ass," Guillen tells Wendelstedt.
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 7. Grousing about a call is one thing, but publicly questioning an umpire's integrity is not a great way to lay the foundation for a productive long-term relationship.
The confrontation: After Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski tells the Chicago radio host he's upset about being replaced in the starting lineup by backup Toby Hall, Guillen goes all Curt Schilling. He calls The Score 670 and goes on a profanity-filled tirade as Mike North implores him to watch his language.
"This would be the sports equivalent of George Carlin duct-taping Chris Rock's mouth," Mariotti later writes in the Chicago Sun-Times.
The money quote: "How you doing, Ozzie?" North says.
"Oh, shut the [bleep] up," Guillen replies.
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 6. Shortly after the radio run-in, North brings a box of chocolates to Guillen's office as a goodwill gesture. According to the Chicago Tribune, Guillen throws the candy in the trash.
Once the hostilities subside, Guillen takes his lumps for using such vulgar language on the airwaves, where kids and their grandmothers can hear it. When North's 16-year tenure as a Chicago radio host ends a little more than a year later, the incident is mentioned prominently as part of his legacy.
"We only can hope that the end of Mike North is the beginning of decency, professionalism and couth in Chicago sports radio," Mariotti writes in the Sun-Times.

Williams

The dispute: Guillen and Kenny Williams played together for three years in Chicago in the late 1980s. They won a title together in 2005 and bucked each other up through a long, trying summer in 2007.
As a rule, Williams tries to take Guillen's provocative comments in stride because he knows that candor and directness are part of his manager's leadership mojo. He generally is content to let Ozzie be Ozzie.
But things get testy when Chicago's offense stalls and Guillen responds with veiled criticisms of hitting coach Greg Walker and a suggestion that the general manager should bring in some new players. Williams, who already acquired Nick Swisher, Carlos Quentin and Orlando Cabrera in the offseason, isn't quick to embrace the advice.
The money quote: "It's never a good idea to throw your boss under the bus, especially when that boss has had his back as much as I have,'' Williams tells the Chicago Sun-Times.
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 6. The two friends hash things out, and a dormant Chicago lineup proceeds to outscore Kansas City and Minnesota 61-26 during a seven-game win streak. But judging from Williams' initial crankiness, this is not a routine that Guillen should allow to become habit-forming.

Showalter

The dispute: People love recounting this run-in because of the stark contrast in styles. Buck Showalter, with his militaristic attention to detail, is the ultimate baseball perfectionist. As for Ozzie, well, he's more your seat-of-the-pants type of guy.
There's a minor dispute about Rangers reliever John Wetteland's coaching first base, and Guillen infers from the postgame interviews that Showalter thinks he didn't know the rules. He takes that as a signal to commence bashing.
The money quote: "[Showalter] never even smelled a jock in the big leagues," Guillen says. "Mr. Baseball never even got a hit in Triple-A. I was a better player than him, I have more money than him and I'm better looking than him."
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 5. Showalter defuses the controversy by staying above the fray, but he can't be thrilled when the White Sox bring out a lineup card that includes team photos and faux e-mail addresses. The joke is an apparent dig at Texas coach Don Wakamatsu's meticulously prepared lineup cards.
"Buck does everything on the straight and narrow, and Ozzie was just messing with him," one Guillen watcher says. "It was like swatting at a hornet's nest."

Hill

The dispute: Emotions run high when the White Sox and Cubs meet in an interleague series, and things get out of hand when A.J. Pierzynski plows into Cubs catcher Michael Barrett before the throw arrives from the outfield. When Cubs pitcher Rich Hill refers to Pierzynski's play as "gutless" and "pathetic," it's all Guillen needs to hear.
The money quote: "Tell that Triple-A [bleep] to shut the [bleep] up," Guillen says. "Tell him to start throwing some strikes or he's going to get Dusty [Baker] fired."
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 5. Hill is just an earnest kid standing up for a teammate, but the subsequent chain of events sure make Ozzie look like a visionary. Hill is demoted to Triple-A Iowa the day after the incident, and Baker is, indeed, fired by the Cubs after the 2006 season.

Duncan

The dispute: As the first Latino manager to guide a team to a World Series title, Guillen prides himself on being a trailblazer. So he takes it personally when Dodgers coach Mariano Duncan, a native of the Dominican Republic, says he's embarrassing fellow Hispanics and potentially hurting their chances of managing in the big leagues.
The money quote: "He embarrassed every Latino player, coach and front-office person," Duncan tells the Los Angeles Times. "Ozzie is a hero in his country and a hero in my country. We are here in America, where you can speak freely. But you don't say everything that comes to your mind. He has to learn to slow down a little bit. You have to learn how to close your mouth."
Guillen's reply: "Mariano Duncan never will be a big league manager and not because I ruined it for him. If Mariano Duncan thinks being a manager is making out the lineup and changing pitchers, he is real wrong."
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 5. This one doesn't have much of a shelf life, but it provides an interesting glimpse at how Guillen is regarded in the baseball community. For everyone who loves him, is amused by him and respects his accomplishments, there's somebody else who cringes and wonders what the heck he was thinking when he said what he said.

McCarthy

The dispute: After being traded from the White Sox to the Rangers, Brandon McCarthy tells reporters he's more comfortable with the atmosphere in Texas than Chicago, where he and outfielder Brian Anderson were the only players who weren't married or didn't have steady girlfriends.
McCarthy has no clue what he's gotten himself into. Guillen takes the comments personally and rips McCarthy for spending too much time in Chicago on the town having fun with Anderson.
The money quote: "You played with us 162 games and all of a sudden you leave and say you don't have a friend in the clubhouse, only Brian Anderson?" Guillen says. "Well, he picked the wrong guy to be friends with."
Rank on the Ozzie meter: 3. This is a classic case of Guillen popping off for the sport of it. McCarthy gives him a call, they hash things over, and Guillen tells the writers, "The kid has a chance to be a good pitcher. Everything's clear and good."
• Frank Thomas: Guillen has had several head-butting sessions with Thomas in Chicago, but their issues pale in comparison to GM Kenny Williams' distaste for the Big Hurt -- which is off the charts.
• Phil Garner: After Guillen says Garner snubbed him during the pre-World Series handshakes in 2005, Garner provides photos as evidence to the contrary. In the midst of the Mariotti furor, Garner wonders whether Guillen might want to consider counseling to address his personal issues.
• Dave Duncan: The St. Louis pitching coach calls Guillen a liar during a radio interview in June 2006 following a beanball incident between the White Sox and Cardinals.
• Umpire Phil Cuzzi: Guillen is not a fan. "I just let him know I don't like him the first day I see him, and I think he feels the same way about me. And we have to move on," Ozzie says after Cuzzi ejects him from a White Sox-Twins game this past April.
• Andy Van Slyke: After watching Guillen berate Jon Garland for failing to throw a retaliation pitch against Detroit, Van Slyke tells a radio interviewer that he would have punched Guillen if he were in Garland's shoes. Van Slyke later apologizes, but not before Ozzie slips in a shot or two of his own.
"That's why he's coaching first base and I'm managing in the big leagues," Guillen says. "I'm going to manage in the big leagues longer than he's going to coach first base."

The Hot Stove season is off to a fine start for Ryan Dempster, Jeremy Affeldt and Eri Yoshida, the 16-year-old female knuckleballer who was drafted by a Japanese League club this week. And life is good if your name happens to be CC Sabathia, Mark Teixeira, Manny Ramirez or A.J. Burnett.
For lots of other job seekers, it could be a long, stressful winter ahead.
No species is more endangered than the fading star nearing the end of his career. Just flash back to last winter -- when Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mike Piazza, Kenny Lofton and Reggie Sanders were among the players who went unsigned -- and certain conclusions are inevitable.
For starters, it's clear that big league teams are no longer willing to overpay for name recognition or past achievements. That's not about to change with the U.S. in a recession and season-ticket renewals and sponsorship dollars in potential decline.
The success of the Tampa Bay Rays and Minnesota Twins, among others, has also reinforced the notion that baseball is a young man's game these days. The 162-game haul is more challenging than ever for older players now that steroids and amphetamines are on the banned list.
If an aging star is willing to wait until February, swallow his pride, cut his asking price and accept a minor league invite to spring training, he has a leg up on the competition. Otherwise, the employment outlook is dicey.
"The biggest issue with a lot of these guys is their pedigree and, to some extent, their ego," said an American League executive. "If you're willing to sign a non-roster deal, someone will take a chance on you. But the majority of these guys won't do that, so they may be left to retire."
In September, we assessed the outlook for nine star pitchers in their twilight years. In this Hot Stove edition of "Starting 9," we gauge the job prospects for nine prominent position players in their late 30s and early 40s.
The players mentioned below have combined for four MVP awards, 22 Silver Sluggers and 47 All-Star appearances. Will they find a landing spot between now and spring training? We rate their chances on a 0 to 100 scale.

Edmonds


Two reasons there should be no shortage of interest in Jimmy Ballgame:
• He put up a .568 slugging percentage with the Cubs, with 19 homers in 250 at-bats. Once Edmonds recovered from a calf injury that dogged him in spring training -- and regained his enthusiasm after being shipped from a lost cause in San Diego to a contender in Chicago -- he looked awfully spry for a 38-year-old.
It's worth noting that Edmonds had also been slowed by concussion-related issues late in his tenure with St. Louis, and those are now in the past.
• Edmonds is looking for only a one-year deal. For cost-conscious clubs -- and who isn't these days? -- that short-term horizon should enhance his appeal.
"I think it's going to be a win-win for somebody," said Paul Cohen, Edmonds' agent. "When you look at what some of the other guys will go for and you stack up their slugging percentage and home runs per at-bat against Jim's, it's going to be interesting."
Edmonds is also chasing a niche in history: He needs 18 home runs to join Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Schmidt and Andre Dawson as the sixth player in history to hit 400 homers and win eight Gold Gloves.
It's hard to say where Edmonds fits, but Atlanta, Seattle and the White Sox are among the teams that might be in the mix for an outfielder. And Walt Jocketty, Edmonds' former general manager in St. Louis, is now running the show in Cincinnati, where the outfield alignment currently consists of Jay Bruce, Chris Dickerson and Norris Hopper. But the Reds appear more interested in acquiring a right-handed bat than a lefty hitter.

Anderson


The Angels declined a $14 million club option on Anderson after the season, but haven't ruled out bringing him back in 2009 at a more reasonable price.
At the moment, Anderson is well down the pecking order of priorities. Francisco Rodriguez, Jon Garland and Juan Rivera might all be leaving through free agency, and Mark Teixeira wants huge money to stay, so GM Tony Reagins has more pressing items than Anderson on his agenda.
Even if Anderson is still available when the Angels are ready to make a move, the team might decide to commit to prospect Brandon Wood at third base and shift Chone Figgins to left field. (As an aside, Wood was just released by his winter league team after hitting .167 in 13 games in the Dominican Republic.)
Anderson's .433 slugging percentage this year was 15th-best among the 17 left fielders with enough at-bats to qualify for the batting title (only Skip Schumaker and Delmon Young were worse). And get this: In 14 years as an Angel, he has yet to draw 40 walks in a season.
But Anderson is only 36, and he has enough life left in his bat to stick around a while. He'll just have to wait to see where Adam Dunn, Raul Ibanez, Bobby Abreu et al surface before his 2009 destination becomes clear.
"He still probably has two or three years left," said a National League front office man.

Griffey


It's hard to believe, but this is the first time in Griffey's two decades in the major leagues that he has filed for free agency. He has always valued security and comfort over chasing the biggest megadeal.
Junior isn't going to inspire any bidding wars this time. He turns 39 on Friday, and his best days as an outfielder are behind him. He'll probably have to accept a role as a combination outfielder-first baseman-DH, and a $5 million contract might be generous given the current economic climate.
But Griffey showed enough skill in 2009 that someone should take a shot at him. Although he hit only three homers in 131 at-bats after joining the White Sox in late July, he was playing on a tender left knee that had to be drained three times and required arthroscopic surgery in October.
Seattle, as always, tops the Griffey speculation list. The White Sox had nice things to say about Griffey when they declined to pick up his option in October. And while Tampa Bay has other priorities, the Rays might consider Junior as a right field-DH option if Cliff Floyd doesn't return.

Floyd


When we last saw Floyd, he was being replaced by Eric Hinske on Tampa Bay's World Series roster because of a torn labrum in his shoulder. Shortly after the Rays fell to the Phillies in Game 5, Floyd vowed to retire rather than undergo surgery on the shoulder.
Now it appears that Floyd's stance is softening. Last week, he told the St. Petersburg Times that he might have the shoulder surgically repaired in an effort to make a run at one more season. Floyd's agents, Seth and Sam Levinson, could not be reached for comment.
The Rays declined to exercise Floyd's $2.75 million option for next season, but they're leaving the door open for a return. Floyd is a tremendous influence in the clubhouse, and that .804 OPS in 246 at-bats was his best in three years.  On the downside, it's harder than ever to find a body part that he hasn't pulled, strained, torn or rehabilitated.
Floyd's .356 career batting average at Tropicana Field is second-best in the ballpark's history behind Bernie Williams, so maybe the Rays can re-sign him for half-price and just ask him to suit up for home games.

Kent


Kent is one of the biggest puzzles on this list. He had a big August (.343 batting average, .380 OBP) to help the Dodgers climb back into the NL West race, and lots of people think he has enough bat speed left to contribute somewhere. But age and all those leg injuries have killed his mobility in the field, and he might be best-suited to an American League club, where he could play some DH, first base and a little second.
"I really think he'll hit a fastball until he's 50," said a scout. "The question is, does he want to [keep playing]? If he can't do it all-out every day, I don't think he has any interest. The way he was going about his business towards the end, I just sensed that it was over."
Needless to say, Kent does not have a reputation as a guy who'll smile and embrace a role as a 350-400 at-bat mentor to the kids. No offense, but is there a player in baseball with more of a reputation for casting a pall over a clubhouse?
Agent Jeff Klein said that Kent is "torn" at the moment over whether to keep playing or retire. Kent has four children ranging in age from 5 to 12, and those 10-day road trips aren't getting any easier.
"He's going to make the decision the right way," Klein said. "He's going to look in his heart and talk to his family. His kids are growing up, and he has an enormous pull for his family."
Klein disagreed with the notion that Kent is ill-suited for a part-time role on a club.
"I don't think that's the issue at all," Klein said. "When was the last time anybody's role was defined in February and turned out to be the same in September?"

Garciaparra


Agent Arn Tellem said Garciaparra is "considering his options" for 2009. Even if there's a market for Garciaparra's services, he has yet to determine if he wants to play.
Garciaparra can still hit left-handed pitching (.339 in 56 at-bats), and he was versatile enough to appear at third base, shortstop and first base last season in Los Angeles. But it's the same old story with the injuries. He missed 90 games with a fractured right hand, a strained left calf and an irritation in his left knee.
"Where can he play in the field and stay healthy for a whole season?" said a scout. "Nowhere, other than first base. And he doesn't carry enough thunder to be a first baseman or a DH."
Garciaparra enjoys being home in his native Southern California, where his parents and sisters can watch him play regularly at Dodger Stadium. If he's willing to accept a bench job for a low base salary, maybe he'll squeeze out another season in L.A. Or maybe he'll decide it's been a nice ride and call it a day.

Gonzalez


Gonzalez's image as a veteran mentor took a hit with the Dodgers in 2007, but he rehabilitated it last season in Florida. He accepted a bench role, helped teach the young Marlins something about professionalism and accountability, and won the team Good Guy Award from the media.
But Gonzalez isn't in the Marlins' plans for 2009, and as he told the Miami Herald in September, it will take a "good fit" for him to play next year.
"I'm not going to go somewhere just to play a 19th season," he said.
There was some brief speculation about Gonzalez's returning to Arizona for a final go-round, but it had no basis in reality. Gonzalez's departure two years ago was a PR nightmare for Arizona management, and the Diamondbacks privately say they have no interest in revisiting the arrangement.
Gonzalez is good for only a day or two a week in the outfield, and that .413 slugging percentage in 2008 (with eight homers in 341 at-bats) doesn't bode well for a designated hitter role. He's also one of a slew of lefty-hitting outfielders on the market this winter. The list includes Dunn, Ibanez and Abreu, along with the first three players on this "Starting 9" list.
If Gonzalez does pack it in, he'll finish with 596 doubles -- 15th in the all-time rankings. That's even more impressive than his four career "Good Guy" awards.

Thomas


Unlike some players in this group, Thomas is determined to come back and play another season. With 521 career homers, he's tied with Ted Williams and Willie McCovey for 18th place on the all-time list. But the market for 40-year-old designated hitters with leg and foot problems isn't exactly thriving.
Thomas is only two years removed from a 39-homer, 114-RBI season in Oakland, but he's not in the A's plans for 2009. After using the disabled list 47 times the past two seasons, the A's have sworn off aging veterans in the Thomas-Piazza-Mike Sweeney mold and decided to go young in the field.
Which team might give Thomas a shot? The six clubs with the worst production from the DH slot last year were Kansas City, Toronto, Oakland, Cleveland (with an injured Travis Hafner), Detroit and Seattle. If you can find a natural fit among that group, feel free to give us a call.

Alou


Alou can still turn on a fastball. The big challenge is making it up the dugout steps.
Over the past five seasons, Alou's at-bat total has gradually declined from 610 with the Chicago Cubs to 49 last season in New York. He made his 16th and 17th trips to the disabled list in 2008 and played one game after May 21.
Barring another comeback attempt, Alou will finish with an .885 on base-slugging percentage (better than Harmon Killebrew and Sammy Sosa), 1,287 RBIs (more than Hank Greenberg, Gil Hodges and Edgar Martinez) and one very memorable encounter with a guy named Steve Bartman.

In early February, a switch-hitting second baseman's thoughts turn to loading the bags on the spring training equipment truck, sneaking in a few extra rounds in the batting cage to stay sharp, and kissing the wife and kids goodbye on the way to the airport for Florida or Arizona.
But this is not your garden variety spring, so Ray Durham sits at home in Charlotte, N.C., wondering about his future. Is he destined to spend this summer golfing, fishing, grilling out and watching his two kids play ball? Could this really be the end?
One prominent second baseman, Jeff Kent, has left the game of his own accord this winter. After 14 big league seasons and 2,054 hits, Durham might soon join him. He wants to play in 2009, but circumstances have left him at "50-50'" on the possibility of retirement.
"I'm ready to play, but if that doesn't come, I'm happy with retirement," Durham said. "I play the game because I love it. Sometimes it's not all about money. You want to be treated fairly, too."
As pitchers and catchers prepare to report to camps next week, the list of accomplished hitters in professional purgatory is stunning. Manny Ramirez, Adam Dunn, Bobby Abreu, Orlando Hudson, Ken Griffey Jr., Garret Anderson, Jim Edmonds, Joe Crede, Pudge Rodriguez, Orlando Cabrera, Luis Gonzalez and, yes, Durham are among those in search of a bailout plan.
The reasons for the unemployment surge -- from the economic climate to a game-wide preference for younger players -- have been documented ad nauseam. Things are bad enough that Major League Baseball and the Players Association have considered setting up a spring training camp where wayward free agents can stay in shape and audition for clubs in need.
Still, that doesn't make the wait any easier for players who are balancing pride with a grim reality, and believe they've done enough not to have to beg for jobs.
"Even when I was in the minor leagues, I always said that I want to go out on my own terms," Durham said. "I didn't want to stay around if I couldn't continue to play at a high level. I wanted it to be my decision.
"That's the whole thing -- I haven't even had an offer to turn down this winter. If I had something to think about, I could at least weigh my options one way or another. I haven't even had anything to say 'no' to."
In light of Durham's performance in 2008, he has reason to be puzzled over the lack of interest. After a 2007 season so unproductive that many clubs figured he was finished, he's coming off a year that was extraordinary in several respects:
• Durham amassed 35 doubles in 370 at-bats with San Francisco and Milwaukee, joining Larry Walker of the 1994 Montreal Expos as only the second player in 67 years to produce 35 or more doubles in 400 or fewer at-bats.
• His .380 on base percentage tied him with Philadelphia's Chase Utley for best among big league second basemen in 2008.
• He hit .310 with a .905 on base-slugging percentage in "close and late" situations, and produced a .956 OPS when the Brewers were fighting for a playoff spot in September.
Durham's agent, Ed Setlik, prepared a 23-page document detailing his accomplishments and distributed it to front offices. While Hudson was allegedly scaring off second base suitors with his high asking price, Setlik told clubs that Durham would be willing to take a one-year deal with some deferred money. Durham also comes with no draft-pick strings attached for the club that signs him.
Nevertheless, Durham hasn't gotten a sniff. The only thing resembling interest came from the Cardinals, who called to inquire how he might feel about a backup role to Adam Kennedy at second base. But St. Louis never made a formal offer.
One by one, the other possibilities dried up. Cleveland decided to keep Asdrubal Cabrera at second and Jhonny Peralta at shortstop and trade for third baseman Mark DeRosa. Arizona signed Felipe Lopez for one year at $3.5 million. The White Sox plan to give prospect Chris Getz first crack at second base, and Milwaukee is sticking with Rickie Weeks.


“
I haven't even had an offer to turn down this winter. If I had something to think about, I could at least weigh my options one way or another. I haven't even had anything to say 'no' to.
”

Setlik talked to both New York clubs, but the Yankees are looking for a bounce-back year from Robinson Cano, and the Mets are in no position to add a second baseman with Luis Castillo due $18 million over the next three seasons. If GM Omar Minaya were inclined to spend money on the position, the Mets would have made a run at Hudson.
At age 37, Durham isn't the athletic marvel he used to be. He hasn't stolen 20 bases in a season since 2002. And while he's relatively sure-handed in the field, he's below average at turning the double play and ranked 31st among second basemen in the Fielding Bible's plus-minus rankings in 2008.
But as one front office man observed, "You're buying a pretty good offensive player." Durham is a career .279 hitter from the right side, and .277 from the left. He's hit .278 at home and .277 on the road, and has a career .275 average before the All-Star break and a .280 mark after it. He's consistent to the point of mind-numbing.
"I know I'm biased, but I also know what I see," Setlik said. "Ray might have lost some of his physical edge, but I think he's got a lot of juice in the tank."
Durham has told his agent that he won't grovel for a job. He doesn't expect a salary approaching his $7.5 million in 2008, but he's also not interested in a minor league invite or the $800,000 utility infielder plan.
"We're willing to take a little bit of a haircut, but not a scalping," Setlik said.
As the wait persists, Durham works up a sweat each day at his home in North Carolina. He hits and throws, lifts weights and does speed and agility drills. He hasn't spoken with many out-of-work peers this winter, but former teammate Frank Thomas did call at one point to commiserate about the job market.
Durham has set no personal deadlines to hook on with a club, but concedes it would be difficult to arrive in camp in, say, early March and try to catch up. Regardless of what happens, he's more matter-of-fact than angry or bitter over MLB's new world order.
"Your mega-superstars are gonna get theirs regardless, and your lower-end guys are going to get theirs," Durham said. "It's the middle guys who are going to be left out. Right now teams would rather pick up a guy from A-ball or Double-A to fill a roster spot and save money. I've been around this game long enough to know that money talks."
Money has never spoken more forcefully or emphatically than in this desolate winter on the MLB free-agent market. With each uneventful day that passes, Durham and his fellow job-seekers are discovering just how little say they have in the matter.

The Pittsburgh Pirates run through pitching coaches the way Primanti Brothers churns out coleslaw and fries. Try four different voices in the past five years, during which the team's starters never finished better than 21st in the major leagues in ERA.
Which makes you wonder: Is it less about the man giving the instructions than the guys who are actually throwing the ball?
That didn't stop general manager Neal Huntington from making another change this offseason in an effort to set things right. After Spin Williams, Jim Colborn and Jeff Andrews all took a crack at maximizing the potential of the Pirates' staff, Huntington dipped into his past and contacted an old friend with an offer of a turnaround special.
Huntington was 25 years old in 1992 and looking for a way to put his Amherst College psychology degree to good use when he landed a job in the Montreal Expos' front office. As the team's video advance scout, he worked closely with Joe Kerrigan, then Felipe Alou's pitching coach and a man who seemed ahead of the curve with his fondness for dissecting video and incorporating statistics in his game plans.
Over the next 14 years, Kerrigan passed through Boston, Philadelphia and New York with mixed results. For every admirer who hailed him for his preparation and brilliant baseball mind, there was a corresponding critic who regarded him as stubborn, heavy-handed or, worst of all, a condescending know-it-all.
After Kerrigan clashed with Brett Myers, Randy Wolf and Kevin Millwood to hasten his departure from the Phillies, a Philadelphia reporter wrote that he had devolved from the "The Professor'' to "Joe Almighty'' in his two seasons with the club.
"Joe is intense, passionate, driven, knowledgeable and not afraid to share his opinion,'' Huntington said. "There are times when guys don't want to hear opinions about their performance and what they need to do to get better. But in our situation, we needed somebody to come in here that had a proven track record and could help us get better. We thought that Joe was that guy.''
If Pittsburgh's young pitchers were at all dubious, they only needed to embrace reality. When your franchise hasn't finished .500 since 1992, it's not as though you have a right to be choosy.
"We weren't good last year, so we're very open to hearing new information and new criticisms,'' Zach Duke said. "And we're willing to work to get better.''
While April has brought surprising starts in Seattle and Toronto, another upbeat story is taking shape in Pittsburgh. True, it's only three weeks, but the Pirates are 11-8 despite a slew of early injuries. They rank second in the major leagues with a 3.36 ERA even after a bullpen implosion ruined a comeback bid in a 10-5 loss to Milwaukee on Monday.
This is precisely the synergy that Huntington was hoping for when he plucked Kerrigan from his role as a studio analyst with Comcast SportsNet in Philadelphia to mentor Pittsburgh's young pitchers.
The Pirates staff ranked 28th or worse in the majors in numerous categories last year -- from ERA (5.08) to batting average against (.286) to quality starts -- and from day one Kerrigan preached the importance of pitching inside and working ahead in the count.
But he also customized the game plan for each starter. Kerrigan suggested a mechanical adjustment that allowed Duke, a lefty, to pound the inner half of the plate with his fastball against right-handed hitters. He also suggested ways for Duke to maintain his focus so he could avoid the big innings that haunted him in 2008.
Ross Ohlendorf's mandate was to develop more consistency with his breaking ball. Ian Snell focused on changing speeds, and Jeff Karstens received a tweak to add deception to his delivery. As for Paul Maholm, he posted a 3.11 ERA after June, so there wasn't much room to nitpick.
Are the Pittsburgh starters going to perform at this level all season? Skepticism abounds. But with all the disappointment the Pirates have endured in building a staff, even a short-term mirage is welcome.
The Pirates have invested heavily in pitching through the draft over the past decade. But former first-round picks Clinton Johnston, Bobby Bradley, Bryan Bullington and John Van Benschoten are mere memories now, and Sean Burnett has a 6-7 career record as a Pirate and is now pitching in the team's bullpen.
Things looked promising two years ago when Tom Gorzelanny and Snell both posted sub-4.00 ERAs in 200-plus innings of work. But Snell has been a monument to inconsistency since then, and Gorzelanny was a disaster last season. He showed up at spring training out of shape and seemingly convinced that he had arrived, and the Pirates gave him a wake-up call with a demotion to Triple-A Indianapolis.
The Pirates say Gorzelanny has shown better commitment this year, but when he pitched poorly in the Grapefruit League, they sent him back to the International League with a directive to start pounding the strike zone with hard stuff instead of pitching "backwards'' and working off his changeup.
"We saw early signs in spring training he kind of went into that 'survival mode' again, so we decided we needed to take a drastic step to get him out of it,'' Huntington said. "To be truthful, we need this guy to be good again if we're going to get where we want to get. He's going to have to be an asset for us.''
When Gorzelanny returns -- and the Pirates expect him back at some point this season -- he'll join a group of pitchers who've endured their share of career setbacks and upheaval. Snell is an undersized former 26th-round pick, and Ohlendorf and Karstens both came over from the Yankees as part of the Xavier Nady-Damaso Marte trade in July.
Maholm, a first-round pick out of Mississippi State in 2003, suffered a broken nose and a fractured orbital bone around his right eye when he was hit by a line drive in 2004. In hindsight, Maholm now says it took him about three seasons to get completely comfortable with his delivery again. When reporters describe Maholm as reliable to the point of "boring,'' he takes it as a compliment.
Duke, 26, might have the most inspiring story of the group. When he posted an 8-2 record and a 1.81 ERA in 14 starts four years ago, he was anointed Pittsburgh's No. 1 prospect by Baseball America. But he discovered it wouldn't be that easy.
Duke has always thrown across his body -- a trait that's a harbinger for arm trouble in the estimation of many baseball people. When Colborn tinkered with his mechanics three years ago, Duke lost his release point and his confidence, in that order. He shut it down with a sore elbow in 2007, then posted an 8-22 record with a 5.08 ERA the next two seasons.
Although reports of a rift with Colborn were rampant in Pittsburgh, Duke chooses to keep any discontent to himself. He regards his three years in the wilderness as more a formative experience than something to regret.
"I know I learned some valuable lessons,'' Duke said. "The main thing for me was not giving up and folding. I kept my nose to the grindstone and I kept working through everything. I feel like now I can make it through whatever comes my way.''
This offseason, Duke left the Pittsburgh cold behind and returned home to the Fort Worth, Texas, area. He worked out with Blue Jays closer B.J. Ryan at the TMI Sports Performance Center, and reported to Bradenton, Fla., ready for a fresh start.
Like his fellow Pittsburgh starters, Duke has embraced the Kerrigan program with zeal. There's a lot of information to digest, but the young Pirates were hungry for direction. And Ohlendorf graduated from Princeton with a degree in operations research and financial engineering, so he's not about to be intimidated by a few charts and graphs.
"The guys have all bought in,'' Maholm said. "Whenever Joe says something, he has either stats or video or experience to back it up. That goes a long way with a lot of guys. He's a different bird, but he knows his stuff.''
The ability to make in-game adjustments is particularly important to the Pittsburgh staff because these guys aren't going to out-velocity anyone. The Pirates rank last in the majors with 5.39 strikeouts per nine innings, so they'll have to rely on a defense that's been upgraded by the addition of Nyjer Morgan in left field and Andy LaRoche at third base. Pittsburgh ranks first in the majors this year in Baseball Prospectus' defensive efficiency ratings after finishing 28th in 2008.
With Ryan Doumit out two months because of a broken wrist and Nate McLouth bothered by an oblique injury, the Pirates will have to win their share of 3-2 games to be more than a temporary feel-good story.
"Every year we go to spring training and it seems like there's a new pitching coach telling us how the program is going to go and trying to put his stamp on us,'' Maholm said. "It would be nice to get on a roll and hopefully have Joe around for a good while.''
Continuity in Pittsburgh. What a concept.

Like the definition of a good stimulus package or the guidelines for tipping your neighborhood Hooters waitress, plate discipline means different things to different people.
To the average fan, it's embodied by Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu, a hitter who's comfortable taking Strike 1 down the pipe and eyeballing pitch after pitch on the black. Your garden variety Abreu at-bat runs almost as long as "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."
For some Hall of Fame voters, Andre Dawson's meager walk totals are a rationale against induction to Cooperstown. Baseball writers love the Hawk's 400 homers, 300 stolen bases and eight Gold Gloves, but many refuse to cut him slack for that .323 career on-base percentage.
To Daniel Murphy, the Mets' young left fielder, plate discipline means having the willpower to say no regardless of how much his eyes say yes.
"Plate discipline for me is swinging at something that I'm looking for and I can hit," Murphy says. "For the most part, I like the pitch down, so I try not to swing at anything up until two strikes, because if I swing at that, then I'm out."
For Atlanta outfielder Jeff Francoeur, the search for a more disciplined approach is elusive and the source of occasional torment. Francoeur began this season with loose goals of 80 strikeouts and 50 to 60 walks. But he's always been an aggressive player, and he's wary of becoming too passive in the quest for a higher OBP.
"If on-base percentage is so important, then why don't they put it up on the scoreboard?" Francoeur says.
Hey, if they can post Ian Kinsler's OPS on ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball" with no further embellishment, that day might not be far off.
As managers obsess over pitchers' workloads and teams routinely carry staffs with 12 or even 13 arms, the 30 major league clubs continue to look for ways to drive up pitch counts and apply the pressure. One ultra-selective Albert Pujols or Kevin Youkilis in the middle of the order sets the tone, and the mindset becomes contagious.
That's nothing new. The long-term goal, as teams focus on grinding out at-bats to chase starters and expose weak bullpens, is finding the next wave of hitters who can get with the program. In baseball terms, it's the equivalent of automobile manufacturers' racing to build the best hybrid vehicle.
"There are a lot of player development people who continue to scratch their heads trying to come up with ideas about how their hitters can be more selective," says Keith Lieppman, the farm director for the Oakland A's. "It's continually evolving to this day."
Do scouting directors just look for players with proven pedigrees in the draft, or can teams feel free to select players with power, speed and other tools in anticipation that plate discipline can be taught to anyone with hand-eye coordination and the willingness to learn?
It's the old nature versus nurture debate. Is plate discipline a God-given skill, a learned behavior, or a combination of the two? And in the case of Francoeur, if you tinker forever, do you have a chance?
Contrary to the popular perception, life as we know it didn't begin with "Moneyball." The A's began preaching the value of on-base percentage way back in the 1980s, when general manager Sandy Alderson embraced the writings of Eric Walker, a former aerospace engineer who argued that offenses should be more concerned with avoiding outs than amassing base hits.


“

For me, plate discipline is being able to know what pitch you want to put in play before you step in the box and not swinging at anything else but that.
”

The A's instituted a teaching model that's been subject to constant trial and error over time. It permeates each level of their minor league system.
"I've been in this job 18 years, and I've gotten phone calls from people in other organizations who say, 'How do you guys teach that selectivity thing?'" Lieppman says. "I tell them, 'Have you got a couple of years?'"
Boston, Cleveland and San Diego are among the other organizations that stress plate discipline in the minors. If a young Red Sox hitter doesn't have a clue in Salem, Portland or Pawtucket, Fenway Park certainly isn't the place to learn. That's truer than ever now that technological advances in scouting allow teams to readily identify and exploit hitters' weaknesses.
"It's an incredibly difficult thing to teach at the major league level," says Red Sox assistant GM Ben Cherington. "There's pressure on players in terms of winning, keeping a job and earning money. It's hard to do at any level, but it's really hard at the major league level."
Boston's approach is centered on two building blocks. First, hitters are encouraged to approach an 0-0 count with the same mindset they have at 2-0 or 3-1. If they see a fastball in their zone, they're poised to climb all over it and drive it. If they don't see that pitch, they lay off, and it's either a ball or a strike they probably couldn't have done much with, anyway.
Boston's minor league instructors also stress the importance of a consistent two-strike approach. Generally, hitters like to widen out at the plate, choke up, let the ball travel deep in the zone and try to foul it off. Some hitters expand the zone from black to black. Others might look away, since that's where most pitchers try to finish off hitters, then adjust to anything inside.
One popular misconception is that teams such as Oakland and Boston bombard their young hitters with a directive to walk more and strike out less. Instead, those clubs preach the value of a sound approach, and believe the numbers will take care of themselves as a byproduct.
"We don't want guys to strike out, but I don't think a guy strikes out less by telling him to strike out less," Cherington says.
Says Lieppman: "We have a cycle that we pound into hitters' heads. It consists of the approach, the result, and then the response to what just happened. It's not about going up there trying to walk. It's about getting a good pitch to hit."
For several years, the A's tinkered with incentives to drum home the need for a disciplined approach at the plate. An Oakland prospect couldn't advance a rung in the minors or win an organizational award unless he walked in 10 percent of his plate appearances or posted an OBP of .350. But the Oakland development people eventually concluded that those markers were too rigid, and they dispensed with the standards.
Still, the A's continue to school their young hitters in the importance of focus and tuning out distractions. In rookie ball or Class A ball, hitters might be required to take a pitch or two in each at-bat. They participate in drills that teach them how to foul off tough pitches with two strikes. And if a hitter swings at a bad pitch in batting practice, he might receive a subtle reminder.
"There's a learning curve for hitters, and there are going to be some down cycles," Lieppman says. "As you teach people how to be selective, in many cases performance will go down and you'll see an increase in passivity for hitters. It's hard to be aggressive and patient and selective at the same time."
Cherington divides young hitters into three categories. The first consists of players who are "wired" to be selective and have the developmental background to be successful. Youkilis and Mark Teixeira embraced the concept of plate discipline in college, while Yonder Alonso, Cincinnati's first-round draft pick in 2008, was a polished hitter coming out of the University of Miami.
The second group consists of players who also might be wired for selectivity, but haven't been exposed to the philosophy enough to put it into practice. Orlando Hudson and Jose Reyes both made huge strides once they arrived in the majors. Cherington mentions Pittsburgh second baseman Freddy Sanchez, who's never been a big walker, but became more particular about swinging at strikes as a minor leaguer in the Boston chain.
The final grouping is made up of players who don't have the inclination to be selective. They're just not built that way. Corey Patterson, Brandon Phillips, Yuniesky Betancourt and (to this point) Francoeur are members of this fraternity.
There are no secrets these days. Inside Edge and other statistical services keep detailed information on which hitters are finicky and which swing freely, and who makes contact or swings at air. The FanGraphs Web site can tell you that only 9.3 percent of the pitches Toronto shortstop Marco Scutaro swings at are outside the strike zone, while Giants catcher Bengie Molina offers at a whopping 54 percent. Francoeur resides in the middle of the pack at 27.8 percent.
In many ways, Francoeur is racing to make up for lost time. As a terrific high school athlete in Atlanta, he had the gifts of a first-round draft pick with none of the refinement. He would stand on the plate, take a big metal-bat hack, and watch the ball fly.
Since his arrival in the majors in 2005, Francoeur has struggled to find an identity. He hit 29 homers in his first full season, but posted a .293 on-base percentage. Then he improved his OBP at the expense of his power. Last year he bulked up with an NFL-style conditioning program in an effort to hit more home runs, and everything unraveled.
One scout called him "the most confused hitter in the game" -- a label that Francoeur doesn't dispute. He's sensitive to the criticism of his free-swinging approach, and at times he's put excessive pressure on himself to remake himself as a hitter.
"People forget that I just turned 25," Francoeur says. "I've been up since I was 21, and a lot of people come up when they're 24 or 25.  I have 3½ years in the big leagues, but I'm still learning how to hit."
Francoeur spent a lot of time with teammate Chipper Jones in the cage over the winter and traveled to Texas to work with Rangers coach Rudy Jaramillo. Among other things, they stressed the impact that good or bad mechanics can have on plate discipline. In 2008, Francoeur's mechanics were such a mess that he had to cheat and start the bat early to have a prayer of hitting a fastball. That robbed him of precious milliseconds to better gauge what was coming.
Jones runs through the list of transgressions: Francoeur's head was moving, his bat was "wrapping," and he was long getting to the ball. In one-on-one sessions with Jaramillo, Francoeur picked up a couple of keys to remedy the problem. He now makes sure to get his hands back and his foot down once the pitcher raises his arm and is ready to deliver the ball. That way, he can better see the ball, and doesn't have to rush to get his hands in position.
"I think Frenchy will admit that he cannot continue along the same path he was headed down and be successful," Jones says. "When you're that much of a free swinger, it can only lead to bad things. How many times did you see him swing at a pitch in the dirt the first couple years of his career?"


“
We have a cycle that we pound into hitters' heads. It consists of the approach, the result, and then the response to what just happened. It's not about going up there trying to walk. It's about getting a good pitch to hit.
”

Francoeur's results so far this season are a mixed bag. He has only four walks and a .307 on-base percentage in his first 95 at-bats. But he's struck out a mere eight times, and he's hitting .440 with runners in scoring position. He thinks he's on his way to finding the proper balance between selective and aggressive.
"You don't go up there, as a hitter saying, 'I'm going to take some pitches,'" Francoeur says. "The moment you do, they're going to throw you two fastballs down the middle. If you're facing Tim Lincecum and you go up there trying to work into a hitter's count, you better not miss that fastball he throws -- because if you get behind 0-2, you're done."
Francoeur is fortunate to have access to a hitting oracle in Jones, whose .310 career batting average and six All-Star appearances give him the self-assurance to stick with a plan and rarely stray from it.
"For me, plate discipline is being able to know what pitch you want to put in play before you step in the box and not swinging at anything else but that," Jones says. "A lot of young hitters go up there and look for the first strike. They could be sitting on the fastball, but they still swing at the curveball.
"That's where young hitters make outs, whereas older hitters might sit on the fastball, then spit on the curveball, spit on the changeup and spit on the slider until they get that one fastball in the count. If you go up there with a game plan of knowing what pitch you want to put in play, it automatically makes you a much more selective hitter."
The Brewers have a young, relatively free-swinging lineup that's reliant on the long ball to score runs. So some players were perplexed last year when then-manager Ned Yost held a meeting in New York and told them they weren't drawing enough walks. Shortstop J.J. Hardy said the directive bred a sense of confusion and tentativeness.
"We didn't walk enough, so we had a meeting about needing to walk," Hardy says. "Guys were like, 'Really?' You look at it from our perspective. Guys would be up there trying to work a walk. Then they'd take a pitch down the middle and think, 'That could have been a home run.'"
Walk and strikeout totals can be deceiving barometers. Although Abreu has averaged 123 strikeouts per season, that's an inevitable byproduct of working deep counts. At the opposite end of the scale, lots of young players are so afraid of striking out that they swing at a pitcher's pitch early in the count simply to put the ball in play.
When Hardy was 18 years old and playing rookie ball, he struck out only 14 times in 166 plate appearances. In hindsight, he realizes it was because he was swinging from the moment he stepped in the box.
This year, Milwaukee outfielder Ryan Braun, a renowned free swinger, has already drawn 14 walks -- a third of his total for all of 2008. Is Braun more selective? Perhaps. But pitchers have also learned to tread lightly around Braun because of his career .584 slugging percentage. He's not going to see many strikes because his reputation precedes him.
It takes a rare player to learn the value of plate discipline under a microscope, but Reyes certainly applies. In 2005, Reyes drew 27 walks and struck out 78 times. Two years later, he drew 77 walks and struck out 78 times. In the course of his makeover, Reyes upgraded a .300 OBP to the .350 to .360 range annually.
The transformation is better achieved, of course, in the developmental chain. Nick Swisher, hailed in "Moneyball" as a polished offensive player coming out of Ohio State, took a big step forward with Oakland's Triple-A farm club in Sacramento in 2004, when he drew 103 walks and posted a .407 OBP. Swisher benefited from hours of work with coach Joe Sparks, who devised a drill in which he'd throw pitches and Swisher had to shout out "yes" or "no" before the ball reached the plate.
The general rule of thumb in baseball is that players need a foundation of 1,500 minor league at-bats before they graduate to the majors. But the A's use a different measuring stick. They track the total number of pitches seen, rather than simply count at-bats. It stands to reason that a hitter who averages 4.2 pitches for 1,500 plate appearances will be more advanced than someone who sees only 2.5.
"The more pitches hitters see, the more confident and mature they are," Lieppman said. "They're not panicked by a 2-2 sinker or a slider that's barely off the plate. They come to understand it's not a pitch to hit, or they foul it off. That's the level you're trying to get to."
In baseball's new age, even cultural stereotypes are taking a beating. Lieppman recently traveled to the Dominican Republic to visit Oakland's Latin-American academy, and he saw several youngsters making progress in the quest to exercise restraint at the plate.
The A's have no desire to suck the joy out of the game for their young Latin players, and they're not going to be finicky if they stumble upon the next Vladimir Guerrero. But they know there are only so many Vlads out there.
"Baseball people used to say, 'You can't walk your way off the island,'" Lieppman said. "We've changed that model to, 'You've got to be selective to get off the island.'"
These days, aspiring big leaguers from all backgrounds and locations would be advised to learn the same language. Brain-dead hackers need not apply.

Sure, Doug Melvin stood at the podium for that $252 million Alex Rodriguez signing in 2000 and pulled off the CC Sabathia blockbuster last summer. But the Milwaukee Brewers' general manager is more in his element making creative, under-the-radar deals than holding news conferences, and he prefers tapping the minor league system to raiding owner Mark Attanasio's bank account.
Melvin, a Chatham, Ontario, native, is very methodical and understated in his approach. Maybe it's a Canadian thing.
In December, after the Brewers failed to re-sign Sabathia, Melvin was close to trading outfielder Mike Cameron to the Yankees. But after careful consideration, he decided to exercise Cameron's $10 million option. Then he opted for fiscal restraint and signed free-agent starter Braden Looper for $4.75 million rather than overpaying for, say, Oliver Perez.
"At first we said, 'We have to go after some pitching,'" Melvin said. "Then we came to our senses and said, 'You don't want to be paying a pitcher $50 million if he's not worth that.' We figured the best way to improve our pitching on a day-to-day basis was to continue to have a center fielder who can play defense."
It's not quite the battle cry that's going to rally the populace for the winter caravan. But when you're playing .600 ball in late May, it'll fly.
Milwaukee is one of baseball's early success stories. Sabathia and Ben Sheets are gone, and Mike Maddux, one of baseball's most acclaimed pitching coaches, is bonding with the staff in Texas. Yet here are the Brewers, with their underpublicized rotation and a bullpen anchored by 41-year-old Trevor Hoffman, leading the National League Central at 27-18. That ties them with Boston for the second-best record in the majors.
After losing three straight in Minnesota this past weekend, the Brewers regained their footing on Memorial Day in one of the most entertaining games of the season. Starter Yovani Gallardo combined with Hoffman and Carlos Villanueva to throw 10 two-hit innings, and Bill Hall delivered a dramatic game-winning single to beat St. Louis 1-0.
The Brewers enter Tuesday night's game against the Cardinals with a 4.01 team ERA, seventh-best in the majors, and they're tied for second with 26 quality starts. Since opening the season at 4-9, they've posted a record of 23-9 -- best in the majors during that span.
Do the Brewers have staying power? According to the FanGraphs Web site, the Milwaukee pitching staff has yielded a batting average of .270 on balls in play -- the lowest in the majors. That would suggest the Brewers are in for a reality check once opposing hitters begin to find a few more holes.
But once the ball is on the ground or in the air, the Brewers are adept at catching it. Milwaukee leads the majors in Baseball Prospectus' defensive efficiency rankings, which measure the rate at which balls in play are converted into outs.
The Brewers' rotation includes two No. 5-type veterans in Jeff Suppan and Looper and an underrated strike-throwing machine in David Bush, whose 1.14 WHIP last year was ninth-best in the majors. For point of reference, Johan Santana ranked 10th at 1.15.
The best pure stuff on the staff belongs to Gallardo and Manny Parra, and they're both still learning. As wondrous as Gallardo can be, his location tends to wander when he overthrows. That has been the case in his two clunkers this season against Houston and Cincinnati.
"I don't think we have a guy that sticks right out and you say, 'That's your No. 1 guy going out there today,'" Brewers manager Ken Macha said. "Even though people are going to be pointing at Gallardo to do that, I don't think he's there yet. In time, that could happen."
Although Maddux is receiving a great deal of credit for the pitching staff's resurgence in Texas, the Brewers have quickly warmed to his successor, Bill Castro.
Castro, 57, was a reliever for the Brewers and two other clubs for 10 seasons in the 1970s and '80s. He spent 17 years as bullpen coach in Milwaukee under Phil Garner, Jim Lefebvre, Davey Lopes, Jerry Royster and Ned Yost before getting his big opportunity.
Bullpen coaches put in long hours, but they're generally perceived as the guys who tote the sunflower seeds and bubble gum to the 'pen and answer the phone when it's time for somebody to get warm. For all the public knows, they might even be calling for pizza delivery.
But with staffs now routinely carrying seven or eight relievers who share a confined space for three hours at a stretch, the bullpen coach needs to be part mechanic, part advance scout and part cheerleader and grief counselor. Melvin always has advocated having a pitcher as bullpen coach, even as some organizations choose to give the job to former catchers.
"It's an underrated position," Melvin said. "It's somewhat similar to the first-base coach. People think the first-base coach is just a helmet picker-upper, but he's the guy who keeps the runners alert over there. It's the same with bullpen coaches. The pitching coach gets credit if the bullpen goes well, and not the bullpen coach. That's unfair."
For many years, Castro aspired to the job of pitching coach, but he had reason to wonder whether he had been typecast.
"A lot of people told me, 'I can't believe you've been there that long and you haven't gotten a chance to be a pitching coach,'" Castro said. "I think one reason is I don't know many people outside the organization, because I've been here such a long time. And I'm not a self-promoter type of guy. I always believed if you do your job, somebody will recognize you down the line."
Luckily for Castro, Milwaukee's new manager was the open-minded sort. Macha, a former catcher, spent five years as bullpen coach in Montreal and was receptive to the idea of promoting from within.
Castro traveled to Macha's home in Pittsburgh during the winter for his interview, and the two men exchanged ideas and shared philosophies. Among other things, Macha came to realize the strong rapport Castro had developed with the Milwaukee staff. That helped seal the deal.
"We had a three-hour lunch," Macha said. "I probably didn't give a big enough tip to the girl who was waiting on our table."
Castro might have felt a bit overwhelmed during spring training when Milwaukee had 28 pitchers in camp. Then the bad news hit. The Brewers released Eric Gagne in March, and David Riske, counted on to provide stability as a set-up man, went down with elbow problems in April. He's currently trying to return in extended spring training in Arizona.
In April, Milwaukee's staff led the majors in hit batsmen and ranked sixth in walks. But in May, the Brewers rank in the middle of the pack in HBPs and are 25th in walks. That's vital for a group that has its share of finesse pitchers and second-chance types.
The bullpen has Melvin's fingerprints all over it. The Brewers acquired Villanueva in a minor league trade four years ago. Mitch Stetter signed for a $1,000 bonus out of the draft. Todd Coffey was a waiver claim, and Mark DiFelice pitched two years of independent ball in the Atlantic League.
And of course there's Hoffman, who's yet to allow a run or a walk in 13 innings this season. His performance Monday was typical; he set down the Cardinals 1-2-3 on seven pitches -- none of which surpassed 86 mph.
If the Brewers plan to lean more on the offense as the season progresses, they might be disappointed. They generate 40.2 percent of their runs through the home run ball -- the sixth-highest rate in the majors -- and can be challenged to score when Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder aren't going deep. The loss of Rickie Weeks to season-ending wrist surgery also could be a major hit. Right now, the Brewers plan to go with a combination of Craig Counsell and Casey McGehee at second base, while prospect Alcides Escobar takes a crash course in the position in the minors.
When asked whether the Brewers might make a play for Jake Peavy or whether that's mere speculation, Melvin replied with characteristic candor.
"That's just people throwing stuff out there," he said.
Rest assured that no matter what he says, Melvin will find a way to adapt to changing circumstances. They're pretty good at Plan B's in Milwaukee.

Atlanta manager Bobby Cox sat in the home dugout at Turner Field before Monday's season opener, puffed on a cigar and mixed in some general ball talk amid reminiscences about Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams. At one point, the conversation turned to the dynamic, young African-American outfielder who's making such a positive impression on fans, opponents and scouts throughout the National League.
Yes, that Andrew McCutchen kid certainly can play.
"He's an All-Star. This year, probably," Cox said. "Hitting. Running. Defense. Throwing. He's got it all. He catches the ball like Andruw Jones did when he was 19. You can't hit a ball [past him] out there. He's got lightning in that bat too."
McCutchen, Pittsburgh's center fielder and No. 2 hitter, will not elicit many comparisons to hotshot Braves rookie Jason Heyward. He hits from the right side, rather than the left, and is listed at a scant 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, in contrast to Heyward's imposing 6-5, 240.


“
He's so damn quick, it's amazing. It looks like he's just floating through the air.
”

And unlike Heyward, McCutchen can expect to spend most of this season in a publicity-free zone. National media outlets rarely pass through the Pirates' clubhouse, if only because the storyline is so old, tiresome and painful to rehash for all involved. The Pirates haven't had a winning season since 1992, when Andy Van Slyke played center field and Jay Bell hit second in the order, and it doesn't matter that McCutchen was 6 years old at the time.
He's a Pirate; therefore, he gets asked.
"If people want to put that on us, let them put it on us," McCutchen said. "We don't put it on ourselves. We don't dwell on what happened in the past, because the past is the past and you can't change that. We want to be a team that wins. That's the only thing going on with us right now."
In casual conversation, McCutchen conveys an air of thoughtfulness and inward calm. His father, Lorenzo, is a youth minister who taught him the importance of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of obstacles. McCutchen turned down a baseball scholarship from the University of Florida to sign with Pittsburgh as the 11th overall pick in the 2005 draft -- right between fellow high school outfielders Cameron Maybin and Jay Bruce -- and newspaper personality profiles duly noted his fondness for writing poetry, drawing and singing in the church choir.
In his mini-biography in the Pirates' media guide, McCutchen reveals that his first job was as a custodian at a bank, he's a fan of Lil Wayne and the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," and the person he would most like to meet, dead or alive, is Eddie Murphy.
Judging from his rookie season, McCutchen is more inclined toward drama than comedy. After the Pirates traded center fielder Nate McLouth to Atlanta in a deal that made fans want to raze PNC Park, management summoned McCutchen from Triple-A Indianapolis in early June. All McCutchen did was single against the Mets' Mike Pelfrey in his first at-bat and go 2-for-4 with three runs scored, a walk, an RBI and a stolen base in an 11-6 Pittsburgh victory.
Before the year was through, there were plenty of highlights to savor. McCutchen led NL rookies with 47 extra-base hits and 10 outfield assists. He homered three times in a win over Washington, and became the first Pirates rookie since Richie Zisk of the 1973 club to accumulate three hitting streaks of 10 games or more.
He also avoided anything resembling a major rough patch. McCutchen hit .284 in June, .277 in July, .304 in August and .281 in September and October. He racked up 20 infield hits, and found a way to reach base even when he was fooled or his swing was out of sync.
"He wasn't awed by the big leagues," Pirates catcher Ryan Doumit said. "He was up for four months, and there was never a time where he struggled for an extended period. He didn't play like a rookie. He played like a 10-year veteran."
McCutchen spent the winter training with his friend Will Cherry, a former Florida Southern outfielder who's now a minor leaguer in the Mets' chain, with a focus on cardio work and strengthening his legs. Some things remain constant: During a recent interview, McCutchen wore a gray Pirates T-shirt with the inscription "We > Me" on the back. General manager Neal Huntington cites two examples to illustrate how McCutchen embodies that team-oriented slogan.
The first came in the fall of 2008, when the Pirates sent McCutchen to the instructional league with a mandate to improve his bunting, work on his base-stealing reads and breaks, and refine his reads, routes, angles and throwing in the outfield. It would have been easy for McCutchen to do his work, return to the hotel and call it a night, but he immersed himself in the camp dynamic.
"He kind of took over the camp, and was a great leader for our young guys," Huntington said. "We would have been fine with him partaking of his own program, but he joined the program."
The second example came Aug. 25 against the Phillies. With the score tied 4-4 and teammate Brandon Moss on second base, McCutchen stepped to the plate against Brad Lidge looking to advance the runner.  After misplaying a Shane Victorino line drive into a triple in the top of the ninth inning, McCutchen half-wondered if the team might flash him a bunt sign. Instead, he drove a 93 mph fastball over the right-center-field fence for a two-run, walk-off homer to give Pittsburgh a 6-4 victory.
"It was the perfect at-bat," Huntington said. "He did the right thing mechanically and mentally, and he mis-hit the ball and won the game with a home run. That sounds silly to say, but he was trying to hit a line drive to the gap, and he was under it by a shade and it left the ballpark."
McCutchen's cachet, or "it" factor, isn't confined to his grace in center field or his ability to drive the ball. He ranks with Michael Bourn, Carl Crawford and Emilio Bonifacio among a small fraternity of big league burners, and the sense of anticipation in the stands builds as he rounds the first-base bag, legs churning and dreadlocks flying, with third base in his sights. He's a triples machine and a 20-homer, 40-stolen base threat in waiting.
"He's so damn quick, it's amazing," Pirates outfielder Ryan Church said. "It looks like he's just floating through the air."
How fast can McCutchen run with 17 years of organizational anguish on his back? The plan is to surround him with help as quickly as possible, but as usual, the Pirates are asking their fan base to be patient. Former top pick Pedro Alvarez, one of baseball's elite young hitters, should be up by June. Catcher Tony Sanchez and pitcher Brad Lincoln look like solid major leaguers, and former Yankees prospect Jose Tabata has a chance to be good amid questions about his age and lack of power for a corner outfielder.
It might be easier for the Pittsburgh faithful to embrace the team's long-range thinking if the return haul for Jason Bay, McLouth, Freddy Sanchez, Xavier Nady, Jack Wilson and Nyjer Morgan weren't so iffy. Ross Ohlendorf and Charlie Morton are part of the Pittsburgh rotation, but Craig Hansen is hurt, Moss was just outrighted to Triple-A and Lastings Milledge, Andy LaRoche, Jeff Clement, Ronny Cedeno, Tim Alderson, Gorkys Hernandez, Jeff Locke, Bryan Morris & Co. seem more like complementary pieces than high-upside guys.
The Pirates have spent a major league-high $18.7 million on the draft the last two years, so they're hoping to do more than just recycle mediocrity. Current and former Pirates alike think it's unfair to heap expectations on McCutchen as the savior who will lead the team out of the NL Central wilderness.
"I don't think there's any one person that can turn a situation like that around," McLouth said. "He's obviously a good player, but it's unrealistic to place it on one person's shoulders. It has to be an effort of a whole minor league system."
Will the Pirates make strides this year and escape last place for only the second time since 2005? Or are they destined for a sixth consecutive sub-70-win season, and a fresh round of Zach Duke-Paul Maholm-Ryan Doumit trade speculation in July?
"In order to be better, you should expect to be better," McCutchen said. "We have a better team than we did last year, just because we don't have to worry about who's getting traded and who's not going to be here."
At 23, the face of the Pittsburgh franchise is talented, resolute and determined to improve each day. It doesn't take an authority on outfield play -- or Bobby Cox -- to be excited about what the future has in store.

Joe Mauer might be the perfect Minnesota Twin, but he's also a freak of nature -- at least until polite, humble, 6-foot-5, .330-hitting catchers with great sideburns start coming along more than once a century.
If you're looking for a player who better embodies the franchise's core philosophy, think more along the lines of a pitcher with an even temperament, middling velocity and the ability to decapitate a fly from a distance of 60 feet, 6 inches.
Think Brad Radke.
The old Carl Pohlad Twins have gone through a transitional period in recent years. Torii Hunter and Johan Santana left town. The Twins finally ditched their domed stadium, and their Opening Day payroll of $97.5 million ranked 11th among the 30 big league clubs -- ahead of the Dodgers, Cardinals and Braves.
But some things never change in Minnesota, regardless of payroll size or ballpark environs. The Twins play fundamentally sound defense, run the bases with aplomb, believe in old-fashioned concepts like "teamwork'' and "accountability'' and place tremendous stock in continuity.
And if the pitching staff ever walks two batters in a row, it's time for manager Ron Gardenhire to call a team meeting.
Through 38 games this season, Minnesota's pitchers have allowed 90 walks -- easily the fewest in the majors. In contrast to the New York Mets, who've walked a staggering 175 batters, the Twins live in a world where the pace is brisk, umpire Joe West has time to catch a late meal, and defenders are always on their toes.
If there's a team well-suited to play its home games at Target Field, it's this one.
"It's funny,'' said right fielder Michael Cuddyer. "If you're in the field and one of our pitchers loses a little bit of control, you start getting frustrated. You realize how spoiled we are with guys throwing strikes and not walking people. When we have 3½-hour games, we're dog tired, because we're not used to it.''
You have to go back to the 1996 Twins staff, which had Rich Robertson and Frankie Rodriguez in the starting rotation, to find a Minnesota team that didn't rank among the game's top five in fewest walks allowed. In nine of the past 13 seasons, the Twins have ranked first or second in that category.
The phenomenon has encompassed Eric Milton, Mark Redman, Joe Mays, Rick Reed, Santana and Carlos Silva, through the current rotation of Francisco Liriano, Scott Baker, Carl Pavano, Kevin Slowey and Nick Blackburn. Bob Tewksbury dropped in for a cameo, and LaTroy Hawkins displayed fine control as both a starter and a reliever.
And of course, there's Radke, whose ratio of 1.63 walks per nine innings ranks 32nd in baseball history. For sake of comparison, Robin Roberts is 45th, Old Hoss Radbourn is 46th and Greg Maddux ranks 50th.
"He's sort of the godfather of our pitching approach,'' said Mike Radcliff, Minnesota's longtime scouting director.
The strike-throwing culture permeates every level of the Minnesota organization. It begins with the team's amateur scouts, who are instructed to look for the attributes that foster good control, and continues in the minor leagues, where pitching to contact is repeatedly encouraged.
"As soon as you put on a Twins uniform as a pitcher or a catcher, you go after hitters,'' Mauer said. "Try to throw strikes and use your defense. That's instilled in you right when you step in a minor league clubhouse.''
It's not easy to project how an 18-year-old high school senior's control will look when he's 24, but Twins scouts focus on the traits that will give a prospect a head start. The pitcher who maintains the same arm slot, breaks his hands at the same place and drops his landing foot in the same spot after each throw has an edge over someone with an inconsistent delivery. Similarly, a pitcher with the self-assurance to pitch to contact and the demeanor to shrug off a bad-hop single or adjust to a tight strike zone is a better fit for the organizational approach. Makeup is just as important as mechanics or stuff.
"We emphasize it at the acquisition level,'' Radcliff said. "It stems from a manifesto we put together way back in the day: As a small-market club, how are you going to get an edge? We believe that command and control and makeup are true separators in the pitching category.
"We put stock in it and believe that it matters. It's a part of our DNA now at every level -- from scouting through our player development to the big leagues.''
No one embodies Twins-think more than Slowey, one of the game's more cerebral pitchers. Slowey scored a 1420 on his SATs at Upper St. Clair High School in Pennsylvania, but topped out at 84 mph on the radar gun and didn't emerge as a prospect until gaining arm strength as a sophomore and junior at Winthrop University. The Twins picked Slowey in the second round of the 2005 draft, and he posted a strikeout-walk ratio of 361-52 in the minors before graduating to the big club.
Slowey has averaged 1.56 walks per nine innings in Minnesota -- out Radke-ing Radke. On June 17, 2007, he walked Milwaukee's Prince Fielder and Bill Hall back-to-back, and found the experience so harrowing that he's yet to repeat it.
The next time Slowey walks a hitter with the bases loaded, it will be a career first. He's so precise with his repertoire, pitching coach Rick Anderson occasionally has to remind him to throw a ball above the letters just to give hitters a different look. Think Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen ever does that with Oliver Perez?
"Slowey is like Radke. He's a freak,'' Radcliff said.  "He keeps pounding it in there and guys keep fouling it off, so he has to do different things to mix things up. You can almost see him out there thinking, 'I have to throw a ball here.' That's hard for him to do.''
Slowey and Minnesota's other young starters honed their control with help from Rick Knapp, who spent 12 years as the Twins' minor league pitching coordinator before joining Jim Leyland's staff in Detroit in 2009. Knapp, a patient teacher and innovative thinker, brought a full-length mirror to the park so that pitchers could better monitor their deliveries, and fashioned balance beams and other makeshift tools to help pitchers refine their command. He's applied those same principles to a hard-throwing staff in Detroit, and the Tigers have quickly reduced their walk totals on his watch.
Eric Rasmussen replaced Knapp as Minnesota's minor league coordinator, but the mindset hasn't changed. The Twins keep track of first-pitch strikes and balls thrown to the "four spot,'' down and away to a right-handed hitter. Pitchers who exhibit the best control over the span of a month or a year might get a free dinner as a reward. "There's a carrot out there,'' Radcliff said.
Anderson, Minnesota's pitching coach since 2002, is big on simplicity. He likes the minor league catchers to refrain from moving around a lot so that young pitchers have a stationary target. Minnesota's starters throw off a mound frequently between outings, even for 10-12 pitches, to help stay sharp. Twins pitchers also focus on keeping the ball low and down the middle, with the understanding that natural movement and variations in deliveries will carry it away from the heart of the plate.
"If you try to go right to the corner and just miss, everybody is like, 'Wow, great pitch. Ball 1,''' Anderson said. "If you go to the middle and just miss, it's on the corner. Strike 1. We always say, 'Let the err of the arm and the movement of the ball take it to the corners.'''


“
It stems from a manifesto we put together way back in the day: As a small-market club, how are you going to get an edge? We believe that command and control and makeup are true separators in the pitching category.
”

The same rules and expectations apply to both starters and relievers. Anderson has worked with Minnesota's core group for a while now, and if a pitcher's mechanics are slightly out of whack, he'll deliver a reminder before it mushrooms into a bigger problem.
"Talk to any pitcher who's ever had Andy, and they'll tell you, 'He's the best,''' Slowey said. "He knows how we throw, he knows what makes us work, and he's willing to take the time to help us individually. He's out there for hours on end with us.''
Cooperation from the front office is the final piece to the equation. General manager Bill Smith and his predecessor, Terry Ryan, have made a point of acquiring sure-handed defenders, because it's hard to ask a pitcher to induce contact if no one in the field can catch the ball. Four-time Gold Glove second baseman Orlando Hudson and steady shortstop J.J. Hardy are the latest additions to the mix.
If there's a downside to the approach, it's that Minnesota's reliance on command-and-control, finesse pitchers might not work as well in October, when hitters' bats are slower and power pitchers have the advantage. But that's a question for another day.
The Twins' philosophy certainly wears well over a 162-game season. More strikes mean lower pitch counts, which allow starters to go deeper into games and reduce the strain on a bullpen.
Hudson, the irrepressible O-Dog, was asked if it's fun to play behind pitchers who are so adept at throwing strikes. On the spectrum of obvious questions, that's like asking if Joe Mauer can hit.
"Who wants to stand in the field and watch people walk the ballpark?'' Hudson said. "Nobody I know.''

PHILADELPHIA -- Roy Oswalt grew up in tiny Weir, Miss., so there's a perception that Philadelphia might be a little fast-paced for his tastes.
This is probably true. Even the Mississippi version of Philadelphia (population 39,350) is a little city-fied for Oswalt.
Arizona reliever Chad Qualls, a former teammate of Oswalt's in Houston, joked Thursday that he never talks to Oswalt in the offseason because "I don't think he gets cell phone reception at his house."
But when it's late July and a pennant race beckons, a man puts aside his personal comfort zone and goes where the competition is.
If Oswalt had any concerns about uprooting his family and coming to Philadelphia to play in a hitter's park in one of the game's more demanding markets, they were alleviated by former Houston teammate Brad Lidge. The two spoke by phone for about 20 minutes Wednesday night, and Lidge did his best sales job. He told Oswalt about the sellout crowds at Citizen's Bank Park, the city's fervor for baseball and the organization's steadfast commitment to winning.
The Philadelphia skyline might be a departure for Oswalt after 9½ seasons in Houston, but Lidge can testify that the view looks pretty sweet from the back of a parade float.
"Roy's been with one franchise his whole career, so he wanted to know a little bit about Philadelphia and the city," Lidge said. "I told him that since I've been here, it's been one of the most unbelievable things I've ever seen. It doesn't take a genius to see what we've done and what we're doing here. This is where you want to be if you want a ring.
"He wants to win. And Philadelphia pretty much sells itself right now."
The Phillies, who've appeared in two straight World Series and sold out 91 consecutive home games, threw another bouquet to their fans when they acquired Oswalt for pitcher J.A. Happ and minor leaguers Anthony Gose and Jonathan Villar. The prospect of facing Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels and Oswalt might be daunting to Philadelphia's potential postseason opponents, but Thursday's move sent a jolt through the Phillies' clubhouse and the Citizen's Bank Park press box, where scouts gathered for the Phillies-Diamondbacks series finale.
"It's like a meat grinder facing that rotation right now," said a National League scout.
It's often said that deadline trades can be valuable for the message they send as well as the talent they bring, and the Oswalt trade is no exception. This hasn't been the smoothest season in Philadelphia, with all the injuries and unexpected offensive issues. But general manager Ruben Amaro Jr., with the approval of ownership, sent a signal that the organization is going to make every effort to give the team a chance to play deep into October.
In recent years, the Phillies have been a monument to activity at the non-waiver trade deadline. They've acquired Cliff Lee, Kyle Lohse, Joe Blanton and Jamie Moyer in July over the past four summers. And now there's Oswalt, whose 3.24 career ERA is second-best to Johan Santana among active big league starters. Oswalt's .635 winning percentage is seventh-best behind Santana, Tim Hudson, Halladay, Lee, CC Sabathia and Andy Pettitte.
"To me that's the biggest thing, coming from a team [in Toronto] where we weren't able to do things like this," Halladay said. "To get to this point in the season and get one of the best pitchers out there -- it says a lot. Obviously this team is dedicated to winning and they're not going to rest.''
Oswalt is quiet by nature and physically unimposing at 6-0, 190 pounds, but he likes the big stage. He overcame the "short right-hander" stigma in Houston and developed into an All-Star after being chosen out of Holmes Community College in the 23rd round of the 1996 draft. He pitched for a gold medal-winning U.S. squad in the 2000 Olympic Summer Games, and posted a 4-0 record with a 3.66 ERA in eight postseason appearances with the Astros in 2004 and 2005.
"We're getting a big-game pitcher. That's what I keep telling people," Lidge said. "I played with him for a while in Houston, and he was at his best in the most important games."


“

It doesn't take a genius to see what we've done and what we're doing here. This is where you want to be if you want a ring.
”

Houston owner Drayton McLane promised to buy Oswalt a bulldozer if he beat St. Louis in Game 6 of the 2005 National League Championship Series. After Oswalt threw seven effective innings to defeat the Cardinals in the pennant clincher, McLane shelled out $200,000 for a Caterpillar D6N XL, and had it delivered to Minute Maid Park with a red bow on top. Now Oswalt uses the bulldozer to build roads on his 1,000-acre ranch in Weir.
In recent years, the Phillies have fared better than most National League opponents against Oswalt. Ryan Howard (8-for-22, .364) and Jimmy Rollins (10-for-34. 294) both hit him well, and Placido Polanco has teed off on him to the tune of 10-for-23, .435. Of the Phillies' main lineup cogs, Chase Utley (4-for-23, .174) is the only laggard against Oswalt.
There are some concerns about Oswalt's back, and it's prompted front-office people and those close to him to wonder how many years he'll continue to pitch. But as long as there's a lineup to be faced and a game on the line, it doesn't matter how many stoplights and paved roads there are in his hometown.
"Philly is a big city and Roy is kind of a country boy, so he might not fit in that way," Qualls said. "But as far as the baseball aspect, that's going to outweigh everything. He's kind of quiet, but when you want somebody to step up in a big game and go out there and compete and be a gamer, he's definitely a guy you want on the mound with the ball in his hand."
Just a few years ago, people in Philadelphia poked fun at Charlie Manuel's Southern-fried diction and called him "Elmer Befuddled." That was right before he brought a world championship to the city and ascended to civic treasure status.
"You say he comes from a small town?" Manuel said of Oswalt. "Well, then him and I will get along pretty good, won't we?"

Baseball has a funny way of throwing perceptions for a curve. Just consider recent events involving the two teams in the Bay Area.
San Francisco general manager Brian Sabean, routinely vilified as a grump and a guy who gives out overpriced contracts, just rode in a parade celebrating the franchise's first championship since 1954. Meanwhile, Billy Beane, a charismatic, progressive thinker and media favorite whose team has won one playoff series in his 13 seasons as Oakland GM, will be portrayed by Brad Pitt next fall in the movie version of Michael Lewis' best-seller "Moneyball."
Miguel Tejada, one of the Oakland players featured in the movie, was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. For the role of Tejada, the filmmakers cast Royce Clayton, a Burbank, Calif., native who grew up in Inglewood and speaks just enough Spanish to be dangerous.
Clayton, 40, retired from Major League Baseball in 2008 after 17 seasons with the Giants, Cardinals, Rangers and eight other clubs. He learned of the "Moneyball" casting call from a friend in the movie business, auditioned at the Sony Studios in Los Angeles in June, and showed enough acting chops to land the role of the irrepressible "Miggy."


“
It's definitely not all glamour and glitz like people think it is. We'd have a 6 p.m. call time, and three days later you'd get a 6 a.m call time and totally switch your clock. It's tough. I definitely have an appreciation now for what these guys do -- their talent and their craft."
”

Then came the biggest challenge: How to play Tejada with the requisite authenticity. Clayton poured himself into the part, and spent several weeks cultivating a Spanish accent in an attempt to make the character believable.
"The guys found it hilarious," Clayton said. "I'd come in every day for two months saying, 'Hey you guys. We gonna win to-day!' and all this other good stuff in the same [Latin] accent."
Clayton performed the shtick everywhere, from the ball field to a scene with Pitt as Beane in the trainer's room. Then one day he was shooting a scene with Stephen Bishop, the actor who plays former Athletics outfielder David Justice. As the Justice character stands in front of a Coke machine trying to determine why the soft drinks aren't free, Tejada walks by and tells him, "Hey, welcome to Oakland. You gotta pay a dollar."
Bishop and Clayton read their lines again and again, trying to get it right, when director Bennett Miller finally intervened.
"Bennett comes over and says, 'Just drop the accent. It's good, but let's do it without it so your personality comes out,'" Clayton said. "I did it without it and he loved it, so there went my accent. I just spoke naturally for the rest of the movie, and it felt more comfortable, to tell you the truth."
It remains to be seen if Clayton will make audiences forget Keith Hernandez in "Seinfeld," Reggie Jackson in "Mr. Belvedere" or Bucky Dent in the "Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders" movie. But he did get a rare opportunity to double his pleasure: If it's true that actors aspire to be ballplayers and ballplayers dream of being in the movies, Clayton is one of the fortunate few with an understanding of how both sides live.
In his 11 big league stops, Clayton accumulated 1,904 hits and 231 stolen bases at shortstop. Then the free-agent winter of 2007-2008 came and went with no offers, and he felt the inevitable pangs of regret over watching his playing career come to an end. It wasn't until late March of 2008, when Clayton was playing golf with Kenny Lofton in Ronnie Lott's charity tournament at Pebble Beach, that he basked in the surroundings and decided his new life wasn't so bad.
Unlike many big leaguers, Clayton was well-prepared for life after baseball. He became an investor and advisory board member for Goldwater Bank, a private bank in Arizona, and dabbled in real estate before the market went south.
Now Clayton is taking a stab at the music business. He has started a company called Tema Entertainment that helped lay the groundwork for "Here Comes the Freak," a Tim Lincecum theme song that aired on Fox during the pitcher's Game 5 World Series appearance. Clayton is hoping to expand the concept and partner new, undiscovered musical acts with baseball players looking to further establish their "brand."
"There are very few situations where sports and entertainment can come together and monetize each other," Clayton said. "This is a win-win for everybody. It's a win for the group trying to get exposure, and a win for the player, who is recognizable and has millions of fans and now has a song associated with his brand and his name."
"Moneyball" isn't Clayton's first foray into cinema. In the 2002 Disney film "The Rookie," which chronicles pitcher Jim Morris' improbable journey from Texas high school science teacher to Tampa Bay Devil Rays reliever, Texas shortstop Royce Clayton strikes out in a climactic scene at the end of the movie. The Internet Movie Database says that Clayton played himself in an uncredited role. In reality, Clayton spent some time on the set, but was portrayed by an actor whose name he can't recall.
"He took some of the worst hacks I've ever seen," Clayton said. "I was like, 'How hard would it have been to find somebody who had actually swung a bat before?'"
Although readers of Lewis' book might wonder how well "Moneyball" will translate to the big screen, the picture boasts an all-star cast. It features Pitt as Beane; Philip Seymour Hoffman as Oakland manager Art Howe; Robin Wright as "Sharon," Beane's ex-wife; and Jonah Hill of "Knocked Up" and "Superbad" fame as Peter Brand, the A's resident computer whiz. Paul DePodesta, the real-life Peter Brand, asked to have his name removed from the film.
Clayton testifies to the authenticity of the baseball scenes -- right down to the double plays he turns with actor Brent Dohling, who plays second baseman Mark Ellis in the movie. Although Clayton has yet to speak directly with Tejada, he told Baltimore second baseman Brian Roberts, a mutual friend, to let Tejada know that he would do his best to portray him as accurately as possible.
Clayton, who's married with four children (a 6-year-old son, Royce Jr., and 5-year-old triplets), routinely came home during the several months of shooting and heard the question, "Is your movie ready yet, Daddy?" That question helped amplify the difference between the instant gratification of baseball and the long-haul grind of doing a film. Albert Pujols and Brad Pitt dwell in completely different realms.
"In my sport, you make a good play and see thousands of people go crazy," Clayton said. "For actors, there's very little fanfare when you're shooting a movie. It's tedious work. You sit around for long hours, and if you're a main guy, you know the results of that movie pretty much hinge on your performance.
"It's definitely not all glamour and glitz like people think it is. We'd have a 6 p.m. call time, and three days later you'd get a 6 a.m call time and totally switch your clock. It's tough. I definitely have an appreciation now for what these guys do -- their talent and their craft."
The cast of "Moneyball" celebrated the end of filming with a wrap party in October, and the movie is scheduled for release in 2011. Sometime next fall, the actor known on-screen as Miguel Tejada will walk the red carpet at the premiere. He'll leave his cleats and his Latin accent at home.
"Everybody keeps telling me, 'When you go up on the big screen, you're literally on 'The Big Screen,"' Clayton said. "It's bigger than life. I'm looking forward to that moment and just having fun with it. I wouldn't miss it for the world."

In a magazine interview nine years ago, Randy Johnson provided an insightful glimpse into the life lessons that make him tick. He revealed how it felt to be a gangly 6-foot-8, 180-pound teenager, and how the challenge of blending in socially helped shape his personality.
"It's hard to mix with a crowd when you're walking down the hallway and everybody else is a foot shorter," Johnson told Guideposts for Kids. "I remember hanging out with my friends, like at the mall, and thinking people were staring at me and talking about me. It made me turn inside myself. I became more shy and quiet."
If Johnson's goal was go through life unnoticed, he picked the wrong line of work.
Pitchers are accustomed to being the center of attention, and that's especially true for Johnson. Since his rookie year with Montreal in 1988, he has thrown harder and stood taller -- literally and figuratively -- than anybody in the majors.
Now 45, Johnson ranks second to Nolan Ryan on Major League Baseball's career list with 4,843 strikeouts. He's a 10-time All-Star and a five-time Cy Young Award winner. And on Wednesday night at Nationals Park in Washington, he will try to become the 24th member of the 300-win club.
In recognition of Johnson's run at 300, this week's edition of Starting 9 relives the nine most memorable moments -- good and bad -- in the Big Unit's career. If he can beat the Nationals, they'll all slide down a notch.

Fourteen years after Johnson threw a no-hitter for Seattle against Detroit, he became the oldest pitcher to record a perfect game. Johnson was four months shy of his 41st birthday when he dazzled the Braves in a 2-0 Arizona victory at Turner Field.
Johnson also joined Cy Young, Jim Bunning, Nolan Ryan and Hideo Nomo as one of only five pitchers to throw a no-hitter in each league.
Johnson overpowered an Atlanta lineup that was missing double-play partners Rafael Furcal and Marcus Giles, but still included Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones. He induced 28 swings and misses, threw 87 of 117 pitches for strikes, and clocked 98 mph on the radar gun with his final pitch.
The most enduring moment came during the celebration. After Johnson whiffed Eddie Perez to end the game, he pumped his fist and prepared to shake hands with catcher Robby Hammock. But Hammock, caught up in the emotion, began jumping up and down like a little kid, prompting Johnson to break out in a huge smile. A scrum soon followed.
Later in the Diamondbacks' road trip, in Florida, Hammock received an engraved Rolex watch from Johnson to commemorate their big night.
It was only the 56th major league game for Hammock and the undisputed highlight of his career. Hammock is now 32 years old and playing for Baltimore's Triple-A team in Norfolk, Va., where he spent April and May backing up mega-prospect Matt Wieters.

A select few left-handed batters had the talent and fortitude to fare well against Johnson. Don Mattingly batted .381 (16-for-42) against the Big Unit. Barry Bonds hit .306 in 42 at-bats, and Mo Vaughn, Shawn Green and Todd Helton all held their own.
Then there were guys like Rafael Palmeiro (1-for-21, .048) who had no hope, and an army of lefty hitters who came down with head colds and stiff necks when Johnson took the mound. Harold Baines and George Brett were among the prominent lefty hitters who were less than enthused about stepping in the box against the Big Unit.
At the 1993 All-Star Game in Baltimore, John Kruk took the bullet for "Randy Johnson-itis" sufferers everywhere.
After Johnson threw a ball to the screen on a pitch that he claimed "slipped" because of the humidity, Kruk feigned heart palpitations. He was bailing toward the on-deck circle as he waved at two Johnson sliders and took a seat.
After the game, Kruk told reporters he would rather have his "testicles pulled off" than face Johnson again. He promised to veto all trades to the American League if it meant he would have to hit against Johnson.
"If it were the ninth inning of the seventh game of the World Series and it was my turn to bat and he was pitching, I wouldn't play," Kruk said. "I'd wave the next guy up there. Hey, life's too precious. That boy throws too hard and he's too wild. He could kill someone."
Larry Walker, Johnson's former Montreal teammate, added a postscript to the insanity when he jumped in the batter's box from the right side during the 1997 All-Star Game in Cleveland. It made for great comic theater, but in reality, Walker was one of the few lefties who had a clue against Johnson. He batted a career .393 (11-for-28) against the Big Unit.
After the Mariners overcame a 13-game deficit to force a one-game playoff with the Angels for the American League West title, it was only fitting that Johnson would be on the mound for the big showdown.
The Big Unit posted an 18-2 record with 294 strikeouts in 214 innings in 1995, and he was typically masterful in Seattle's 9-1 victory over California.
Johnson froze Tim Salmon on a backdoor slider for the final out, then threw his arms in the air and gazed skyward in celebration. He looked like a human version of the Space Needle. The Kingdome went wild in celebration, and it seemed as if half the city's police force escorted the Mariners to the airport for the flight to New York to begin the playoffs.
For the record, in his final six starts of 1995, Johnson threw 119, 122, 122, 127, 133 and 125 pitches. Talk about a workhorse: Johnson surpassed 140 pitches in four previous starts, and topped out with a staggering 158 in a win over Cleveland in July.
"When he had his game face on, there was nobody like him," says former Seattle bench coach John McLaren. "He had the heart of a lion. It wasn't as if you thought you had a chance to win that day. You knew you were going to win that day. That's how good he was."
It's no secret that Johnson and Curt Schilling weren't the best of friends during their time in Arizona. Schilling loved to express his opinions and seemed to crave publicity. Johnson could be surly and aloof, and spent most of his time in a cocoon.
But professional courtesy reigns supreme, and Schilling spoke for a lot of people after the 2001 World Series when he observed, "That relief appearance is everything you ever need to know about Randy Johnson."
A day after throwing seven innings and 104 pitches to beat the Yankees 15-2 in Game 6, Johnson jogged out of the bullpen to throw 17 pitches and record the final four outs in Arizona's series clincher. Johnson's valiant relief pitching set the stage for Luis Gonzalez's climactic single off Mariano Rivera in the ninth.
Johnson confided to outfielder Steve Finley before the game that he was ready to go, but it was natural to wonder how much he had left in the tank.
"It's all adrenaline," Johnson said amid the postgame celebration. "This is what we play for."

Johnson posted a 21-6 record in 2001, led the National League in strikeouts and ERA, captured the Cy Young Award and was named co-MVP of the World Series. But he was not a factor in Audubon Society Man of the Year balloting.
In perhaps the most bizarre baseball incident since Duane Kuiper went deep, Johnson threw a spring training fastball to San Francisco's Calvin Murray just as a dove was flying in front of home plate. The unfortunate bird went "poof," according to Murray, and disintegrated amid a cloud of feathers, but will be memorialized for eternity on YouTube.
Arizona manager Bob Brenly joked that Johnson might get arrested "for hunting dove out of season," but the predominant reaction was shock. The dove landed 10 feet behind home plate, and Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked it up and jokingly pointed it at Johnson before carrying it into the dugout.
"I've never seen that before, and I'll probably never see that again," said Arizona catcher and master of the obvious Rod Barajas.
When Johnson struck out Deion Sanders and Juan Castro in the ninth inning of an Arizona-Cincinnati game in Phoenix, he joined Roger Clemens and Kerry Wood as the only pitchers to strike out 20 batters in nine innings.
Reds batters lined up to confirm that Johnson's stuff certainly sounded formidable.
"They told us to lay off his slider and hit his fastball, but, man, you couldn't tell the difference until it was on top of you, and then it was too late," said outfielder Alex Ochoa, who struck out three times. "He was throwing 97 mph fastballs and 88 mph sliders and all you could do was say, 'Oh, God.'"
Dayton Daily News reporter Hal McCoy, who had covered Tom Browning's perfect game and no-hitters by Tom Seaver and Rick Wise in his 29 years on the Reds beat, called Johnson's performance the best he had ever seen by a major league pitcher.
Arizona's Mark Grace, who played first base the night of the 20-strikeout game, had previously played first base for the Cubs the night that Wood struck out 20.
"I feel blessed to have seen this twice," Grace said. "When a guy is pitching like that, you put your glove on top of your head because you are not going to need it."

Former Seattle infielder Jeff Huson once observed that the sight of Johnson running the bases was comparable to watching a baby giraffe take its first steps.
"They should show it on the Discovery Channel -- superimpose them both side by side," Huson said. "It would be great."
Johnson made life considerably easier on himself against Milwaukee's Doug Davis, when he enjoyed his first and only home run trot at age 39. Johnson drove a 2-0 fastball over the left-field fence, and returned to a barrage of back slaps and high-fives from teammates in the dugout.
"He puts the ball in play, but I didn't know he had pop," Davis told reporters after the game. "And I guarantee he didn't know it, either."
For the record, the homer came in Johnson's 437th big league at-bat, and pulled him within one of Sandy Koufax's career total of two.

Johnson never feared the big stage, but his introverted and moody personality seemed like a bad fit for the incessant scrutiny of America's sports media capital.
This was confirmed before the blood work was even complete.
After the Yankees acquired Johnson from Arizona by trade in December 2004, the Big Unit only had to pass a physical exam to make the deal official. But first, he had to survive the walk down Madison Avenue without incident.
Johnson was en route from the Four Seasons hotel to his meeting with Yankees doctors when a TV camera from a local news station appeared in his path. He was not pleased.
"Don't get in my face," Johnson told the cameraman, Vinny Everett. "I don't care who you are. Don't get in my face."
Johnson quickly apologized, citing the "overwhelming" events of the preceding days for putting him on edge. But the damage was done.
The New York Daily News ran a graphic with assorted Johnson temper tantrums and called it "Randy's Rap Sheet." Among other things, the paper dredged up his confrontation with former Seattle teammate David Segui over some loud music in the clubhouse, and recalled the incident in 1988 in which Johnson punched a wall and broke his hand while pitching Triple-A ball in Indianapolis.
Johnson went 34-19 in two seasons in New York, but posted an 0-1 record with a 6.92 ERA in three October appearances. In December 2006, he requested a trade to be closer to his home in Arizona after his brother died of a brain aneurysm. When the Yankees dealt Johnson to the Diamondbacks a month later, both parties were ready for a split.

Johnson struck out 19 batters and didn't issue a walk in a 4-1 loss to Oakland, but that wasn't the main topic of conversation among fans leaving the Kingdome after the game. Most of the attention focused on a fifth-inning showdown between Johnson and his former University of Southern California teammate Mark McGwire.
With two out, Johnson threw a 97 mph fastball on a full count to McGwire. The ball left McGwire's bat at 105 mph and landed eight rows into the second deck in left-center field at the Kingdome. The distance was initially estimated at 538 feet, then amended to 474 feet.
Johnson had some fun with the encounter the next day, calling an impromptu "press conference" and wondering aloud if McGwire might have corked his bat. Johnson then produced a souvenir Kids Day bat with a wine cork glued to the top.
In hindsight, it's easy to dismiss McGwire's home run because of the subsequent steroid allegations against him. But the people in Seattle that day weren't thinking about chemical enhancement.
"When he hit that ball, it was surreal," says John McLaren, who was sitting in the Mariners' dugout beside manager Lou Piniella. "You went, 'God, did I just see that?'"
Johnson and the Mariners weren't the only ones in awe of McGwire's tape-measure shot. McGwire's fellow Bash Brother, Jose Canseco, gushed about his teammate's power.
"He's not human," Canseco told reporters. "He doesn't count. Check his blood. Mac's an alien from the future who's come back to show us how to play this game."
Owning Wade: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-handed pitcher to strike out perennial batting champion Wade Boggs three times in a game. "He's got a great fastball -- right up there with Dave Righetti and Dan Plesac,'' Boggs said after the game.
The out pitch: Johnson first referred to his lethal slider as "Mr. Snappy'' in a Major League Baseball commercial in 1995.
Comic relief: Johnson provided the money closing line in Tim Lincecum's entertaining MLB 2K9 commercial this spring. In the ad, Johnson approaches Lincecum in the Giants' clubhouse, acknowledges the apparently nude virtual Lincecum standing beside the 2008 Cy Young winner and observes, "He should put a towel on.'' Never has a 45-year-old deadpan sounded so good.

At the height of the free-agent shopping season, the average baseball fan was paralyzed with fear about the credit crunch, the housing meltdown, rising unemployment numbers and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
The average MLB executive was, too. So it was understandable that once Mark Teixeira, CC Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and a few other players received their big-ticket deals, general managers throughout the game spent a lot of time trolling for bargains.
Which teams did the best job? In this week's edition of Starting 9, we take a look at nine players who've given their clubs valuable contributions at very affordable prices.

Branyan

The Mariners announced the Branyan signing in early December on the same day they named Rick Adair pitching coach and John Wetteland bullpen coach. Suffice it to say that the M's did not have to bring in emergency phone operators to handle the barrage of ticket requests.
But first impressions can be meaningless. Branyan is tied for third in the American League with 19 homers, and he has a better slugging percentage (.606) than Mark Teixeira, Kevin Youkilis, Carlos Pena, Justin Morneau and Miguel Cabrera. Even if those numbers don't get him to the All-Star Game, his professional renaissance is heartening.
"For whatever reason, I've always been enamored of the guy," a veteran scout said of Branyan. "The strikeouts have always been the biggest knock against him. But sometimes with guys like that, you just have to keep putting them out there."
For years, Branyan was viewed as more a Rob Deer-like curiosity than a threat to play every day, but Seattle general manager Jack Zduriencik believed that he had more to offer.
Seattle's 2008 first-base contingent of Richie Sexson, Miguel Cairo and Bryan LaHair ranked last in the American League with a .680 on-base plus slugging percentage. The Mariners were willing to live with the strikeouts in exchange for some pop. Branyan, having a career year at age 33, has given the team power and a whole lot more.

Hudson

Scouts spend a lot of time talking about bat speed, range and arm slots, but the lingo is different with Hudson, whose energy is palpable from the dugout, press box or loge.
"He's a joy to watch," a National League scout said.
Hudson landed in the Dodgers' laps for three reasons: (1) Potential suitors were concerned about his ability to come back from wrist surgery; (2) as a Type A free agent, he required the signing team to surrender a first-round draft pick; and (3) he overpriced himself. The word on the streets was that Hudson wanted $50 million for five years.
Even if the Dodgers have to pay all of Hudson's incentives and he makes $8 million-plus, it's still a fine deal. Lots of people who watch the Dodgers on a daily basis think Hudson and Casey Blake have been the team's co-MVPs through the first three months.
Hudson's average has dipped below .300 after a rough June, but he still ranks sixth in the National League in hits and seventh in doubles. He also has been a stabilizing influence for a defense that's made only 33 errors -- fourth-fewest in the majors.
The "intangibles" part can't be ignored. Hudson is a take-charge guy in the field, a one-man greeting committee in the clubhouse and a perennially upbeat, talkative presence on a club. His teammates love him.

Abreu

Agent Peter Greenberg's group assembled a 28-page statistical profile to sell Abreu to clubs this past winter. If teams were impressed by the numbers, they had a strange way of showing it.
Three days before Valentine's Day, Abreu took an $11 million pay cut to sign with Los Angeles. The financial squeeze put on him was amazing when you consider Abreu was one of only five major leaguers to produce 100 runs and 100 RBIs in both 2007 and 2008. The other four: Chase Utley, Adrian Gonzalez, Alex Rodriguez and David Wright.
Although the Angels would prefer more than four home runs in three months, Abreu remains a tough out: He's hitting .329 with runners in scoring position and ranks 13th in the American League with 4.11 pitches per plate appearance.
He also has been a nice fit for manager Mike Scioscia's go-go, first-to-third-obsessed Angels. With 17 stolen bases in 20 attempts, Abreu is looking quite spry for a 35-year-old. As Yankees hitting coach Kevin Long used to say, "He's always going to put something in the basket."

Hernandez

If we told you in spring training that Hernandez would rank second on the team behind Johan Santana with 93 2/3 innings pitched on July 1, you would have predicted the Mets were in trouble.
They are -- but not because of Hernandez.
The Mets signed Hernandez, a longtime favorite of general manager Omar Minaya, to a minor league deal in February. After 15 starts, he's 5-3 with a 4.04 ERA and a reliable performer in a rotation that has lost starters John Maine and Oliver Perez to injuries for an extended period.
Hernandez consistently has pitched deep into games, and he's suffered from a lack of run support, so his won-loss record could be better. He lost 3-0 to St. Louis and 4-2 to the Yankees, and picked up a no-decision in a 2-1 defeat to the Dodgers.
Hernandez pitched relatively well in Minnesota early last season before AL lineups began clobbering him with regularity. He got in better shape this year to take some strain off his right knee, so the Mets have reason to hope he shows more staying power. No one has ever questioned his ability to navigate big league lineups.
"He doesn't give in -- ever -- to a hitter," Mets catcher Brian Schneider told Adam Rubin of the New York Daily News. "It doesn't matter if guys are on base or not. Even with guys on base, he doesn't pump a lot of fastballs. He still pitches. The biggest thing I've noticed about him is he's always so relaxed out there."

Podsednik

Podsednik was looking for work in spring training after being released by Colorado when he asked former Chicago teammate Mark Buehrle to pass along his phone number to White Sox general manager Kenny Williams.
One thing led to another, and the Sox signed Podsednik to a minor league deal in April. Now Buehrle might want to ask for a finder's fee.
Podsednik, 33, moved into Chicago's starting lineup May 1, and he's looked a lot like the guy who gave the White Sox such a spark during their 2005 championship season. He leads the team with 21 multihit games, and he has a .399 on-base percentage since May 25. He also has done a nice job defensively in left field.
Manager Ozzie Guillen began the season with Chris Getz and Josh Fields in the 1-2 spots, but Podsednik and Alexei Ramirez have since taken over and given the White Sox a more stable look at the top of the order.

Green

Several six-year free agents have made positive impacts this season. The list includes Angels pitcher Matt Palmer, Giants reliever Brandon Medders, Marlins reliever Kiko Calero, Mets catcher Omir Santos. And let's not forget about Dodgers veteran pitchers Jeff Weaver and Eric Milton, who have a combined 6-3 record and a 3.67 ERA.
Still, no one embodies the can-do spirit of the minor league free agent more than Green. He has versatility and a strong arm, but his most valuable asset is his refusal to take no for an answer.
Green broke into pro ball as a 32nd-round draft pick with Atlanta and subsequently drifted to Tampa Bay, the Yankees, Pittsburgh, Seattle and the Yankees again before hooking on with Boston in January.
Green received more than a cursory look during spring training with Dustin Pedroia away at the World Baseball Classic, and he made an impression by hitting .349 in the Grapefruit League.
He's continued to make a contribution even though the smart money said he was destined to get overexposed eventually. Injuries to Julio Lugo and Jed Lowrie created an opening at shortstop in Boston, and Green took advantage. He's hitting .380 (19-for-50) with runners in scoring position, and his 320-foot shot inside the Pesky Pole gave Boston a 6-5, walk-off win over Atlanta two weeks ago.
The Red Sox are 35-15 when Green starts and 12-14 when he doesn't. If he keeps this up, an honest-to-goodness seven-figure contract might be in his future.

Everett

During an 8-3 Detroit victory over Kansas City in late May, Everett made a diving stop up the middle and turned it into a 6-4-3 double play. It was a classic Web Gem. Yet a day later, Tigers manager Jim Leyland spent more time talking about a couple of other plays made by Everett that might have looked routine to the casual observer but weren't.
Everett, long regarded as the class of shortstop defenders by hard-core analytical types, played sparingly in Minnesota last season because of shoulder tendinitis. Now he's healthy and making a huge difference in Detroit, where Tigers pitchers suffered from Edgar Renteria's lack of range at short last season.
The left-side combination of Everett and third baseman Brandon Inge has been particularly beneficial to rookie pitcher Rick Porcello, who yields a lot of ground balls and needs to make every pitch count.
"If you have a good defense, you can make a good pitching staff into a great pitching staff," Leyland said. "If you have a horse[bleep] defense, you can make a good pitching staff into a horse[bleep] pitching staff. I wouldn't say we're a great defensive team, but we're pretty good."
Everett always will have that Mark Belanger feel to him at the plate, but he's had his moments. He's batting .269 with runners in scoring position, and he hit a grand slam against Cleveland in early May.

Counsell

After the Brewers declined to exercise Counsell's $3.4 million option in November, reporters asked general manager Doug Melvin who might fill the Craig Counsell utility role from 2008.
"Craig Counsell," Melvin told them.
All it took was some time for events to coalesce. Counsell, a Wisconsin guy, wanted to stay close to home, and the market for 37-year-old utilitymen wasn't exactly vigorous.
"It was a natural fit," Brewers assistant GM Gord Ash said. "But when you're a veteran player taking a reduced deal, it takes a little more time. When he satisfied himself that there wasn't anything else out there, we were fortunate enough to get him to come back."
Counsell (.297 batting average, .364 OBP) and rookie Casey McGehee helped the Brewers overcome a major jolt caused by Rickie Weeks' season-ending wrist injury. Milwaukee's second-base contingent ranks fourth in the majors behind Philadelphia, Texas and Toronto with an .849 OPS.

Eckstein

Eckstein has a .749 OPS in road games compared to .611 at Petco Park. One of these days, he'll fly out to the warning track, then snap and throw his helmet in anger, a la Phil Nevin.
In the meantime, he's doing all the little things the Padres expected. Eckstein is the second-toughest hitter to strike out in the National League, and he's been hit by a pitch six times, increasing his career total to 131 HBPs. He took a Roy Oswalt fastball in the ribs and a Carlos Zambrano pitch in the collarbone during a two-week span in May but got back up both times.
Eckstein also has moved baserunners, mixed in a squeeze bunt or two, run out every ball, helped put young shortstop Everth Cabrera at ease and hit .385 (25-for-65) with runners in scoring position. Despite a dreadful May, he has 31 RBIs.
"Everybody says he's short, he's scrappy, he's a gamer," Padres closer Heath Bell told the Los Angeles Times. "He's a great baseball player. You don't hear that. You just hear he's a scrappy ballplayer."
"Great" might be a stretch. But Eckstein fills his role nicely -- not to mention cost-efficiently. That attribute can make a player awfully popular these days.

Lots of spring training scenarios have played out according to expectations in April, May and June. The Yankees, Rays and Red Sox are duking it out at the top of the American League East. Stephen Strasburg is as good as advertised. And although no one could have predicted that Ubaldo Jimenez would be 14-1 with a 1.83 ERA, everybody knew the kid was for real.
These storylines can all be filed under "What else is new?"
But several other developments have seemingly come out of nowhere. Milwaukee outfielder Corey Hart, regarded by many as a non-tender candidate this past winter, is tied for the National League home run lead with 18. Adrian Beltre, acquired by Boston in large part for his defensive acumen, is hitting .349. We've seen no-hitters by Jimenez and Edwin Jackson, perfect games by Dallas Braden and Roy Halladay and a third perfecto by Armando Galarraga ruined by a bad umpire's call. Umpire mea culpas have suddenly become fashionable as the debate over expanded use of instant replay continues.
As the All-Star Game approaches, the division standings and statistical leaderboards feature their share of surprises. In this week's Starting 9, we take a look at nine team and individual storylines that no one could have foreseen. Can they persist through September? Learning the answer will be the fun part.
Here's something to keep in mind as everybody ponders how shocking it is to see the Padres in first place: They went 19-11 in the final month last year, so they got a little taste of winning in September and October.
When ESPN.com polled 36 Internet and TV analysts in March, not a single one picked the Padres to win the NL West. Even the Reds, Tigers and Mets -- other clubs that have defied spring training conventional wisdom -- were regarded as potential postseason candidates if a lot of things went right.
The lack of a supporting cast for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez was a source of concern in San Diego, and it has proved to be well-founded. But pitching and defense can mask a so-so batting order. San Diego's rotation has been solid with the exception of Kevin Correia, and closer Heath Bell and the bullpen have been terrific. Setup man Luke Gregerson is turning into the Cliff Lee of relievers, with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 51-to-4.
Although Petco Park helps the overall numbers, the Padres are 22-14 with a 3.26 ERA in away games. That's the best road ERA in the majors.
"I can promise you this: When our guys are on the mound looking in for a sign, they're not thinking about what park they're pitching in," Padres pitching coach Darren Balsley said. "It never enters their minds."

Boesch

Boesch led the Double-A Eastern League with 28 home runs for Erie last season. But Baseball America ranked him as only the 25th-best prospect in the Detroit chain, in part because of a "stiff, mechanical uppercut swing" with its fair share of holes.
Big league pitchers are having a tough time finding those issues with his swing. Boesch didn't arrive in Detroit until April 23, but he leads AL rookies with 12 homers, 45 RBIs, 30 extra-base hits and a .991 OPS. Six of his 12 homers have traveled an estimated 420 feet or longer. Detroit fans are so smitten, one local radio station is holding a contest to come up with a suitable nickname for him. (Brennan Bash, anyone?)
Boesch, 25, is more mature than the average rookie. His father is an attorney, he played three years at Cal-Berkeley and he's bonded with Miguel Cabrera and his other Latin-American teammates by speaking Spanish with them.
Boesch played in the Dominican Republic this past winter, then hit the weight room and put on 15 pounds. The Tigers took notice of his professional approach in spring training, and he's continued to impress them with his attentiveness to the little things. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, Boesch runs out balls with sufficient fervor that opposing second basemen can't afford to lollygag on routine grounders.
"Last year a couple of us here kept saying, 'We're surprised he doesn't get more attention than he does,'" Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski said. "He's a solid outfielder, he runs well for his size and he uses the whole field as a hitter. But nobody would have anticipated him coming in and putting up the numbers he has this year. When you watch him play now, he's a threat in the middle of the lineup. When he comes up, you expect something to happen. He's got that type of bat."

Prado

Prado hit .300 in the minors and .307 in his first 258 games with Atlanta, so he clearly knows his way around a batter's box. But he spent a lot of years convincing scouts and the Braves' front office that he was more than just a good utility player.
Prado signed out of his native Venezuela at age 17 and spent four years in the Atlanta system before denting Baseball America's list of the organization's top 30 prospects. Prado peaked in 2006 at No. 17.
Four years later, he looks like a budding Placido Polanco. Prado leads the National League with 37 multihit games, and he notched his 100th hit this year in 69 games, becoming the fastest Braves player to reach that milestone since Ralph Garr did it in 62 games in 1974. Philadelphia's Chase Utley leads National League second basemen in the All-Star balloting, but now that he's on the disabled list with a thumb injury, it enhances Prado's chances of starting for the NL squad.
Many baseball people use the word "fearless" to describe Prado. His competitive mindset was on display Sunday against Detroit, when he saw eight straight fastballs from Justin Verlander to lead off the first inning, then took No. 9 -- a 98 mph heater -- and grounded it to right field for a single.
Prado, Eric Hinske and Troy Glaus have helped carry the Braves this season while Chipper Jones, Brian McCann, Jason Heyward, Yunel Escobar, Nate McLouth and Matt Diaz have either underperformed or missed time with injuries.
"I don't know if he's going to hit .300 every year," a National League executive said of Prado. "But he has really good at-bats, he'll give you a ton of doubles and he'll play his butt off for you. He's the heart and soul of that team right now."

Dickey

Two days before Christmas, the New York Yankees strengthened their rotation by acquiring Javier Vazquez in a trade with Atlanta. That same day, Mets GM Omar Minaya added some organizational inventory when he signed Dickey to a one-year, $600,000 deal.
The New York papers were underwhelmed. "Mets Make Move, Too!" read the headline in the New York Daily News.
Little did they know. Dickey, summoned from Triple-A Buffalo in late April, has combined with Hisanori Takahashi to help salvage the team's season in the absence of Oliver Perez and John Maine. He turned in his worst outing of the season Monday against the Marlins in Puerto Rico, but the Mets will take six quality starts in eight appearances.
Dickey's background makes him one of baseball's inspirational stories for 2010. He was an Academic All-American at Tennessee with a 3.35 GPA in English literature. The Texas Rangers offered him an $810,000 signing bonus as the 18th pick in the 1996 draft, then cut his bonus to $75,000 when team doctors discovered he had no ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. When back problems sapped the remaining life from Dickey's fastball, he turned to the knuckleball and spent years trying to master it during stops in Milwaukee, Minnesota and Seattle.
Time will tell whether Dickey has a late-career, Tim Wakefield-caliber run in him. He's already a big reason you're not hearing the words "Jerry Manuel" and "hot seat" in the same sentence anymore.

Olivo

McCann, Yadier Molina and the other usual NL catching suspects are having below-average years at the plate. Olivo, meanwhile, has a .909 OPS -- which puts him 100 percentage points ahead of Joe Mauer. On merit alone, he should be starting in the All-Star Game.
Olivo averaged 17 homers per season with Florida and Kansas City from 2006 through 2009, but he also struck out 434 times and drew 49 walks. He was making Bengie Molina look like a monument to patience by comparison. The Rockies had initially planned to bring back Yorvit Torrealba on a two-year deal this season. When the negotiations stalled, GM Dan O'Dowd signed Olivo to a one-year, $2.5 million contract, and the Rockies penciled him into a time-share arrangement with Chris Iannetta behind the plate.
"We felt very strongly that he was a good fit, and in the right environment he would perform well," O'Dowd said. "He's an unbelievable teammate who brings energy every day to the park."
Olivo's time keeps increasing because of his clutch hitting and knack for bonding with a pitching staff. When Zack Greinke gave his Cy Young Award acceptance speech in January, he spent a chunk of it praising Olivo for his handiwork behind the plate. Olivo became a more diligent defensive catcher in Kansas City with the help of Royals pitching coach Bob McClure, and he's had a positive impact on Jimenez this season.
Olivo is 31 years old and playing for his seventh professional organization. Some players in his position might be touchy over the "journeyman" designation. He's not.
"People say, 'Why have you been with so many teams?'" Olivo told Jim Armstrong of The Denver Post. "I look at it in a good way. Because if nobody wants me, I wouldn't be with anybody."

Guerrero

If Guerrero were at the top of his game, the Rangers wouldn't have been able to snag him for one year and $6 million on the free-agent market. The words "old," "slow" and "decrepit" made the rounds on Vlad a few times during the offseason.
Maybe "proud" should have made it as well. Guerrero's self-esteem took a hit when the winter market was so slow, and he dedicated himself to getting in better shape and re-establishing himself as an elite player. It also helps that he's healthier than he's been in recent years.
"When Vlad was at his best, nobody had more fun playing baseball," said Thad Levine, Texas' assistant GM. "I think he's recaptured that enthusiasm and love for the game. We told him early on, 'You're our cleanup hitter come hell or high water,' and he really was able to relax, settle in and enjoy the game again."
Guerrero has been energized by Elvis Andrus, Neftali Feliz and the other young Latin-American players in the Texas clubhouse. When Guerrero hit for average in April, the scouts were dubious about his lack of power. Then he started driving the ball with authority, and he's already surpassed his 2009 total with those 16 home runs.
Guerrero isn't the only pleasant surprise in Texas. Colby Lewis, 7-5 with a 3.28 ERA, has revived his career after returning from Japan. Josh Hamilton has been on a rampage since a slow start. Darren Oliver and Darren O'Day have been huge factors for one of baseball's most effective bullpens.

Moyer

If you predicted that Moyer and Halladay would have matching win-loss records in late June, feel free to collect your Phillie Phanatic T-shirt at the door.
Things didn't look too good for Moyer when the Phillies pulled him from their rotation to accommodate Pedro Martinez last August. Moyer came across as less than gracious when he summoned reporters in Chicago and complained about being "misled" by Phillies management. The $6.5 million the Phillies owed him in 2010 was starting to feel like an albatross.
But Moyer's resourcefulness and accrued pitching wisdom allow him to continue to defy age and keep picking off museum pieces. Moyer passed Eppa Rixey and Bob Feller to move into 36th place on baseball's career list with win No. 267. With his next victory, he'll tie Jim Palmer for 35th.
Subtract a recent one-inning, nine-run debacle against Boston, and Moyer's ERA is more than respectable. He has a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3-to-1, owns complete-game victories over Atlanta and San Diego and has as many quality starts (eight) as whippersnappers like Mark Buehrle, Cole Hamels, Jackson and Phil Hughes.
Moyer made changes to his slider to better complement his 81 mph fastball and changeup this season.
"I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks," Phillies GM Ruben Amaro Jr. said. "It gives him an added dimension and helps him use another part of the plate. It tells you a lot about Jamie as a pitcher. He's been making adjustments for years, and he continues to make them."
Even the negatives look like positives these days. When Moyer gave up a home run to Toronto's Vernon Wells this past weekend to break Robin Roberts' record of 505 career gopher balls, it was considered a badge of honor for a guy who's become the Julio Franco of pitchers. With 103 victories after his 40th birthday, Moyer is proving that age -- like radar gun readings -- is all relative.

Rhodes

Rhodes has been a solid, reliable pitcher for a long time. With nine more appearances, he'll have 825 big league outings and move past Tug McGraw for 39th place on baseball's career list.
That said, Rhodes is 40 years old, three years removed from Tommy John surgery and pitching his best baseball since 2002, when he went 10-4 with a 2.33 ERA in Seattle. He logged 33 straight scoreless appearances to tie the major league record shared by Mark Guthrie and Mike Myers before giving up three runs Tuesday night against the Phillies.
"There's a very outward, visual, palpable confidence that Arthur has," Reds pitching coach Bryan Price said. "It's not like an arrogance or anything. But he's built this strong expectation that he's going to win the matchup. That's the one ingredient in any great pitcher -- they always anticipate coming out on the winning end."
Rhodes always has had exceptional command for a hard thrower, and he still gets his fastball up there at 92 to 93 mph. He's generally economical with his pitch counts, and manager Dusty Baker has resisted the temptation to overuse him. Rhodes has pitched three straight days only once this season, and he's logged 20 or more pitches in only seven of his 36 appearances.
"He's 40 years old, and we have to appreciate the wear and tear we've put on him," Price said. "We can't ask our guys to do more than we're capable of doing or we're not going to have them in August and September. It's not going to be a workload issue with Arthur."
Home run totals are down this season. Whether it's just a small sample-size blip, a reflection of great pitching or a byproduct of baseball's drug-testing program remains to be seen. But it's a bit of a jolt to look at the home run leaders and see names like Hart, Paul Konerko and Scott Rolen.
And your No. 1 slugging team in the majors: Cito Gaston's Toronto Blue Jays with 115 long balls.
"If you told me that would happen at the beginning of the year, I'd say, 'Wow, Adam Lind and Aaron Hill are probably MVP candidates,'" an American League executive said. "They're doing it from everyone but those two guys."
Basically, yes. Wells is having a big comeback year, and Jose Bautista, Alex Gonzalez and John Buck have hit a total of 47 home runs. Lind and Hill have combined for 20 homers, but they're also hitting an aggregate .196.
The Blue Jays rank 28th in the majors with a .306 on-base percentage, and they're third in slugging percentage at .440. According to FanGraphs, they're swinging the bat a major league-high 48.6 percent of the time.
"They like to hit fastballs," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel told reporters before a series with the Jays this past weekend. "They hunt fastballs, and they like to hit the first pitch. They like to ambush you. They'll hit 3-0. They get up in the count. And Cito's an old hitting coach -- he turns 'em loose."

FORT MYERS, Fla. -- There are taps to the eyebrow, the side of the eye, below the eye, below the nose, below the lips. A tap below the armpit, below the collarbone, below the pectoral muscles. A tap to the top of the head, then repeat the circuit.
Even if people watch closely during the course of a game, they may never see any of these, because you are taught how to hide these motions. They are intended for you, only you, and for you they are intended to be empowering.
The system is simply called tapping, and while Tom Hanson, the man who teaches this form of what he calls "energy psychology," describes it as sounding "weird,"  Boston Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia is a believer.
Once, Saltalamacchia was too proud to acknowledge that he needed help from someone else, be it a longtime sports psychologist like Harvey Dorfman, whom he once worked with, or Hanson, a performance-enhancement coach to whom Saltalamacchia turned when he was having trouble throwing the ball back to the pitcher, the simplest of tasks for a catcher.
"When I was first coming up, just being young, your ego plays into it," Saltalamacchia said Tuesday morning after concluding a workout here with a session of batting practice, along with two other early arrivals at Sox camp, Ryan Kalish and Daniel Nava. "You don't want anyone to know you're getting help. But you're getting help in the training room, why not get help for other issues?
"I didn't want anyone to know I wanted somebody, I needed somebody. That was a big issue with me. But it's done wonders for me. Going home after a game two years ago, I could have hit the bed and slept for 18 hours because my head was just going, and now, I've learned to be able to work with that. Think smart, think positive. You can't put negatives in your head, it's just going to hurt you all around. It's been great for me."
Saltalamacchia reached out to Hanson last spring when the throwing problem surfaced -- in sporting parlance, it's known as the "yips," the same affliction that can affect a golfer's putting. Saltalamacchia had had surgery the previous September to correct thoracic outlet syndrome, a group of disorders that occur when the blood vessels or nerves in the thoracic outlet -- the space between the collarbone and first rib -- becomes compressed, causing pain in the shoulders and neck, and numbness in the fingers.
As part of the surgery to alleviate the condition, Saltalamacchia had an impinged rib removed from near his right shoulder. During his recovery, the throwing problems surfaced. They grew acute after he was sent down to the minors by the Texas Rangers one game into the season, after he'd hurt his back.
The catcher said his father found Hanson on the Internet. "He called," Hanson said, "after reading about me on a site called YipsBeGone.com."
Hanson said he worked for the New York Yankees in 2001 as a performance-enhancement counselor, but was fired before the end of the season, primarily, he said, because the team was not ready for someone who did what he did.
"I watched [Chuck] Knoblauch go through hell," Hanson said, referring to the former Yankees second baseman who had trouble throwing the ball to first base. "But I never talked to him, and at the time I couldn't have helped him."
It was only in the past couple of years, after Hanson and his wife, Birgit, started their own business in Tampa, that he discovered the system of tapping.
"I didn't make it up," Hanson said. "I learned about it by reading Gary Craig, who is in California and developed something called 'emotional freedom techniques.'"
Hanson's initial reaction? "I thought it was stupid," he said.
But after an encounter with a distraught high school player for whom, Hanson said, the technique produced immediate results, Hanson became a convert. The system, he said, is modeled after the pressure points found in acupuncture. And athletes with the yips, he said, "are in so much pain."
"Tapping helps clear out the negative emotion," he said. "Say you struck out to end the seventh inning, and you still have to play defense and might come up to bat again. How to clear out that negative emotion?
"You focus on the negative. Start on your eyebrows. Focus on the negative. Each site, your eyes, below your nose, below your lip. The idea is to do a tap lap, go down and around, tap the top of your head, then start again. Tapping helps clear out the negative emotion."
Hanson said all the counseling he did with Saltalamacchia was done over the phone. "I've never met Salty," he said, "but he became pretty functional, pretty fast."
Saltalamacchia said that tapping "has been very helpful," and he has maintained a relationship with Hanson. The two may finally get together, both men said, during camp.
Hanson acknowledges that his system represents a sharp break from his previous training in cognitive behavior. "This is below your conscious level," he said. "Tapping is in the family of energy psychology."
Curiously, while Hanson's website biography says he holds his doctorate in sports psychology and he refers to himself as "Dr. Tom Hanson," he writes elsewhere on his site that his degree is actually in physical education, which he confirmed on the phone Tuesday night.
"People don't care," he said about the discrepancy. "It matters to me, it matters to psychologists, but I'm not a psychologist. I have a Ph.D. in physical education with a specialization in sports psychology. I am Dr. Tom Hanson. I have a doctorate."
Hanson also works with businesses -- he cited some work he had done for Verizon -- and said he has heard from numerous athletes.
"I didn't set out to be the 'yips guy,'" he said, "but I happen to be able to fix it."
The problem, which gave Saltalamacchia so much trouble while he was with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate in Oklahoma City, has not surfaced since he came to the Red Sox in a trade last July.
"It was a health issue that kind of grew mental, obviously, but I worked on it," Saltalamacchia said.  "I've got stuff I go through, but as far as I'm concerned it's a dead issue. Are there going to be recurrences? I don't think so. It's one of those things that through my career I'm going to have to deal with, but I don't see it being a problem. I don't think about it. I used to."
Now, Saltalamacchia said, he is able to focus on the challenge before him, which is establishing himself as Boston's No. 1 catcher. That's why he spent much of the offseason working with bullpen coach Gary Tuck on grueling, twice-a-week, 2½-hour sessions of blocking balls, receiving balls and throwing.
"They've said the starting job is mine," Saltalamacchia said. "Whether it's three days a week, four days a week, whatever, I don't know. I'm not really worried about it. My job is the pitchers, to go out there and help them get through their game. When I get to the plate, do my job in whatever way the situation calls for."
Saltalamacchia will share time behind the plate with Jason Varitek, the team captain who turns 39 in April. Of those who suggest the team's biggest question mark, and possible weak link, is its catching, Saltalamacchia said:
"Honestly, I don't have anything to respond to that. What they think and what people are saying is what they want to think and say. We know as a team what we've got to do on the field. We all have a job and we've all got to be there for each other. I'm prepared to do my job, and I'm going to be there for every single guy on the team. I don't look at it any other way than to go out there and play hard every day."
Saltalamacchia is 25, the same age, as has been noted before, that another switch-hitting catcher, Varitek, launched his stellar career with the Red Sox. In some ways, Saltalamacchia agreed, he is an "old" 25 since he has already been traded twice and dealt with a number of injuries.
"I've definitely been through a  lot more stuff than a lot of 25-year-olds, but ultimately it got me where I am now," he said. "I'm in a perfect situation to go out there and make a career out of it."
And it helps, Saltalamacchia said, knowing he has someone to talk to when he hits those rough patches. There is Hanson, there is Dorfman, there is Bob Tewksbury (the former major league pitcher turned sports psychologist).
"It's almost a necessity," Saltalamacchia said. "That's why a lot of teams have gone with shrinks. We've got Tewks for us just to talk about issues. You don't want to go home and talk with your wife, talk to your parents about it. It's good to have someone in baseball who has an outside look on it, that has no ties to you. It's helped me tremendously."

No one knows what Roger Clemens is going to be doing come July 4. Not Roger. Not Debbie. Not Randy or Alan Hendricks.
Astros owner Drayton McLane may be hesitant to pay Clemens what he can command, but he knows Roger's ties to the community, to the Astros, to Andy Pettitte and Brad Ausmus. Rangers owner Tom Hicks knows how deep that Longhorns tie binds them. George Steinbrenner knows Clemens reveres Joe Torre and Derek Jeter.
And John Henry knows only the Red Sox can bring Clemens' career full circle, have his close friend Al Nipper as pitching coach and, since he will likely go into the Hall of Fame in a Boston cap, can retire his uniform No. 21 while he is wearing it.
However, none of them even know if he's going to come back and play, much less when.
But they, we and most everyone else hold one truth to be self-evident: Roger Clemens is the greatest living pitcher.
Now that is a broad statement when one begins to consider the credentials of Tom Seaver, Sandy Koufax, Jim Palmer, Juan Marichal, et al. But not only is Clemens the winningest modern pitcher with 341 victories, but he has done it (and compiled a 3.12 ERA) entirely in the era of the five-man rotation and in three offensive-oriented ballparks: Fenway Park, SkyDome, Minute Maid Park.
Clemens learned a lesson when he was a freshman at San Jacinto Junior College, after going undrafted out of high school. His coach, Wayne Graham, now the head coach at Rice, insisted that Clemens would never be a power pitcher unless he built up his legs and became a workout warrior. Twenty-five years later, it is obvious that Roger listened, because the warrior king is still in premium condition. All these years, you never heard Clemens talk about his arm or shoulder being tired -- only, when he did tire, that "my legs started to go."
Once he signed as Boston's first-round selection in 1983, the makeup was always there. Roger was slated to be the second pitcher in the first spring training game the next spring, and on the Tigers' bus ride across Florida's Polk County, from Lakeland to Winter Haven, one Detroit minor leaguer told his Clemens story.
In a Florida State League game after Clemens signed, a Lakeland first baseman named Jim Morris took out and injured Clemens' Texas teammate Mike Brumley. Morris, it seems, had played at Oklahoma State, a team Texas had had some scuffles with. And when Lakeland went to Winter Haven the next week, Clemens started and struck out the first six batters, then beaned Morris in the head.
"Sparky [Anderson] told the kid to shut up," says Indians pitching coach Carl Willis, who was on the bus. Yeah, and this spring, when Roger's son Koby homered off him in a simulated game, the next time he came up, Roger brushed back his own kid.
When Clemens needed shoulder surgery in 1985, Dr. James Andrews said, "He was the first athlete I ever operated on who'd started his rehab before the operation." A year later, Clemens had the first of two 20 strikeout/no-walk games, finished 24-4 and won both the MVP and Cy Young.
He has won six more Cy Young Awards (with one second- and two third-place finishes), led his league in ERA six times and in wins five times, won 12 more postseason games and at the age of 43 compiled a 1.87 ERA. And oh yes, he pinch-hit in the NLCS.
And at 44, he may hold the key to three divisional races.

Although I grew up in Teaneck, N.J., and considered myself well versed in surviving harsh winters, the massive storm that hit Chicago earlier this month made me rethink what was possible when it snows. Besides hearing unusual terms like "thunder snow" or hearing how people got stuck on Lake Shore Drive for nine hours while "dealing with upwards of 70 MPH winds," the image that burned into my consciousness was a team of fire engines being escorted by snowmobiles in the middle of Chicago's city streets.
The day after this blizzard, I attended an event for the Chicago Baseball Museum honoring the life and legacy of Negro Leagues star Buck O'Neil. I came to learn that what he navigated in his life, to reach the pinnacle of the game as its ambassador, resembled something a lot like this history-making snowstorm in the Windy City.
You wouldn't know it from Buck that he had hardships. He was a peaceful man, humble, who after his disappointment of missing the Hall of Fame by one vote, spent the next moments consoling all of his weeping supporters to let them know that his being a Hall of Famer in their eyes was all that mattered. He then spoke at the Hall induction service on behalf of the Negro Leagues players who did get in.
I have had the gift of meeting many of our former Negro Leagues players and their supporters. From the group of Philadelphia Stars who became part of a city movement to have a memorial built for their legacy, to the bread I broke at the Negro League Cafe with Chicago's finest Negro Leagues players, to the snapshot I took with Rachel Robinson shortly after I had just finished reading a book about her inspirational husband Jackie, who she helped inspire.
In navigating the two feet of snow that ultimately fell, there were moments when time seemed to have stopped. Neighbors wandered the streets sharing stories, helping each other dig their cars out from the mound of snow that the city plows had created. Most people had heeded the warnings to stay off of the roads, avoid conflict, take it easy, but then again, many had no choice, like the gentleman I met on the train who had to put in his full day's work before taking a bus to a train home.
I imagine that Buck O'Neil and his Negro Leagues contemporaries enjoyed performing on the field, doing what they clearly loved to do, but I also imagine there were blizzards in their path often steeped in misunderstanding, hate, racism and ignorance, while they played. For the most talented, professional baseball became their livelihood and a ticket away from the stagnation in the local leagues of their hometowns, but not without a great price.
At this event for Buck O'Neil, one story told by Chicago Tribune writer Fred Mitchell talked about how Billy Williams was fed up with the racism he was experiencing in his journey through the minor leagues, so he went back home to Mobile, Ala. As his mentor, the Cubs sent Buck O'Neil to intervene in the classy, unassuming way he was known to possess. He took Billy to his old stomping grounds, to the field where he began his journey as a bona fide star. Upon talking to all of his old teammates and locals, Billy heard how proud they were of him, that they had admired his ability to play baseball for a living. He came to see how much his success was a reflection of something bigger than his personal achievements; he had a community riding on his hopes, for they were the hopes of an entire generation. He was their legacy.
Billy rejoined his minor league team, something Buck O'Neil knew would happen long before Billy made his decision.
After numerous encounters with Negro Leagues players, what most awes me is their humility. These players are gentlemen who played during of time of racial tension with a glass ceiling for major league career possibilities. Keeping in mind that Buck O'Neil expressed joy that he played against the best (Ruth, et al.) and with the best in his Negro Leagues teammates, so he didn't speak of missing out. Maybe that is why they did not know of limitation in their spirit, in their sense of hope. Even with certain parks closed to them, they still competed against and with top talent.
We often forget that many of these men served their country. Buck O'Neil was committed to the U.S. Navy (as were many others) during the thick of his productive years. Their service reverberated their hopes for a better future America, because the America of their playing days did not embrace them as full citizens in many ways. Buck believed that this didn't necessarily limit his potential, but America's potential. There was still so much segregation, so much animosity for the players, like a Billy Williams, who was trying to follow a small path blazed by a few who came before him.
When I look back at my career, I understand that my opportunity was directly dependent on my Negro Leagues forefathers and their vision. My career does not happen without courageous men and women who had patience and a belief in something bigger than a moment or a season. Jackie Robinson stayed firmly silent even with the blizzard all around him, so that the next path could be cleared for someone else.
What I have come to understand even more firmly is that these men and their families endured a lot of trials and tribulations to do what they loved to do. Sure, I played for some managers who did not care for me. Sure, I took a shower under the bleachers in some rough minor league cities. Sure, I felt frustrated by my playing time for the 2004 Phillies, but my journey was like staring outside the window of a log cabin with hot chocolate in your hand while Buck O'Neil was digging a car out of two feet of snow that wasn't even his own.
There are people that come your way and mark a time in your life that transform you, maybe even transform history. And when I think of the sheer blindness I felt when I drove through some of the worst of that blizzard, I couldn't help to feel that I needed something bigger than my own driving ability to make it home. I needed to rely on instincts, some sense of having been there before, which is to rely on those who have cleared the way to see me through. Then once I reached home with my family, I understood that people like Buck O'Neil had a gift to be able to see the calm, to see the possibility even in the midst of the worst of conditions and having that kind of gift cannot help but become a gift for everyone you touch. For now they can see through anything.

When Carlos Delgado finally arrives at Shea Stadium, he'll bring a thunderous bat that'll turn the Mets into one of the National League's better run-producers. But Delgado also carries leftover baggage from last year's contentious free agent courtship, during which the first baseman developed a strong dislike for one of GM Omar Minaya's key assistants, Tony Bernazard.
Whether there's leftover animosity remains to be seen. Delgado's agent, David Sloane, said in an e-mail Wednesday afternoon, "We're waiting to see how the Mets want to handle it. No comment until then."
The Mets don't regard the situation lightly, considering Delgado will have the contractual right to demand a trade after the 2006 season. If the club is unable to fulfill that request, Delgado automatically becomes a free agent again in 2007. While the Mets find it hard to believe the slugger would walk away from the $32 million he'd be owed in 2007 and 2008, one Mets official planned to speak directly to Delgado by the end of the day.
"We consider this water under the bridge," is how another Mets executive put it. Indeed, the stakes are different now, as Delgado undoubtedly realizes the Mets, not the Marlins, offer a better path to the postseason. But sooner or later, Delgado will come face to face with Bernazard, a fellow Puerto Rican, and the charges that he levied against him -- specifically, that the Mets overplayed the racial and ethnic connection during their recruitment.
Things got so bad that at last year's winter meetings, Delgado derisively called Bernazard, "the highest paid translator on the planet."
How, exactly, did their relationship disintegrate? According to one person familiar with the dialogue, Bernazard made the mistake of addressing Delgado in "street" Spanish, either unaware or indifferent to the fact that Delgado is intelligent, well-spoken and highly principled.
One two occasions, Delgado had Sloane tell the Mets to keep Bernazard away from the recruitment process -- or as the source put it, "he didn't want to have anything to do with the guy."
Ultimately, Bernazard was forced to the sidelines while Minaya took over. But it was too late at that point. Delgado decided it was a lack of respect that allowed Bernazard to be the Mets' point man, figuring a Spanish-speaker would have a built-in advantage. Delgado drifted towards the Marlins, where Sloane said his client would have a better chance of getting to the World Series. Delgado eventually signed a four-year, $52 million contract, although he was paid only $4 million in 2005.
With the bulk of his fortunes still ahead of him, the Mets are hopeful that Delgado will forget about the crossed signals. The first baseman is joining a team that has a distinctly Latin flavor, where Spanish is the language of choice in the clubhouse. If Delgado still has a problem with that, the Mets think their on-field upgrades will be enough to put Delgado at ease, once and for all.
One other issue lingers, though: what will Delgado do about his pledge to not to stand for the playing of God Bless America? He managed to avoid the spotlight in past years when playing in New York, remaining in the visitors' dugout or clubhouse. That was the case everywhere else, too, although when Delgado was caught on the field between innings -- stranded on the bases, for instance -- he would stand.


Delgado will have to confront the issue more directly now that he's a Met, although the song is played less frequently at Shea than at Yankee Stadium, where it's heard every game during the seventh inning stretch.
Nevertheless, the Mets are understandably looking forward, focusing on the enormous windfall their offense is about to enjoy.
"We finished in third place without Carlos last year, so we can only imagine what the difference would've been if we'd had him," said one Mets official. "We're obviously very excited."
So, how, exactly, do the Mets afford this sudden swelling of the payroll? Actually, they still project somewhere in the low-$100 million range, with nearly $35 million coming off the books this winter. That will allow the Mets to continue their pursuit of Billy Wagner, to whom they've extended a three-year offer worth approximately $30 million with an option for a fourth year that makes the deal worth $40 million.
Although Wagner has hinted that he'll need a guaranteed fourth year to justify leaving the Phillies, the Mets are structuring their current offer so the fourth is practically written in stone. One person familiar with the offer says, "only a major injury" would keep Wagner from reaching his performance roll-over, effectively protecting the club and the closer.
Wagner also said he wants to get to the World Series, which is the holy grail for every free agent. The Mets think they have the Phillies trumped in that area, too.
"With Carlos coming, we think Billy will want to come here, too," is how one Mets official happily put it.

NEW YORK -- The baseball world is already envisioning Johnny Damon's before-and-after portrait, now that George Steinbrenner's fashionistas are getting their shears on him. For a cool $52 million, Damon will morph into a clean-shaven, perfectly coiffed, full-blown Yankee -- a surrender he swore would never happen. Not him, not the happy rebel who loved Red Sox Nation (and vice versa).
But that all changed in 48 hours this week, when Yankees general manager Brian Cashman gave Damon and agent Scott Boras a timetable to accept the Yankees' final four-year offer. One person familiar with the negotiations said, "It was more like an ultimatum." Indeed, Cashman told Damon's camp they had until midnight on Tuesday to act.
The Red Sox may or may not have tried to match the Yankees' end-around. The negotiations with Boras had grown so stagnant they might've been entirely clueless that Damon was slipping away, as team president Larry Lucchino insisted. But all postmortems now lead to the same conclusion: the Bombers' lineup looks unstoppable.
Without Damon in 2005, the Bombers finished second to Boston in runs, batting average and on-base percentage. That gap will almost certainly be closed in 2006, unless the Sox can salvage a disastrous offseason.
They can start by acquiring Jeremy Reed as Damon's replacement, but no matter what the Sox's response will be, it's hard to imagine a stronger 1-2 combo than Damon and Derek Jeter. The Yankees are cloning the formula that made them so successful in 1998 and 1999, when Jeter batted behind Chuck Knoblauch.
When Boras was selling the Damon-in-pinstripes concept to Cashman, he was careful not to pit one leadoff hitter against the other. The agent recently said, "The reason this would work isn't because Johnny is better than Derek, but because Derek would be a great No. 2 hitter who would force pitchers to deal with the middle of that Yankee lineup. And that way, the Yankees don't get schooled the way they did by the Angels [in the Division Series] by pitching around A-Rod [who was walked six times in five games]."
The Yankees, ironically, were more focused on Damon as a center fielder, given the lack of market options. With Brian Giles returning to San Diego, Torii Hunter unavailable, no real interest from the Phillies in a Jason Michaels swap and the Rangers asking for Chien-Ming Wang in exchange for Gary Matthews Jr., Damon was the Yankees' last option before finally bestowing the everyday job to Bubba Crosby.
Cashman insisted he would've been fine with Crosby, but admitted that Damon was in his blueprint from the moment the Yankees went out in the first round of the playoffs. They now have a durable, fleet center fielder, albeit one with a below-average arm. But the most immediate dividend is the chaos the Yankees will unleash on American League pitchers.
Damon said as much Tuesday night, referring to the "great lineup" he's joining.
"We're going to be tough to beat," Damon told Channel 4 in Boston.
Interestingly, Damon was no better than Jeter as a leadoff hitter in 2005. Indeed, it was Jeter who had a higher on-base percentage, scored more runs and drew more walks. And Jeter's at-bats lasted longer, too, as he averaged 3.82 pitches per plate appearance to Damon's 3.72, slightly below the league average. But history has shown that Damon can be patient. In 2004, he averaged 4.12 pitches per plate appearance, fifth in the AL. In 2003, he was even better: a 4.13 average ranked Damon fourth in the league.
The Yankees are hoping Damon can be to the 2006 edition what Knoblauch was during the team's late-'90s golden era, forcing pitchers to work harder than usual to get through the first inning, giving the rest of the lineup a good, long look at his arsenal. If Damon is as pesky as Knoblauch, the Yankees figure to prosper. But he'll do more than that, according to one American League scout.
"Johnny's got enough power to be a home run factor in that ballpark," the scout said.
The Yankees don't have to be reminded, since it was Damon's second-inning grand slam off Javier Vazquez in Game 7 of the 2004 AL Championship Series that sent the Sox to the World Series. Two innings later, Damon hit another HR, an upper-deck shot off Vazquez, that was a reminder of what he's capable of in a lefty-friendly hitter's park -- even with a .255 career average at Yankee Stadium.
What really seduces the Yankees is the trickle-down effect to the heart of the batting order. Damon and Jeter will create plenty of scoring opportunities for Gary Sheffield and Alex Rodriguez, and will act as a shield to the lineup's last weak link, Bernie Williams, who'll serve as DH in the No. 8 spot. Robinson Cano, who would've batted second had Damon not been signed, will drop to No. 9, which effectively gives manager Joe Torre three base stealers in succession.
It's a perfect storm, really: the Yankees now blend power and speed for less than it cost in 2005; the payroll is declining from $205 million to $175 million. The Yankees are also younger (Damon is 32, Williams is 37) and, as always, star-driven.
"We're in good shape," one high-ranking Yankees official said, putting the final touch on the grimmest possible Christmas at Fenway.

Another player died. The tragedies came 10 years apart, the circumstances were  different, the only element that was the same was the manager. When the news came that Steve Bechler was no longer alive, Mike Hargrove thought to himself, not with self pity, but with pain, "I can't do this again.'' But that feeling, he said, "didn't last very long.''
Some people can handle these things. Some people can deal with a horrible loss once; Hargrove has gone through it twice. And for that, the Cleveland Indians family of 1993 and the Baltimore Orioles family 2003 are fortunate. Hargrove is one of the good guys in baseball. He's a big, tough Texan with a raspy voice, an engaging manner and a soft heart, especially when a warm touch is needed for people in distress.
We learned that 10 years ago Saturday when two of Hargrove's pitchers, Steve Olin and Tim Crews, were killed in a boating accident during spring training. A third pitcher, Bobby Ojeda, was injured, but survived. The following morning, Hargrove walked toward the Indians' clubhouse in Winter Haven, Fla., to address his team. His players were weeping. Hargrove was only 43 years old at the time and in his third year of managing in the big leagues.
"Right before I went in the clubhouse, I prayed,'' Hargrove said 10 years later. "I had no idea what I was going to say. I asked for His help. I prayed, 'please, let me say and do the right thing.' I love God, but I don't push it on people. But I believe He was at work that day.''
Hargrove had his players draw their chairs together into a circle. "I have no idea what I said,'' Hargrove said. "I can't remember. But as I was talking, I had a feeling that it was good. I talked until I couldn't go any further, then (pitcher) Teddy (Power) took over. When Teddy couldn't go anything further, someone else talked. It was a rare opportunity to glance into each other's hearts for two hours. And, we liked what we saw.''
Ten years later, Hargrove says the tragedy "changed me. I'm more emotional than I used to be. But I was probably too compassionate the first three or four months after the accident. By mid-season, I was too empathetic to the players. The nurturing side of me had taken too much hold. I had to get myself, and my team, back to an even keel. I couldn't do my job if I was trying to fix everyone's problems ... the first time I had to yell at a guy, it felt good. I knew I was back on an even keel. I knew then I was the manager again.''
Two years later, the Indians won their first American League Central Division title. During the celebration at Jacobs Field, Hargrove called Mike Lehr, the club's director of broadcasting, and had the song, The Dance, by Garth Brooks, played over the public address system. That was Olin's favorite song. And all his friends knew that.
"I thought it would mean a lot to anyone who was there (with the Indians at the time of the accident),'' said Hargrove. "For those who weren't there, it had no significance, but it was still a good song. It was a tribute to those guys, to their families. It was part of our promise to never forget them. We didn't tell anyone that we were going to do it. For those who knew, there wasn't a dry eye to be seen. I saw Charlie Nagy, tears were rolling down his face.''


The tears eventually stopped for the Indians, and for Hargrove. "Three, four, five times a year, I just sit there and relive it,'' he said. "It's not painful. It makes me feel good that most of the people involved picked up the pieces, but have kept memories of those guys true.''
And then came Feb. 16 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., when Bechler collapsed, and was rushed to the hospital. Unlike the boating accident, Hargrove saw this one. As Bechler was put on a stretcher, Hargrove wondered if he was going to die. During that night, Bechler would make progress, raising hope, then he would take another bad turn. On Feb. 17, Bechler died.
"I had deep, deep sympathy for his wife, and their baby on the way,'' said Hargrove. "There is nothing that prepares you for something like that. The more it is the same, the more it is different, if that makes any sense. The one thing I learned from 10 years ago is the right thing to do is to get back on the field as soon as possible. It's nice to have three, four, five hours a day when you have something else to think about. Even then, it's very hard.''
Hargrove has never asked himself, "why me?'' He has never wondered why God would ask him to handle such adversity, not once, but twice. He says he doesn't lay awake at night thinking about the boating accident, or the big Orioles pitcher who fell down while running.
"I haven't let it consume me,'' Hargrove said. "If I let it consume me, I would go insane. We are put in situations for a purpose. I have to believe that, I have to trust in that.''

It was a conversation that has rarely, if ever, taken place in a baseball clubhouse. As Pittsburgh Pirates players were milling about, doing nothing of particular interest, Pirates pitcher Ross Ohlendorf stood at his locker and discussed his senior thesis at Princeton. Pittsburgh closer Matt Capps walked by, laughed and said, "Is that the thesis that you stole from me?''
Ohlendorf is a good young right-hander with a 95-mph sinker. He may be the smartest player in baseball and the smartest person in almost any room he enters. When Padres pitcher Chris Young, a Princeton graduate, was asked if Ohlendorf was smarter than he is, Young said, "Oh, he is way smarter than I am. He's on a different level.'' Ohlendorf did not get an 800 (a perfect score) on the math portion of the SAT. "I got one wrong,'' he said, without pretense, but he took a similar test, "and I'm pretty sure I got them all right.''
Ohlendorf majored in Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton, a major that combined mathematics, engineering and economics. His thesis was written on the June amateur draft, which will be held on Tuesday. Ohlendorf examined the top 100 picks from 1989 to 1993, tracked the progress of each player for a 12-year period, starting with the draft, to determine the value of the picks. Ohlendorf studied the investment (signing bonus) and the financial return from signing the player.
"The financial return is not cut and dry like the signing bonus, so I did my best to estimate it for the players in the study,'' he said. "The vast majority of the return was determined by the player's contribution in the major leagues prior to reaching free agency, and his salary over that period.''
What were his findings?
"On average,'' Ohlendorf said, "the player brought twice the return.''
The 126-page thesis is brilliantly written and so complex, only a mathematician would be able to completely comprehend its meaning. So Ohlendorf broke down his thesis in layman's terms. For each player, he estimated how much less the team paid the player in each of his pre-free agency years than it would have paid a comparable free agent. He gathered salary data for both the players in the study and for all free agents for the relevant years. He used Win Shares (a statistical formula used by Bill James) to determine each player's value.
"Many of the players in the study did not make the major leagues,'' Ohlendorf said. "However, many of those who did produced tremendous returns for the teams who drafted them. When looked at as a group, the internal rate of return on all the draft picks in the study was 60 percent. This is an extremely high rate of return. It is saying that if you invest $1, it will grow to $1.60 after a year and $2.56 after two years, and so on  I believe the stock market has had a historical rate of about 7 or 8 percent, prior to the last year. So even though many of the investments did not work out, the upside on those that did was so great, signing the high picks to large bonuses appears to have been a very smart investment.''
Ohlendorf determined that the average signing bonus during those years was $210,236, and the average return was $2,468,127. Here are the top 10 players from his study.
"So based on the assumptions I made in my paper, the A's signing Giambi was the biggest winner in top-100 picks of the 1989 through 1993 drafts because he played extremely well in his first six years of major league service,'' Ohlendorf said. "The White Sox did the best job in these drafts, with an internal rate of return of 217 percent. Their best signing was Frank Thomas.''
Ohlendorf's thesis and his findings are of particular interest this June because Stephen Strasburg, the spectacular pitcher from San Diego State, and his agent, Scott Boras, are in a position to perhaps change the face of the draft. Depending on who you talk to, Boras and Strasburg are expected to ask for a six-year deal worth between $25 million and $50 million -- a long, long way from the average signing bonus of $210,236 in Ohlendorf's thesis.
Ohlendorf was selected by the Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 2004 draft, the 116th overall pick. He signed for $280,000. He has since been traded to the Yankees, and then to the Pirates. Ohlendorf was asked what kind of return his teams have gotten from him.
"This is a good bonus, but is relatively small compared to the salaries paid to most free agents,'' he said. "I believe the Diamondbacks felt my signing bonus would be repaid by only a minimal contribution in the major leagues. Having a little over a year of service time at this point, I would guess that the savings the Yankees and Pirates have realized from paying me the league minimum instead of signing a comparable free agent have exceeded my signing bonus. My hope is that the answer will be an obvious 'yes' in the years to come.''
The Pirates are just happy that Ohlendorf, 26, is on their team. In 11 starts this season, he is 5-5 with a 4.85 ERA. He has exceptional stuff, tremendous control and a really good idea how to pitch. He is amazingly well grounded for someone as smart as he is, and with stuff as good as his.
"When he was thinking of coming here,'' Princeton baseball coach Scott Bradley said, "Ross told me that he threw in the mid- to upper 80s. His pitching coach in high school, Lee Tunnell, who pitched in the big leagues, told me that mid- to upper 80s was not accurate. I thought to myself, 'What, is it closer to upper 70s to low 80s?' Lee told me, 'He is 92-93, Scott. He hasn't thrown a pitch in the 80s since he was 15 years old.'''
Well grounded?
"His freshman year at Princeton,'' Bradley said, "our baseball team had to clean up the lacrosse field. We had to pick up big bags of trash and throw them into a truck. We have some guys from, say, privileged backgrounds here. Some didn't want to pick up any garbage. But Ross ran from his dorm to the lacrosse field. He was on a mission. He was like Paul Bunyan. He was carrying bags and bags and bags of trash on his back. I looked at my assistant and said, 'How special is this kid? He's the smartest kid on the team, he's the most talented kid on the team, and today, he's on a mission to be the best trash-picker-upper on the team.' His mother is so high up in the administration at the University of Texas, she answers only to the university president. But nothing is beneath this kid.''


“

It's like everything he does, he has a plan for it.
”

Smartest kid on the team?
"There was a famous card game at Princeton when Ross played cards for the first time with his teammates,'' Bradley said. "He raised in the middle of a hand. His teammates said, 'What in the world are you doing raising now?' And Ross said something like, 'Three hands ago, Steve had an ace and a king ' He was able to recall plays from three previous hands. At that point, guys threw their cards down and said, 'Let's do something else.'''
Smartest kid in the school?
"He got a B-plus his first semester in a writing seminar, the first B he had ever gotten in school, and he was miffed, so he went to talk to the professor,'' Bradley said. "The professor looked at Ross and said, 'This is a writing seminar at Princeton. With an A, there's nowhere to improve.' He just wants to learn. So when he asks a question about his arm angle, or something about his breaking ball, he just wants an answer. I think [Pirates pitching coach] Joe Kerrigan has done a great job with Ross. He's not afraid of Ross' intelligence. He's not afraid to talk to him because he's a smart guy from Princeton.''
Ohlendorf is also a popular guy in the Pirates' clubhouse. "He is so smart,'' said Pirates shortstop Jack Wilson. "We give him a hard time about how smart he is, and he'll come right back at us. We'll say, 'Ross, what is the percentage chance of this or that happening?' and he'll say, 'The percentage chance of you winning that game of Pluck [a card game] is 65.678 percent, not 65.667 percent.'''
Capps said everyone on the team is dazzled by Ohlendorf's intelligence. "It's like everything he does, he has a plan for it,'' Capps said, then laughed and said, "He didn't steal the thesis from me.''
The thesis was so good, Ohlendorf was given an Associate Membership into the prestigious Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. And, by the way, what grade did he get on the thesis?
"I got an A,'' Ohlendorf said.

The names and teams aren't important, but here's what happened in July 2008 on a beautiful evening at Nationals Park. The visiting pitching coach went to the mound to talk to his pitcher, who was laboring slightly.
"I can't pitch any more," the pitcher told the pitching coach.
"Are you hurt?" the pitching coach asked.
"No, I just can't pitch any more," the pitcher said. Then he walked off the mound.
He had thrown 90 pitches.
Welcome to the new age of baseball, an age in which complete games are rare, an era that has brought a new magic number of pitches by a starting pitcher: 100. At that point everyone worries about his either getting hurt or getting rocked.
In 1988, 18.5 percent of all starts were in the 96-105 pitch range. In 2008, that number jumped to 32 percent. In 2000, there were 454 starts of at least 120 pitches. Last season, there were 71 starts, or 1.5 percent, an 84 percent drop. In 2009, 1.9 percent of starts have been 120 pitches.
The drop from 120 to 100 can be traced to 2001, when the percentage of 120-pitch starts fell from 9.3 percent in 2000 to 4.8 percent. Why? What happened in those years? Since then, the decline has been steady. If a pitcher throws 120 pitches now, it is no longer considered normal; in fact, right or wrong, it is almost considered to be abusive.
Here are eight possible explanations for stopping at 100.
The past 15 years have represented perhaps the greatest offensive era in history. The reasons include smaller ballparks, a strike zone the size of a license plate, improved bat technology, steroids, weightlifting and harder baseballs. The 1999-2000 seasons were the apex of the offensive explosion: In 1999, more teams scored 20 runs in a game (nine) than in the decade of the 1960s combined (six).
The game is different now than it was even 25 years ago. The Blue Jays' double-play combination, shortstop Marco Scutaro and second baseman Aaron Hill, has homered in the same game three times this season; it had never happened in the first 32 years of the franchise. So perhaps the explanation is as simple as this: Pitchers were hit so hard and so often in 2000, they were taken out of games long before they got to 120 pitches.
"Since 1968, I believe the intensity of every pitch has gotten harder and harder in the big leagues," said Orel Hershiser, the National League Cy Young Award winner in 1988. "In 1968, guys threw over the top, the ball went downhill and became a moving fastball. When they lowered the mound in 1969, they took away the pitcher's leverage. They took away the plane of the baseball, and a straight pitch became more on the plane of the bat. At that point, pitchers had to move the ball so it was not on the plane of the bat, and to do that, they had to increase the intensity on every pitch. Movement became a key, not just velocity. So with all the elements we have today, if the intensity of one pitch is increased by, say, 10 percent, then 125 pitches becomes 115, which becomes 110, then becomes 100."
Hershiser said the strike zone "now is the smallest it has ever been. When we lost the height on the strike zone, we added some width, but then there was a trend to cut down on violence in sports -- in hockey, the third man in -- in the early 1980s, and with the new rules in baseball, we lost the inside corner. So you pitch in, hit a batter, and a fight starts."
Hershiser made his major league debut in 1983. "I could rest at certain times during the game: two outs, no one on, seventh hitter up in the National League," he said. "I didn't want to show all my bullets at that time, so I'd throw a BP sinker away and get a ground out. If the guy got a hit, no big deal; you had the eighth and ninth hitters up. But you can't do that today with these lineups. You can't throw only 80 percent of what you have. You can't get by with a get-me-over curveball. What used to not be a big deal is now a huge deal."
High-intensity pitches are often high-stress pitches. Teams all across the major leagues don't just count pitches; they count the number of pitches a pitcher makes under duress.
"The philosophy in our organization is, 'How did you get there?"' said Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett. "When we have a 25-to-35-pitch inning, that's highly stressful for a pitcher. Our guys are very conscious of that. When you're in a highly stressful situation -- runner at second base, none out -- one pitch becomes a pitch and a half. We pay attention to that."
"That's the biggest change," said Padres manager Bud Black, who pitched in the big leagues from 1981 to '95. "We have 11-man, 12-man, 13-man pitching staffs today. We develop relievers in the minor leagues, college and even high school. It never used to be that way."
In the 1970s, Orioles manager Earl Weaver often would break camp with eight pitchers. And back then, when the game's best pitchers threw 25 complete games in a season, Weaver would let ace Jim Palmer finish what he started, asking "Who do you want pitching the ninth inning with a one-run lead, Jim Palmer or the ninth-best pitcher on the team?"
But now, the ninth-best pitcher on the team might come out of the bullpen throwing 95 mph. And the ninth-best pitcher on the team might be making a lot of money.
"We've got two relievers on our team who are making $3.5 million a year, and they've never even seen the eighth or ninth inning," said one AL pitching coach. "When you're paying guys that much to pitch the sixth and seventh inning, you have to use them. We took our starter out after six innings the other day, and we lost. But when in doubt, teams take out the starter."
Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan said, "Twenty years ago, did you ever hear a pitcher talking about his role? No. Now, everyone has to know his role, his specific role."
Hershiser laughed, saying, "When I broke in, teams broke camp with eight or nine pitchers, nine to 10 at the most. Rookies prayed they'd keep 10 so they could make the team. Carrying 11 was unbelievable. It was like, 'What are you doing? Your bench is so short.' Now we've got 12 and 13 pitchers on the team! And we have a bunch of relievers who don't like to come into a game with runners on base. So we eliminate even more innings by a starting pitcher by allowing a reliever to start the inning with no one on base."
"We have conditioned our pitchers to go 100," Black said. "It didn't used to be that way. When I came up [1981], we pitched until we were ineffective. We would go 125, 130 pitches all the time. Now it's 100. We have pitch limits in Little League, in high school. We are so cautious of their talent, we are not encouraging them to go on. Today's athlete is bigger, stronger and faster than ever. They should be able to do more, but we don't let them."
Johan Santana won his first Cy Young in 2004; his highest pitch count in any game that season was 116. Jake Peavy won the NL Cy Young in 2007 without completing a game. The three longest team streaks in baseball history without a shutout are by teams in this decade: 645 by the 2001-05 Rockies, 532 (active) by the Padres and 458 by the Nationals.
Pitch counts have existed in the minor leagues for many years. As a minor league catcher in 1965, Duncan said he remembers one of his pitchers being taken out after 100 pitches even though he had a no-hitter going. But the rules on pitch counts today are much stricter.
"In the minor league system, we limit our guys to 100 pitches," said Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu. "When they get to the big leagues, there are health and stress factors. College pitchers might throw 200 innings in a year. So we shut them down. We are trying to maximize innings and maximize starts. You're trying to get 33 starts from a guy. If you push a guy one time out, you might back him off the next. We're looking at total volume."
We are now obsessed with pitch counts. "It's more mental than physical," said one NL manager. "I have pitchers who come up to me all the time when they come off the mound and ask, 'Is that it?' And I say, 'Yeah, that's it,' because I know they don't want to pitch anymore."
There aren't many Josh Becketts in rotations these days. "My philosophy has always been I'm staying in the game until someone comes out and takes the ball, or the game is over," Beckett said. "That way, I'm not tempted to go out there thinking any other way."
The term has been a part of baseball for over 20 years, and is defined as any start that is at least six innings pitched and no more than three earned runs. We have a generation of pitchers thinking if they go six and keep their team in the game, then they've done their job.
"That's the biggest thing to me," said Phillies manager Charlie Manuel. "Six innings, that's about 100 pitches. That's where the magic number came from, I think. When I managed in the minor leagues [in the 1970s], when we got a guy to 120 pitches, we would start to watch, but we'd go as high as 140 pitches. But every year since, [the number of pitches] keeps on dropping."
The Rangers, under club president Nolan Ryan, have changed the definition of the quality start, making it seven innings and three runs, instead of six innings. It seems to be working. The Rangers are pitching better than they have in several years, in part because they're being pushed to go deeper into games.
"Curt Schilling said it best: six innings and three runs is a 4.50 ERA," Beckett said. "That is not a quality start -- not from where I come from."
Twenty years ago, nearly 90 percent of all GMs had played in the major leagues. Now there are three out of 30: Philadelphia's Ruben Amaro Jr., the White Sox's Kenny Williams and Billy Beane of the A's. This decade has brought a new breed of GM, one who is highly educated, can run a spreadsheet and has mountains of data to support his theories.
"We have a new wave of general managers who are deeply into mathematics, analysis, metrics -- I'm not saying it's wrong -- because that's what they charted in the minor leagues," said Rays pitching coach Jim Hickey. "I don't know the numbers, but the new wave of GMs are the ones who have charted that the chance of injury is, say, greater at 85 pitches than it is at 75. And with every five-pitch increment, there's a 22.8 percent more likely chance that someone gets hurt. With each 10 extra pitches, it goes up by five percent."
The new GMs sometimes clash with the old-school manager about how the club should be run. Often, the GM wins.
"My GM used to load reams and reams of paper on my desk about that night's game," one former manager said. "Sometimes I'd read it; sometimes I just throw it in the trash. But in the end, if it comes down to him or me, he's usually going to win. And if the discussion is about pitch counts, he is always going to win."
"What year was it that Pedro Martinez was left in the game against the Yankees in the playoffs?" asked Wakamatsu, referring to the 2003 American League Championship Series when Red Sox manager Grady Little chose to leave Martinez in the game. Martinez lost the lead, the Yankees won in extra innings and knocked the Red Sox out of the playoffs, and Little was fired after the season essentially for leaving a starting pitcher in too long. "After that, the education of the public has changed so much. There was so much public scrutiny over that."
Duncan agreed, saying, "If you're a die-hard supporter of a team, or someone who covers the team, what happens when the top pitcher on the team breaks? Everyone looks at the pitch count. The first thing they're going to do is see if there's any possible way that the pitcher was abused. The media is now setting the standards for how many pitches to throw."
Hershiser said, "The advent of video, and timeline video, and games on TV, have changed a lot of things. There used to be two or three games a week on TV. Now every game is on TV. Scouting has changed completely, also. The mystery of pitching has gone away."
More pitchers are on the disabled list today than ever before. It's a paradox: The less they throw, the more often they get hurt. Long before 2000, there were cases in which pitchers perhaps threw too much and got hurt, including the young A's staff in the early 1980s (Mike Norris, Rick Langford, et al.), followed by the Mets' young trio of Paul Wilson, Bill Pulsipher and Jason Isringhausen. In 1998, sensational Cubs rookie Kerry Wood won 13 games and had a 20-strikeout game, but he broke down the following spring training and missed the 1999 season. That seemed to start making teams be even more cautious with young pitchers.
"It's all about protection now," Beckett said.
The Braves did a great job of protecting their pitchers, and winning games, in the 1990s and into this decade. Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine never went on the disabled list in the 1990s for Atlanta. Maddux had 14 120-plus pitch games with the Cubs in 1991-92. He had five with the Braves in 1993, only four the next two years and none by 1996. Surely other teams noticed the success and durability of the Braves' starters, and followed their lead.
Over the past 10 years, it has become even more important to protect a pitcher's health given the salary explosion that has left the average salary for a major leaguer over $3 million a year. Last year, the Brewers pushed CC Sabathia down the stretch, starting him three straight times on short rest.
"The money has a lot to do with it," Hickey said. "Sabathia throwing that many pitches on short rest would have never happened if he was in the middle of a six-year contract. But he was allowed to do that because he was going to be a free agent."
Hershiser said, "Pitch counts have crept into the heads of managers, pitching coaches and doctors in part because of CYA, cover your ass. When you take an MRI, the look after 50 pitches looks different than the look after 100, and people put numbers to them. No manager wants to lose his job because he got someone hurt. So he stays within the cutoff number."
Duncan said he "doesn't give a damn about what people say about pitch counts because I know the individual pitcher. [Chris] Carpenter threw 114 pitches the other night. It was his first time over 110, but we're aware of his history with his surgeries. What we've done with him and Adam [Wainwright] is to take their bullpen sessions and warm-up sessions and cut them in half. Where they might have thrown 75 pitches before a game, now they throw 40. They're not wasting pitches. That's why we're not reluctant to go 120."
On the final start of the 1989 season, Hershiser threw 11 innings and 169 pitches in a meaningless game, or so it seemed. He underwent arm surgery the next year, and missed almost all of the 1990 season.
"I stayed in that whole game because I was one game under .500 coming in, and I didn't want to finish with a losing record," Hershiser said. "I told [Dodgers manager] Tommy [Lasorda], 'I'm not coming out of this game. I have to win.' I knew I was going to have to have surgery after the season. That game wasn't the reason."
Still, teams noticed that he missed almost a full season after throwing 169 pitches in one game.
"I'd like to know the average age of the rotations in baseball before 2000," said Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. "It seems to me, back then, we had one guy in his 30s, a couple of guys in their prime at 29 to 31, and only one of the five in his early 20s. And those guys could all throw more than 100 pitches in a game. But now, it seems, we have three of the five in the rotation who are in their young 20s. [Former manager] Paul Richards once explained this to me, and it makes a ton of sense: As a young pitcher, the arm is growing. It is developing strength. It doesn't have the musculature that it's going to have in a few years. That's how you develop arm and elbow strains, even core injuries, because a young body isn't like a mature body, and it is just not as strong as it's going to be."
La Russa added, "Young guys today rely on stuff. They throw 100 pitches; they don't pitch 100 pitches. They are max effort on every pitch. And in the minor leagues, they're doing whatever they can to get from Double-A to Triple-A, so the stress level is higher. They're getting to the big leagues younger, there is maximum pressure to perform, and because of that, they are letting it fly. That's how young pitchers develop arm injuries and fatigue. In the old days, pitchers spent time in D ball, C ball; they threw 500-600 innings, sometimes 700-800, on lower levels. There was no carrot out there like there is now to move up. Today's young pitchers are firing 85-90 pitches, fatigue sets in, and the next 15-20 they throw, they're still firing. A veteran at 70 pitches might have all kinds of stuff left. Clubs that have a lot of young pitchers are leery of pushing them because they know it's smart not to push them because they are throwing, not pitching."
Hershiser said, "If your mechanics are good, you can throw 75 pitches without being taxed. But if your mechanics are not in order [as with some young pitchers], you could be worn out at 35 pitches. The light bulb goes on with a veteran pitcher about how to extend his career beyond injury and time by understanding the game. The biggest point of Greg Maddux's career came when he understood that softer was better, that throwing an 83 mph sinker was better than throwing an 88 mph sinker. As a pitching coach, I'd tell our guys that your best day is not your hardest day. That's a huge lesson to learn for young pitchers."
It will take time for young pitchers to learn that. In the meantime, look for the magic number to stay at 100 for a while. But former Orioles pitching coach Mike Flanagan, who won the AL Cy Young in 1979, had an interesting idea on dealing with pitch counts. He had a pitcher who would ask him after virtually every inning, "How many pitches have I thrown?" Finally, Flanagan decided to count every pitch the pitcher threw that day, including every warm-up pitch in the bullpen before the game and every pitch between innings.
After six innings, the pitcher came off the field and asked Flanagan, "What am I at?"
Flanagan said, "250 pitches."
The pitcher never asked again.

The baseball offseason is one of the great misnomers in the game. There is no offseason anymore in baseball. The winter months are filled with signings, trades and moves of all kinds.
Here are 10 offseason stories to watch.
They have three primary free agents, left fielder Johnny Damon, designated hitter Hideki Matsui and starting pitcher Andy Pettitte.
Last winter, the Yankees didn't even make an offer to Bobby Abreu or Jason Giambi, allowing each to leave via free agency even though each had recorded pretty good numbers in 2008. Look for the same thing to happen with Damon and Matsui even though Matsui won the World Series MVP on the strength of his record-tying six RBIs in the clinching Game 6. The Yankees seem to be slowly moving away from having too many DH types, and going with more athletic players. Plus, one of their top prospects is outfielder Austin Jackson, who is very athletic, but it's unclear when he will be ready to play in the big leagues.
To replace Damon and Matsui, the Yankees will check the free-agent market, and certainly will consider free agents Jason Bay and Matt Holliday.
As for Pettitte, look for the Yankees to re-sign him for at least one year. The Yankees also have to determine what they're going to do with Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes. They might put Hughes in the rotation and put Joba in the bullpen as the eventual replacement for closer Mariano Rivera.
Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr., Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Pedro Martinez are all possibilities.
Smoltz says he wants to pitch in 2010, and certainly showed at times in 2009 that he can still pitch. Martinez also proved that, and seemed to truly enjoy the stretch run and the postseason despite not looking very good in losing Game 6 of the World Series (he said he's going to talk to his mother about retiring).

Martinez


Smoltz

Glavine didn't pitch in 2009; if he is indeed done, he would be inducted into Cooperstown the same year as his good friend, Greg Maddux.
Johnson won his 300th game last season, then got hurt, then finished the season in the Giants' bullpen. He is one of the 10 best pitchers of all time. Logically, at 46, he might say this is it. Griffey, who will turn 40 on Nov. 21, is a hard one to read. He hit .214 while playing on bad knees last year. He said he would go home this winter, and talk with his family about possibly playing next year.
He is 21, he is left-handed and he throws in the upper 90s, and has been clocked as high as 102 mph. He is young and raw and undisciplined, but he could command a contract in the range of what Jose Contreras, another Cuban defector, got from the Yankees years ago: four years, $32 million.
"I love his arm,'' one GM said. "But he's got a ways to go before he's ready to pitch in the major leagues, physically and emotionally.''
Indeed, Chapman's ERA was 4.03 in 118 2/3 innings in the National Series this year in Cuba. The asking price will be high, but the ceiling is high on this kid. The Yankees are always considered a player in these types of signings.
Owner Frank McCourt hasn't had significant funds with which to work since he bought the club several years ago, and now, it seems, he will have even less money with which to deal given that he is getting a divorce.
The Dodgers need to acquire at least one topflight starting pitcher, but there is already speculation that they will not have enough money to re-sign left-hander Randy Wolf. If they don't have the money to improve the club, they might have to make a trade or two, and that has to begin with pitcher Chad Billingsley. For him to not make a start in the National League Championship Series -- but Hiroki Kuroda did, and Vicente Padilla made two -- means it's time for him to go.
If the Dodgers don't think Billingsley has the stomach to be a top-of-the-rotation guy, then they should trade him now for pitching help.
Clearly, the economy has not rebounded as quickly as some would have liked. But this is not a strong free-agent class.
Matt Holliday and Jason Bay lead a decent collection of hitters, but the pitching class "is about as weak as I've seen it in a long time,'' said one general manager. John Lackey leads the way, along with Wolf, Rich Harden and Kevin Millwood.
If there are only a few big deals out there this winter, there will be no screams about collusion because there are so few big-name players, not like last year when CC Sabathia, Mark Teixeira, Francisco Rodriguez and Manny Ramirez dominated the winter signings.
After 2009, they have a lot of questions to answer.
The first point of business will be trading volatile outfielder Milton Bradley, but they likely won't be able to do that without picking up most of the two years, $20 million left on his contract. Then they have to sign, find or trade for a dominant personality for that clubhouse -- they haven't replaced the leadership they lost with the departures of Mark DeRosa and Kerry Wood last offseason. And, with the way their offense fell off last year, they have to find a big bat for the middle of the order, someone even bigger than Derrek Lee and Aramis Ramirez, and someone much, much better than Alfonso Soriano.
Then the Cubs have to ask themselves if their pitching is good enough to contend. Is Carlos Zambrano reliable enough to be a No. 1 starter for a championship-caliber club? Is Carlos Marmol the answer at the end of the game?
They lost 92 games in 2009, and not all of them were due to the fact that half the team was hurt. The Mets played some uninspired, ragged, sloppy baseball last year, and that has nothing to do with the many injuries they had.
Certainly, a healthy Jose Reyes and Carlos Beltran will make the Mets significantly better, but there are still holes at first base, left field, behind the plate and at least two spots in the rotation -- and that's assuming ace Johan Santana comes back healthy from surgery on his left elbow. Signing Holliday or Bay to play left field seems imperative, as does signing a top free-agent starter, such as Lackey. There is a question whether the Mets have the finances to do that, but that might be their only choice because it doesn't appear as if they have the farm system to deal for a stud starting pitcher or outfielder.
They have three vital free agents, Lackey, third baseman Chone Figgins and DH Vladimir Guerrero, but they did re-sign right fielder Bobby Abreu to a two-year deal worth $19 million.

Lackey

The Angels do not appear to be particularly aggressive in re-signing Lackey, but they have to. He won Game 7 of the 2002 World Series as a rookie, and even though he has won more than 14 games in only one season in his career, he remains one of the best starters in the American League, a bulldog who never wants to come out of games, as seen in Game 5 of the ALCS against the Yankees.
Figgins had a poor postseason at the plate, but will be coveted by several teams (White Sox? Orioles?) if he gets to free agency. Chances are, the Angels won't let him get away.
He is a free agent. It has been forgotten, but when David Ortiz and the rest of the Red Sox's lineup labored in the first two months of last season, it was Bay who kept the team upright with tremendous production. He hit a major slump early in the summer, but rebounded somewhat at the end of the year.
The Red Sox reportedly offered Bay a four-year contract at $15 million a year, but that apparently was not enough. The Red Sox have some serious decisions to make this winter. Is Ortiz still a significant run producer? Will Mike Lowell stay healthy enough for one more season? If the Red Sox can't sign Bay, Matt Holliday would seem to be perfect in Fenway Park.
He is the premium free agent out there. He is a real baseball player, a baseball junkie, the son of a coach. He tore it up in the National League for several years, then was traded to the A's, where, for the first two months, he didn't look like a dominant hitter.
Then he went to the Cardinals and hit .353 with power for the final two-plus months of the regular season. Is he just a National League player? Is he a product of all those years at Coors Field? Were the first two months in Oakland's spacious park the aberrant sample? These are important questions, but given his age, his character and his incredible strength, you have to think he's worth the risk, even at around, say, $18 million a year.
The Mets need him. So, too, might the Red Sox. The Yankees might even get involved. Holliday is a perfect fit for the Cardinals, but with Scott Boras as his agent, Holliday might be too expensive for St. Louis.

We interrupt the stretch run of this fascinating baseball season with something completely irrelevant, epically ridiculous and wildly unimportant. A most absurd streak quietly ended in 2010: For the first time since 1989, I no longer clip every box score of every baseball game from the nearest newspaper and tape each one into a spiral notebook, a daily task that I've estimated, at roughly 15 minutes per day, has cost me 40 days of my truly pathetic life.
This official announcement comes with some sadness because I love box scores. I've always loved box scores. From 1990-2009, I never missed one day of clipping and taping box scores, a streak that our best baseball fans must acknowledge is far more impressive than Cal Ripken playing in 2,632 consecutive games. On one memorable night in 2002, I went to bed at 11 o'clock, realized in horror I had forgotten to do my box score book, got dressed, clipped and taped my box scores, then lay down for a restful six hours of sleep as my wife looked at me and wondered how she could have married such an unfathomable geek.
I now know how Joe DiMaggio felt when his 56-game hitting streak ended that July 17 day in 1941. He was stopped by Indians third baseman Ken Keltner's two great defensive plays; my equally unbreakable streak was stopped by the slow death of the newspaper business, the business I grew up in, the business I will always love. But in 2009, it became clear that my Washington Post, due to deadline issues, was no longer providing enough box scores in the edition delivered to my house in Darnestown, Md. When only seven boxes out of 15 made it to my driveway, part of the next 24 hours were spent tracking down the missing ones. I couldn't find them all. So I decided 2009 would be my last year.
I probably should have quit my obsession in 2004 when I returned home from a trip to find what had to be considered an omen: A signal to become slightly less obsessive than Rain Man's Raymond Babbitt, Valenzuela is pitching on Thursday. My closet was a shambles, the top shelf had collapsed from the weight of 15 years of box-score books, two books per year, a total of 30. My suits were on the floor, covered with plaster and covered with box scores from 1990. Two suits were ruined, which was especially troubling since it's hard to find size 32 short anywhere other than Nordstrom For Kids.
But my brother, Matt, rebuilt my closet and I continued my quest to save every box score. My wife reminded me several times over the last few years that box scores are available on the Internet, something I was keenly aware of, but being an old newspaper guy, I enjoyed having the hard copy of the box score at the ready, be it in a car, a cab or a plane. Having every box score of a season by my side wherever I went gave me a sense of comfort. If I wasn't sure how the Padres were using their bullpen, for example, I could go through a month of Padres box scores, and I would know. I remember in 1993, right about the start of the steroid era, counting by hand the number of players that had gotten four extra-base hits in a game that season. The search took from Dallas to San Francisco. I couldn't have done that on my computer on a plane. It was more satisfying than reading Sky Mall magazine.
But now, it's over. Now I read the box scores most days on ESPN.com on my computer. I'm not comfortable doing it but I have no other choice. I have saved time, as well as money on scotch tape and scissors. Since 9/11, I estimate having lost at least six pair of scissors because I forgot to remove them from my bag and the security men and women at airports thought I might hijack the plane using scissors as dull as NFL preseason games.
But I still read box scores with the same vigor and interest every day for there is so much to learn in box scores, almost everything you need is in box scores, especially with the expanded ones that tell you, in some cases, more than you wanted to know. Twice a year, I have lunch and talk baseball with George Will and Dr. Charles Krauthammer, who write and speak about important issues in the world, such as war and gay marriage. At one lunch, Krauthammer said, "I read the front page for 30 seconds every day, then I go straight to the box scores.'' To which Will said, "Why do you waste the 30 seconds?''
Former major league manager Gene Mauch once showed me how to determine which player made the last out of a game by reading a box score, calculating the at-bats, runners left on base, double plays, etc. Mauch had better things to do, yet that fascinated him, so it fascinated me that one of the most brilliant managing minds in baseball history would sit at breakfast and determine that Dan Ford made the last out of an Orioles-Royals game.
The box scores start every day for me because there's always a chance you'll see a pitching or batting line that you've never seen before, and might never see again, such as Ben Petrick's 3-0-0-4 a few years ago. Four RBIs without a hit! "I thought I had a bad day,'' Petrick said, "until I looked at the box score.'' The box score is where we once saw the battery for the Tigers of Glenn Abbott and Marty Castillo -- Abbott and Castillo -- and the Giants' famed Bud Black-Steve Decker battery -- Black and Decker, of which great writer Steve Rushin wrote: Decker wore "the power tools of ignorance.''

The box scores start every day for me because there's always a chance you'll see a pitching or batting line that you've never seen before, and might never see again.

In the upper left-hand drawer of the desk in my office, I keep the box score from the Rangers' 30-3 victory over the Orioles on Aug. 22, 2007, because it was historic in so many ways, including the batting line of the eighth and ninth hitters for the Rangers: Saltalamacchia 6-5-4-7 and Vazquez 6-4-4-7. And I can still remember John Kruk laughing at me in the background as I made a complete fool of myself on national TV when I could not control my enthusiasm at the sight of a box score never seen before in baseball history.
This year, like every year, has been filled with great box-score items, including one from Wednesday night when the Red Sox, for the first time in their history, got a home run from their first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman in the same game. Also this year, the White Sox became the first team to use five pitchers in a game and all five recorded three strikeouts. The Blue Jays got home runs from Jose Bautista, John Buck and Travis Snider, the first time in Toronto's 34-year history that its 7-8-9 hitters homered in the same game. Chase Utley, Shane Victorino and Ryan Zimmerman homered in the same game, the first time that players with the last name starting with U, V and Z did so in the same game. And Gavin Floyd started against Brian Bannister, the first Floyd-Bannister pitching matchup; Floyd Bannister is, of course, Brian Bannister's father.
I still devour box scores every day, making sure to check, among other things, that the Mets' Angel Pagan didn't get hit by a pitch: He has never been hit by a pitch in his major league career. The difference is, I just don't cut the box scores out anymore and tape them in a book like a fifth-grader doing a current events project. I don't miss the black ink on my fingers, I don't miss lugging around a notebook as thick as a phone book and I don't miss the looks of disbelief from my wife that a grown man would do such a stupid thing for 20 years.
But there are still days that I reach for my box-score book and it's not there. And I miss it.

CARY, N.C. -- Bryce Harper recently announced he will take his GED, leave high school after two years and enroll at the College of Southern Nevada this fall. This should make the Las Vegas High School catcher eligible for the 2010 Rule 4 draft, when he'd be the overwhelming favorite to be the No. 1 overall pick.
This move -- expected among major league scouts and team executives since last summer -- has raised all manner of questions and stirred up controversy over who is making the decisions for Harper and whether he is making the right move.
Playing on Tuesday at the Tournament of Stars event held at USA Baseball's stunning complex, Harper is the nation's best high school player right now. The same was true a year ago, when he exploded onto the scene at the Area Code Games as a rising freshman, a 15-year-old facing and dominating competitors who were mostly 17 and 18. He's been hitting against older competitors for years; Harper has earned invitations to play on travel teams of older players since he was 10 years old.
He's played in prestigious events, including the Area Code Games -- which he called the biggest baseball challenge he's faced and a "phenomenal experience" -- and on the national team in the age 16 and under division. He's a potential five-tool talent who plays the most difficult position on the field. He puts on a display in batting practice, launching balls out to right field with a sound so loud it leaves bystanders looking for the shattered-bat remnants.
One problem extremely talented prep players like Harper can face is the lack of a challenge. Harper has had no trouble hitting against high school pitchers in Nevada or in summer ball, and in high school he finds himself pitched around frequently.
"High school was a great experience for two years, I loved it," Harper said Tuesday. "I just want to get out of there where I'm getting walked 40, 50 times a year."
His father, Ron, put it more bluntly: "I think his overall average was around .630 with the playoffs, and [he] didn't really get pitched to; that's not a lot of fun for him. There's a lot of frustration there."
Budget cuts in Nevada have made matters worse, according to Ron Harper, reducing the regular season for Las Vegas High to 18 games. At the College of Southern Nevada, Harper will be able to play 60 games, and will do it in a more challenging environment.
"College is going to push him academically, and also on the field it's going to push him," Ron Harper said. "He's going to play a lot of older guys, bigger guys, stronger guys, for 60 games."
At CSN, Harper will play in one of the top junior college baseball programs in the country. The 2009 nonconference schedule included games against most of the major two-year programs, including Central Arizona, San Jacinto (Texas), Miami-Dade and Chipola (Fla.). The school also uses wood bats, which should ease the transition into pro ball. Harper prefers wood bats -- "I've always wanted to swing the wood. If I could have swung the wood in high school, I would have" -- but couldn't use them in high school games.
Harper's readiness on the baseball field, at least for the jump to junior college, isn't really in question. His readiness for the emotional or mental challenges to come is more difficult to ascertain, although to his credit he recognizes that at some point he's going to fail.
"There's always going to be failure; baseball's a game of failure," he said. "If you K, you can't go back on that game and say, 'Oh, crap, I went 0-for-4.' There's a million more games to play. You've got to get better, you've got to progress. You can't say, 'Well, I K'd that game so I'll just quit.' It's a team game; as long as your guys won, that's what matters."
As for the increasing pressure as he moves up the baseball ladder, Harper isn't concerned.
"I love pressure," he says. "If there is any pressure on me, I thrive on it. Two outs, bottom of the ninth, I want to be that guy. We played Cuba last year, in the 16U [age 16 and under] championships. I came in the last inning. I pitched. It was the biggest pressure of my life -- don't lose the game for the USA -- but it was awesome, a great experience. I've had pressure on me since I was 8 years old."
Ron Harper has come under fire for what some members of the media argue is a dereliction of his parental duty. Bryce is still a minor, and Ron has ultimate responsibility for his son. Ron says he's happy to take the criticism if it allows Bryce to concentrate on playing, and for his part, argues that this was a family decision.
"I said, 'Are you sure you want to do all this? It's OK -- you can always go back to high school'," Ron said. "But he said, 'No, Dad, I want to do it. I want to do it.' And people say, well, you're the adult, you need to make that decision for him, but he's a pretty mature kid, and he's a good kid, and the level of baseball that he's been playing at, and the level of school he's been at, he needs to be pushed. And I believe that, and my wife and the coaches and the whole staff from the HS believe it too."
If Bryce wants to take this step, and all indications are that he is ready to do so, why would his father stand in his son's way?
In fact, much of the hue and cry over Harper's plan to leave high school two years early is rubbish. If Harper is eligible for the 2010 draft after his first year of junior college -- and he should be, although Ron indicated he has yet to receive a "100 percent answer" on that question from MLB -- he'll be 17 years and almost eight months old on draft day. That would make him just two months younger than Mike Trout and Randal Grichuk were June 9, when they were selected in the first round of the 2009 draft. The Marlins' third-round pick, Da'Shon Cooper, is one year to the day older than Harper. None of their fathers were criticized for allowing their sons to enter pro ball at such a young age.
Inevitably, there's also a backlash in the scouting community, among the same scouts who dropped what they were doing at the 2008 Area Code Games to watch every one of Harper's at-bats. On Tuesday, when one scout learned I was writing a piece about Harper, he said "Don't feed the machine," referring to the tremendous hype that already surrounds the player.
It's perfectly natural for a talented player like Bryce Harper to want to be challenged further when he has already shown he has mastered his current level. It's not the place for anyone, including MLB or the media, to deny him the chance to succeed or fail at a higher level of play. The smart money is on him succeeding.

Father's Day is more than a month away, but why wait until mid-June to learn more about 2005's most improved hitter, Brian Roberts?
For those who don't know, Brian is the son of former University of North Carolina baseball coach Mike Roberts. When Brian was still nursing, Mike took over as the Tar Heels' coach and led them to a third-place finish at the College World Series in 1978. The following summer, on a family vacation, baby Brian contracted pneumonia, which produced a heart defect that required open-heart surgery when he was just 5 years old. By then, B.J. Surhoff was playing for the Tar Heels, and all he remembers is that one spring, the little kid who was hanging around all the time wasn't there anymore.
Despite the setback and lack of stamina, little Brian returned to hanging out with his dad's team the following season, watching the likes of Surhoff, Scott Bradley, Walt Weiss, and later Scott Bankhead and Paul Shuey. Eventually, Roberts joined them in the UNC record books as college freshman of the year in 1997 and ACC player of the year in 1998, setting school records for hits and steals in a season.
When Mike Roberts was let go after 21 seasons in Chapel Hill after that 1998 season, Brian transferred to South Carolina, where in 1999 he again led the nation in steals. The Orioles drafted Brian Roberts in the first round. His dad went on to coach at UNC-Asheville and currently coaches the Cotuit Kettleers in the Cape Cod League. A former All-ACC catcher, Mike Roberts is a master at what it takes to have stolen base success. He even hired the Carolina track coach to work with Brian in his collegiate days.
So how much of Brian's hard-earned success in 2005, seven years after he last played under his father, is still owed to his upbringing? During a recent rain delay in Boston, we talked about it.
Clubhouse Confidential: "How has your relationship with your father changed over time as you developed as a ballplayer?"
Brian Roberts: "Greatly. ... He was my dad, but he was also my coach, 100 percent, all the way, from day one until probably a couple of years ago, and it was difficult at times. Anybody who's had the father-son/coach-dad relationship knows how it can be good at times and it can be hard at times. When we were in college, I think it helped a lot because we finally got to be around each other more than we probably were for a while when I was in high school. ... But then when I left and went to pro ball, that was when it got kind of hard because he still wanted to coach a lot. And he wasn't around me that much, so he didn't really ... it's hard ... I know where he's coming from, because when I struggled, he hurt for me and he wanted to try and help, but at that point I was just kind of frustrated with the whole dad/coach thing. And it got to the point where I said, 'Dad, I just want you to enjoy this. Enjoy my career. You helped me get here, now kind of let me go on my own and see what happens.' "
Clubhouse Confidential: "Did that end it or are there still times when he ...?"
Roberts: (laughs) "It took a long time. A lot of conversations. You know, I think it takes time to change any relationship, whatever it might be. And when you have somebody who cares that much about you like your dad does, it makes it that much more difficult. But, it's gotten a lot better over the last couple of years and myself getting a chance to play every day, and go through ups and downs. I mean, he played pro ball, so he knows a little bit about what it's all about. But you switch from college and playing 60 games to go into 160 ... when you're in college, you don't go through the 0-for-15s very often, or ever.  I was fortunate. I didn't go through a whole lot of that in college, so he got frustrated, I got frustrated and it kind of strained our relationship for a while. But it's working now, where he enjoys watching me play and we can just have a dad/son relationship."
Clubhouse Confidential: "Was that tough growing up that you felt like he always related to you and you always related to him in terms of baseball?"
Roberts: "I was on Cal Ripken's show the other day, and he expressed some of the same interests. I mean his dad was his coach in the big leagues, so I think any time your dad has been a coach and it's in his blood and that's what he loves, that's what it's going to be for a long time. I still go to him, but for the most part I said, 'OK, this is a time in my life where I want to develop a better relationship personally with my dad.' It's not worth it at this point because I'm surrounded by great coaches and great veterans, like when Cal was here, and so many other guys that you can lean on for help. I know what my dad would tell me by heart. I could recite everything he was going to tell me. I just said, 'You don't have to tell me, I already know.'"
Clubhouse Confidential: "I know you were very young when it happened, but what do you recall of the time you went through open-heart surgery, and your relationship then, and how it may have changed things?"
Roberts:  "Yeah, I was only 5, so I don't remember a lot about it. One of the memories I have is being wheeled off into the operating room and how hard that was for myself and my parents. I can remember holding on to both of them crying and just not wanting to leave because I probably didn't comprehend what was going on with the surgery at that point, obviously. But my parents did, sure, and any time you send a child into an operation, especially open-heart surgery at age 5, it's a difficult thing. I think he learned at that point that life was more important than anything else, especially with your children. The most important thing is that your child's healthy, and so to get through that, it probably helped a lot."

A vocal group of A's enthusiasts were seated just up the first-base line in section 111 of the Metrodome while Oakland won three of four in Minnesota recently. That's where dozens of family members and friends of Oakland rookie Dan Johnson, a local product, were holding fort.
According to A's traveling secretary Mickey Morabito, Johnson had to hit up his teammates for their tickets to accommodate all the requests from Coon Rapids, Minn At $34 a pop, Johnson's IRS liability for his benevolence comes to more than $600 of taxable income. In addition, Dan's dad, Ron, bought 100 extra tickets of his own. Good thing he's a mortgage banker because he may need an extra mortgage or two to pay for the privilege.
Dan didn't dissapoint, homering twice in the series, and scoring the winning run in the second game. It wasn't the first time Johnson had played or homered in the Metrodome, but it was the first time it didn't occur in the middle of the night. Because Minnesota's weather is brutal in the spring, most high school teams only get to play about a dozen games.
During his senior year, Johnson's Blaine High School baseball team rented out the Metrodome for a game, but the only time the baseball team could have access was 2 a.m., and only half the lights were on in a building where it's already tough to see flyballs. Johnson's high school team played a live game in front of close friends and family, and Johnson homered. And just like that night eight years ago, he returned to his old bedroom in Coon Rapids. This time, though, the bed was too small and he was sharing the room with his wife and baby boy.
Johnson had a similar problem at the A's next stop in Kansas City, the closest city to his wife's relatives in Nebraska and to his old pals in Lincoln, where he played for the University of Nebraska. Johnson said he wasn't aware of how many supporters were in the crowd at Kauffman Stadium, but he was 0-for-5 Sunday, ending a four-game home run streak and a 10-game hitting streak.
Balancing act
Johnson is the latest in a line of superb products from the A's farm system, along with fellow rookie Nick Swisher, the leading candidate to succeed teammate Bobby Crosby as American League Rookie of the Year. There's a direct parallel between the A's eruption from a dismal start and Crosby's return from the disabled list on May 30. Since then the A's have gone from 15 games under .500 to a tie for the division lead with the Angels, who visit Oakland for a three-game series beginning Tuesday.
Unlike last year when he hit seventh or eighth in the order, Crosby has moved up to the pivotal three hole and asserted himself by going to the opposite field more. But it was more by necessity rather than design. When the season began, lefty Mark Kotsay was the leadoff man, and -- except for righty Jason Kendall -- there was an endless stream of left-handed batters in Eric Chavez, Erubiel Durazo, Scott Hatteberg, and the switch-hitting Swisher. With Crosby in the three hole, and Kendall moved to the top, there's now a perfect left/right balance in the lineup.
Catching on
For the third straight season, manager Ken Macha has a new catcher (Kendall) handling his pitching staff, one that includes only Barry Zito from the original "Big Three" of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Zito. In Macha's first season as A's manager, his backstop was Ramon Hernandez, who was Macha's "personal project." Macha, former major-league catcher, was able to mold Hernandez to the point where he knew every pitch that would be called.
Last season they brought in Damian Miller, who was instrumental in the development of Rich Harden. Like Hernandez, Kendall was brought in for his offense. While he's struggled to throw out runners, his marriage with the young staff and holdover Zito, as well as his aggressiveness in defending home plate and running the bases, has been a perfect fit for Oakland.
Macha also appreciates Kendall's aggressiveness with some of his young pitchers. On a team littered with players suffering back ailments, Joe Blanton was laboring through a recent start, and holding his back at times. Kendall went to the mound to see if everything was all right. When Blanton said his back was fine, Kendall barked at him, "Then why don't you start throwing the ball like it then?" And he did.
Spirited group
When Torii Hunter went down in a heap at Fenway Park 10 days ago, the Twins not only lost the most feared bat in the middle of the lineup, but a Gold Glove defender, and the spirit of the franchise. Hunter's effervesence, even in the throes of their drought, kept the team from ever losing hope. Hunter's dazzling, perpetual smile has been replaced by a hard cast and crutches, and teammates like Jacque Jones, Mike Redmond, Matthew LeCroy and Silva are left to raise the optimism in his absence.
It's one thing the franchise has always possessed, back to the championship teams of Puckett, Hrbek, Viola, Gladden, Brunansky, and Blyleven -- boyish mischievousness even in the face of doom. Witness Silva's pregame serenade during their six-game skid, or how he was replaced with an inflatable, well, replacement in the annual team picture while he was warming up that night. It doesn't hurt to have a manager like Ron Gardenhire or coaches like Al Newman, a teammate of those past Twins' pranksters, to help keep things loose.
This is a sample subhead
Minnesota had grown so desperate for runs before a pair of outbursts against Boston that starting pitcher Brad Radke called out Newman for not sending runners more liberally from his third-base coaching box.  Rather than starting an internal incident, Newman responded to the dropped gauntlet by telling his runners, "OK, that's it, you guys are getting sent to the guillotine. From now on, everyone gets waved."
What makes it even tougher for the Twins to score, especially with Hunter out, is that the plodding Justin Morneau is far from the slowest guy on the team. Save for Shannon Stewart and Jones, they're all pretty much station-to-station guys, and when Matthew LeCroy recently decided to go from first to third on a single, he looked at the third-base box only to see Newman with his hands over his eyes. By the way, he was safe.
Boone swoon
Twins GM Terry Ryan hoped Bret Boone could rekindle some of his past magic after the Mariners released him, but he was even worse as a Twin. He wanted to hit third, insisted his only position was second base, and expected to be in the lineup everyday. But he never got an extra-base hit as a Twin, barely worked on his defensive routines and didn't assimiliate to new teammates.
On the plane back from Boston, he was told the team would be making a move with him. His career at a crossroads, the three-time All-Star will immerse himself in some intensive swing therapy with his dad Bob, and contemplate a return with someone else, either before Sept. 1 or next spring, or face the possibility of retirement.
Hall picks for '06
The inductions of Ryne Sandberg and Wade Boggs into the Baseball Hall of Fame drew one of the largest and most spirited gatherings ever in Cooperstown. But 2006 may be the first year since 1996 when no one is voted into the regular Hall of Fame. The first-time eligibles are led by Orel Hershiser, Will Clark and Doc Gooden. That may mean longtime holdovers Goose Gossage, Bruce Sutter and Bert Blyleven could finally get the necessary votes, and the Veterans Committee could reward Gil Hodges and Ron Santo with their rightful inclusion into the Hall next summer.

Instead of going forward with a perjury and obstruction of justice trial against Barry Bonds on Monday, federal prosecutors in San Francisco decided Friday to appeal rulings that excluded much of their evidence. Last week, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the prosecutors would not be permitted to use three positive drug tests, drug calendars, drug cycle logs and invoices in support of their charge that Bonds lied to a grand jury about his use of steroids. The prosecutors' action raises a number of legal questions. Here are some of the questions and their answers:
After six years of investigation and preparation for the trial, why would the prosecutors delay everything with an appeal?
Judge Illston's rulings were devastating for the prosecutors. Proof of perjury is always difficult, and Illston's rulings left the prosecutors with serious problems. If they went to trial with the evidence that remained, they would have been in a precarious position. Bonds easily could have walked away with a not-guilty verdict at the end of the trial. To preserve their chances of convicting Bonds, the prosecutors decided to test Illston's rulings in a higher court, hoping the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will overrule Illston and allow them to use all of the evidence they have gathered in their massive investigation.
What are the prosecutors' chances for success on appeal?
Their chances are good. Many legal experts were surprised by Illston's rulings. The prosecutors offered clever and creative arguments for the use of their evidence. The major obstacle, of course, was personal trainer Greg Anderson's refusal to testify against Bonds. If he had agreed to testify, the use of the evidence would have been simple and routine. But without Anderson's testimony, the prosecution had problems in meeting the requirements of the rules that govern evidence in federal courts. Relying on a series of rules that allow evidence to be presented even though it is hearsay, the prosecutors seemed to have met the legal requirement for use of the evidence. Illston, however, disagreed. Was she correct? The higher court will decide, but it looks good for the prosecutors.
Was this a surprise?
No. Several months ago, when the agents and prosecutors realized that Anderson would never testify for them, they embarked on a process that led to this appeal. They could have waited until the trial was underway to learn whether they would succeed in using the drug tests and the other evidence. But they knew going in that the evidence would present problems. Instead of waiting, they obtained an agreement from Bonds' legal team to allow Judge Illston to examine the evidence before the trial. In retrospect, it was a smart move by the government. The federal prosecutors are permitted to appeal an adverse ruling on matters such as the drug tests if the ruling is made before the trial. In the patois of the courthouse, the procedure is known as a "3731." If they had waited until the trial was underway to try to present the evidence in question, they would have lost their chance for an appeal under the rules of double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is not a game. It is a provision of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees everyone that they can be accused of a crime once and only once. If the prosecutors had lost in the trial, they would not be given a second chance. Because they anticipated the problems caused by Anderson's refusal to testify, the prosecutors are now able to pursue this appeal in a final attempt to preserve their case against Bonds.
Is this just a delaying tactic by the federal prosecutors? Aren't they merely prolonging their campaign against Bonds?
Some observers believe the appeal is an attempt at delay and a sign of weakness from the prosecutors. Professor Peter Keane of Golden Gate University Law School calls the appeal "stupid" and "foolish" and suggests the government should be ready for trial. (See story here.) But the delay is not the result of the government's appeal or any other government actions. The delays are the direct result of Anderson's stubborn refusal to tell what he knows about Bonds and his use of steroids. If Anderson had been willing to tell the grand jury and the nation what he knew about Bonds, the entire process would have ended two or three years ago. Bonds' lawyers claim that the appeal is prolonging a campaign against an innocent man. If Bonds is innocent, why won't Anderson tell what he knows about Bonds and BALCO? The government's appeal is based on the prosecutors' faith in the integrity of their charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. They are convinced that Bonds is guilty of a serious crime. It is their duty to gather and to present proof of the crime. To prove the crime, they created a strategy for circumventing Anderson's refusal to tell the truth; they argued it before Judge Illston; and now they are testing the accuracy of her rulings. Who is hurt by the time consumed in the appeal? If Bonds is doing anything to help and to support Anderson, Bonds now knows that he will be doing it for at least as long as the appeal continues.
Is this a significant development in the BALCO saga?
Yes. The decision to appeal shows that the administration of President Barack Obama will continue with the steroids enforcement policy that began under President George W. Bush. The prosecutors in San Francisco could not have filed this appeal without the approval of Eric Holder, the new attorney general, and Elena Kagan, the new solicitor general; so the decision to file the appeal was made at the highest level. Although many progressives have criticized the BALCO probe, it is now clear that the Obama administration will pursue steroids issues. The decision to appeal is a clear signal that federal steroids investigations are far from over.

Back in the late winter of 1941, a skinny, 20-year-old pitcher named Stan Musial showed up at the St. Louis Cardinals' spring training camp with an aching arm and diminishing hopes that he would ever fulfill his youthful dream of making it to the big leagues.
Musial, who died Saturday at the age of 92, had come up as an erratic, wild-throwing southpaw -- so wild, in fact, that a scouting report at one point urged his release -- in the Cards' minor league system in 1938. His prospects grew only darker in August 1940 in Orlando, Fla., when he was chasing a fly ball in the outfield and his cleats got caught in the turf. He fell hard on the point of his left shoulder, the one to which his pitching arm was attached. With his shoulder injured, he lost the pop on his fastball, and Cardinals hitters began teeing off on him. He later remembered throwing one pitch to his boyhood idol, Cards star center fielder Terry Moore, and then hearing the crack of the bat and watching the ball carry out of the park.
Discouraged as he was, the young man did not quit. As fate would have it, on a day Cards legendary general manager Branch Rickey was watching an intrasquad game in Hollywood, Fla., Musial himself hit a ponderous home run over the right-field fence. This turned out to be, for the Cards as a team and baseball in general, a wonderfully propitious moment. Musial's arm never did completely heal; but at the end of camp, when Rickey heard some sentiment among coaches to send the kid packing, he waved those voices away.
No one in the annals of the game knew young talent like the Mahatma, as Rickey was known. He saw the kind of potential in young Musial that he one day would see in Jackie Robinson, when he was general manager of the Dodgers and sought to integrate baseball; in a minor league outfielder in Montreal named Roberto Clemente, whom he shamelessly picked from the Dodgers' pocket after he left Brooklyn for Pittsburgh; and in an aspiring young shortstop named Bill Mazeroski, whom he saw turn a few plays at second base, also when he was general manager of the Pirates. "Don't move him," Rickey told Maz's coaches. "He stays at second." The Mahatma thus launched Maz on a career that turned him into a fielder baseball historian Bill James has called "probably the greatest defensive player of all time."
So when Rickey heard talk that sore-armed Stanley ought to be released, he ordered the kid sent to the Cards' Class C affiliate in Springfield, Mo.
"Don't let him go," the Mahatma said. "Put him in the outfield and see if he can hit."
This was, as things turned out, a declaration worthy of enshrinement in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, right next to the plaque honoring Musial himself. Indeed, over the next two decades, his physical presence in the batter's box left a lasting impression on all who saw him stroke a baseball with a wooden bat.
His stance was singular. Musial stood slightly crouched -- "I started to crouch because that way I could guard the plate better," he once said -- with his bat straight up, his feet close together and his shoulders turned so far to the left that the pitcher, Lord help him, could read the "6" on Musial's back. He had learned as a kid how to go with a pitch and how to slap the ball to left field, a talent that gave him an enormous edge and, as can be imagined, drove opposing fielders to distraction unto despair. Managers forever were flummoxed as to how to defend against him. Early in the season of 1951, not long after 20-year-old Willie Mays first was called up to the New York Giants, manager Leo Durocher met with the young slugger to go over the opposing hitters for that day. The Giants were playing the St. Louis Cardinals, and Durocher briefed Mays on the Cards' lineup, telling Mays how to play the first hitter, then the second hitter and then the fourth hitter.
"What about number three?" Mays asked.
"The third hitter is Stan Musial," Durocher told him. "There is no advice I can give you about him."
What complicated things for Durocher and fellow skippers was the fact that Musial was fast on his feet. Stretching singles into doubles or doubles into triples, he could hit another gear on the basepaths, prompting one manager to liken Musial at full gallop to "a wounded turkey." They nicknamed him the "Donora Greyhound," a reference to his hometown in Pennsylvania.
Blessed with such an array of talents, Musial became not only one of the dozen or so greatest hitters in the annals of baseball, but he also was clearly the finest left-handed batter who ever graced a box in the National League. In the course of his surpassing career, he hung up such prodigious numbers that James, the eminent guru and muncher of baseball stats, ranked him at the end of the 20th century as the 10th greatest player of all time.
In his 2000 edition of Baseball Abstract, James put Musial behind Babe Ruth (1), who was followed in order by Honus Wagner, Willie Mays, Oscar Charleston, Ty Cobb, Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Walter Johnson and Josh Gibson. Musial was next, directly ahead of such indubitable lights as Tris Speaker (11), Hank Aaron (12), Joe DiMaggio (13) and Lou Gehrig (14), with Mike Schmidt (21), Rogers Hornsby (22) and Frank Robinson (24) further back.
Musial retired at the end of the 1963 season, but nearly a half-century later, he still is second in total bases with 6,134, behind Aaron (6,856) and just ahead of Mays (6,066). No active ballplayer is even close, and Musial left the game well ahead of Cobb, Ruth, Pete Rose and Carl Yastrzemski.
In the realm of all-time leaders, Musial is fourth in hits with 3,630, sixth in RBIs with 1,951, ninth in runs scored with 1,949, third in extra-base hits with 1,377, third in doubles with 725 and tied for 19th (with Rabbit Maranville) in triples, although again, it is only fair to point out that 10 of those ahead of him in three-baggers began their careers when triples were as plentiful as buffalo, and no less endangered, in the years immediately following Custer's Last Stand.
His ratio of at-bats to strikeouts also is among the best in the history of the majors. Here is one you would not have guessed: Musial had 3,266 more at-bats than Williams but 13 fewer strikeouts (696 for Musial, 709 for Williams), and Williams owned a pair of the most famously discriminating batting eyes in the game. And while Musial ranks 28th in home runs, tied with Willie Stargell at 475, his true place in that pantheon is difficult to fathom in the wake of the recent orgies of chemical enhancement.
All that said, the combined weights of the Musial numbers bear James out, and they certainly give powerful affirmation to those many voices along the Mississippi Valley that have been crying for years that Stan was The Man. So it always has been something of a mystery why Musial -- as generous and decent a man off the field as he was brilliant and dependable on it -- has spent so many years sunk in the shadows of baseball history, a giant often either forgotten or dismissed whenever the sports-talk junkies summon the names of baseball's finest hitters and all-around players.
This unwarranted neglect has become manifest at the game's grassroots. When Sports Illustrated had fans pick a 20th century all-star team at the end of the millennium, they voted Musial 10th among outfielders.  ESPN television failed to put him among the top 50 athletes of the 20th century. When MasterCard and professional baseball assembled their All-Century team in 1999, the voting masses virtually ignored Musial; ultimately, an "oversight committee" slipped him onto the roster.
No doubt these embarrassing instances of poor judgment can be traced, at least in part, to the town Musial called home. He played baseball out of St. Louis, not New York, and he did so mostly in an era when that burg was as far west as baseball reached, on the near edge of the American wilderness known as the Great Plains. No one wrote songs about him. No one penned lyrics invoking his name. No character in a Hemingway novel ever mused about him. And no one made a movie of his life. He often visited the media capital of America, but he never was a creation or a creature of it.
Musial had neither the flair nor the flamboyance of Willie Mays.
No basket catches by Stanley.
He did not crush 500-foot home runs over the white walls of the Bronx, recalling the titanic shots of Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx.
No swilling beer from a bucket for Musial. No swallowing hot dogs in two bites, no open roadsters, no raccoon coats.
Nor did Stanley have Mickey Mantle's awesome speed and ambidextrous power.
He never got into a single drunken brawl at the Copacabana.
In fact, through the 3,026 games he played in his career, he never got kicked out of one. Not a single game. Ken Burkhart umpired scores of St. Louis games behind the plate and said Musial never once complained to him about one of his calls, not even one of those hair-splitting called strikes that might have gone either way.
"In seven years, he never even turned his head to look at me when I was behind the plate," Burkhart said.
Nor did he marry the blond movie star with the dress billowing above the subway vent, and he never insisted on being introduced at old-timers' games as "the greatest living ballplayer," although you could make a far stronger case for him than you could for Joe D.
No, Musial married the grocer's daughter from Donora, a shot-and-a-beer mill town that lay some 28 miles south of Pittsburgh, on the banks of the Monongahela River. He grew up, one of a family of eight, in a five-room, wood-frame house at the top of a hill. His father, Lukasz, a Polish immigrant, worked in a zinc factory. A hanging blanket of sulfurous fumes killed all the vegetation on the hill and eventually the old man, too. Lillian Labash, the grocer's daughter, first saw Musial in Palmer Park when he was a 14-year-old lad working as a bat boy for the team of zinc workers managed by a neighbor, Joe Barbao. That day, they were playing another team of blue collars from nearby Monessen. Barbao had run out of pitchers, according to the late sportswriter W.C. Heinz, so he threw young Musial into the fray. Musial pitched six innings and fanned 13 hitters.
"Look at that Polish kid pitch against those men," the grocer said to his daughter.
Lillian and Stanley were married five years later -- on his 19th birthday, Nov. 21, 1939 -- when he was making $65 a month pitching for the Cardinals' Class D minor league team in Williamson, W.Va. At 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, Musial always had been able to hit the ball, a skill he had been practicing since he was a boy. "I learned to hit with a broomstick and a ball of tape, and I could always get that bat on the ball," he said.
It did not take Rickey long to learn how right he had been about giving the kid a chance. At Springfield, in just 87 games, Musial hit 26 home runs and had a whopping 94 runs batted in -- a glorious harbinger of his baseball life. After having hit at an equally torrid clip with the Cards' Double-A Rochester club, Musial was home in Donora in mid-September 1941 when he got that unforgettable telegram. It was from Rickey, ordering him to report to the mother club.
"It was really something," Musial told Heinz. "Imagine a 20-year-old kid who starts the year pitching with a sore arm and can't tell if he's gonna make it anywhere in organized ball and ends up "
 Stepping into the St. Louis clubhouse for the first time in his life and immediately running into Terry Moore, that outfielder who had been his boyhood idol.
Moore looked at him quizzically. "You look familiar," he said.
"I ought to," Musial said. "You hit a homer off me in an exhibition game this spring."
"Are you that humpty-dumpty, bum-armed kid?" Moore said. "How'd you get way up here?"
That was the question in the Cards' clubhouse that afternoon, and it took Musial no time at all to answer it. That day against the Boston Braves, in his first major league game, he found himself face to face with a knuckleballer, Jim Tobin. Musial had never seen a knuckler, and he sliced under the first one for a popup out. Tobin later tried to fool the rookie again, fluttering up another knuckler, but this time, Musial lashed it for a double to right, scoring two runs to help win the game 3-2.
Musial had 20 hits in 47 at-bats that month, including four doubles and a home run, and ended up hitting .426. He went 6-for-10 in a double-header against the Cubs, leaving Chicago manager Jimmy Wilson to wonder aloud, "Nobody can be that good." Also during that month, the Cards visited the Braves in Boston, and after they left town, the Dodgers showed up, on their way to winning the pennant. Casey Stengel, then the Braves' manager, greeted the Brooklyn writers with this: "Your fellas will win it, but those Cardinals got a young kid in left field that you guys are gonna be writin' about for 20 years."
Leave it to Casey to call that shot, almost to the year. Rarely has baseball seen a more sustained display of excellence, consistency and class than in the 22 years Stanley Frank Musial played baseball. Beyond that brief debut in 1941, he hit no less than .310 for 16 consecutive seasons, a span during which his batting average was .340 and as high as .376 in 1948, his signature year: 230 hits, 46 doubles, 18 triples, 39 home runs, 135 runs, 131 RBIs. It was the year the Phillies' new manager, Eddie Sawyer, was asked what he thought of the National League teams.
"Of all the teams I've seen so far," Sawyer said, "Musial is the best."
It also was the year he won one of his seven batting titles and one of his three MVP awards. By then, he was so feared by pitchers that they began to joke about how they pitched to him.
The Brooklyn Dodgers' pinpoint control specialist, Preacher Roe, once said of Musial: "I throw four wide ones to him and then try to pick him off first."
"I've had pretty good success with Musial by throwing him my best pitch and backing up third," the Dodgers' Carl Erskine said.
As humble as he was, shy to a fault, Musial felt utterly at home between the chalk lines. No one had more confidence in him than he had in himself. In the 1955 All-Star Game, with the score knotted in the bottom of the 12th inning, Musial came to the plate and was greeted by a very tired Yogi Berra, who was catching that day.
"My feet are killing me," Yogi said to Musial.
"Relax," Musial said, "I'll have you home in a minute."
He homered into the seats, winning the game. In fact, the homer became one of a record six he hit for the National League in All-Star Games.
Before doubleheaders, shirtless and dressed in only his flannel pants, he would walk around the Cards' clubhouse squeezing the handle of his bat and saying, to no one in particular, "Stanley could have 10 hits today. It is possible for Stanley to have 10 hits. Ten hits for Stanley!" In fact, in one doubleheader, he hit a record six home runs.
And as often as he hurt the Dodgers, they never booed him in Brooklyn, where he became so inspired he seemed to enter a whole new zone as a hitter.
"There was always excitement in Brooklyn," Musial once said. "My adrenaline was always flowing in Ebbets Field. The tension, the atmosphere, the fights -- you knew something was going to happen.  The ballpark was small, so the seats were close to the field, and you could hear just about anything anybody said."
Musial heard plenty in those summers of 1948 and 1949, when he hit .522 in Ebbets Field and appeared, like "The Natural," able to do almost anything he wanted with the bat. It was where they coined his other nickname. "I'd come to the plate and the fans would say, 'Here comes that man again, that man.' A sportswriter picked it up and it became 'Stan the Man.'"
It also was the era when Jackie Robinson integrated baseball, and with Robinson's arrival, the game became rife with rumors that some players were planning to boycott any games involving the Dodgers. The hottest of these beds was St. Louis, where there were a number of Southern players. But Musial openly backed Robinson, and the Cards never voted to strike. Musial had played with and against blacks in high school, and among his teammates was Buddy Griffey -- later the father of Ken Griffey Sr. and the grandfather of Ken Griffey Jr. "I didn't give it a second thought," Musial said.
Indeed. When another black player, Joe Black, came up to play in Brooklyn five years later, in 1952, racial slurs still were being heard in baseball. In one game, with Black on the mound, Musial was in the box and set to hit when he heard one of his own teammates shout from the dugout, "Don't worry, Stan. With that dark background on the mound, you shouldn't have any trouble hitting the ball." After the game, Black was dressing in the Brooklyn clubhouse when Musial sidled up to him.
"I'm sorry that happened," Musial said quietly. "But don't you worry about it. You're a great pitcher. You'll win a lot of games."
His baseball prowess aside, Musial was first all-time in decency, affability and charm. He had endless patience for signing autographs, and if he happened to spot a table of little old ladies at a restaurant, celebrating someone's 80th, he would pull from a pocket his well-used harmonica and serenade them with a chorus of "Happy Birthday." He would follow this with a few bars of "The Wabash Cannonball" and finish the show by playing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."
Musial always described himself as a retiring man who shied from public appearances, particularly if they involved giving speeches, but he was perfectly at home in social gatherings and loved to party. For years, he was the central schmoozer and greeter at his famous St. Louis restaurant, Stan Musial and Biggie's, serving as the city's informal host in the same way Jack Dempsey served New York from a table at his famous Times Square eatery. He was no shirking violet when it came to public celebrations. One day in 1986, in the week before the Bears-Patriots Super Bowl in New Orleans, a young sportswriter was sitting in a bar in the French Quarter when, suddenly, a conga line came dancing off the street and through the bar. It snaked past the table of the sportswriter, who thought he had to be seeing things through a beery mist. There was Musial, then 65 years old, dancing at the head of the line as he blew the throbbing conga tune from his harmonica.
By this time, of course, Musial long had been an institution in St. Louis -- not only as a Hall of Fame baseball player, but as a roving, sometimes dancing, ambassador for the Cards' franchise, his adopted city and the sport of professional baseball. He visited his father's native Poland several times since 1970, including once to meet with the Polish Olympic Committee, which was striving to build a ballclub that would be competitive on the international baseball stage, and another time to attend the dedication of two Little League fields named in his honor and to pass out 250 gloves to all those young, aspiring Musials in cities like Wroclaw and Jaslo. Musial stayed with the Cards long after his playing days were over and was the team's general manager when it won the 1967 World Series.
In many ways, Musial more than served the Cardinals. He was the franchise. A formidable statue of Musial was erected in front of Busch Stadium, and the inscription had it right: "Baseball's perfect warrior, baseball's perfect knight."
He was, and will always be, Stan the Man.

When I was in college, I collected contemporary Topps baseball cards.
I was obsessive about it, too. I bought box after box, and tracked the cards I still needed with a checklist of my own design. And even after I'd bought so many boxes that I was missing only 20 or 30 cards in the 792-card set, I continued to buy more packs of cards on the off-chance that I'd actually get one that I didn't already have (hey, I told you I was obsessive). The end result of all this craziness each year was one complete set -- well, nearly complete -- and many, many "extra" cards that weren't worth the flimsy cardboard on which they were printed (but I never lacked for bubble gum!).
I admit this sheepishly, but I can happily report that I've found other obsessions in the years since. When I buy baseball cards now, it's still Topps, but it's only a pack at a time, just for nostalgia's sake when I'm in the card shop with my stepson (who, alas, is obsessed with Magic cards rather than baseball cards).
And this weekend when I got home from the shop with one pack of 2003 Topps (Series 1), I had an idea: I'd write something about each card in the pack, no matter how uninteresting it might be.
So here are all 10 cards, in the order in which I found them ...
#229 -- Melvin Mora



Whereon we learn,
Though it has been Melvin's defensive versatility -- and status as father of quintuplets -- that has garnered him the most attention, he has enough bat juice to produce periodic streaks of surprising production. On June 28-29, 2002, he became the first Oriole to lead off consecutive games with a HR since Brady Anderson did it in both ends of a doubleheader in 1999.
Indeed, Mora hit 19 home runs last season, and that was 11 more than he'd ever hit in a professional season, minors or majors. He also drew 70 walks, which makes for a nice power/patience combination, especially considering he plays center field and shortstop. And while Mora's batting average is a concern -- just .233 in 2002 -- the total package was enough to make him just about as valuable as ...
#88 -- Jose Cruz Jr.
In the old days, when I opened a pack of cards, I hoped to discover one worth more than a nickel (not that I ever actually sold anything). These days, when I open a pack of cards I hope to find something to write about. So you can imagine how my heart leapt for joy when the second card in this pack was everybody's favorite new Giants right fielder.
Last week, reader Joshua Packard sent me the following ...
Do you think he's a good player?
Do you think there is some value in knowing what a player will do? (i.e. does the fact that Jose Cruz Jr. has been essentially the same player for the last several years give him some value (call it predictability) that isn't accounted for with OPS?)

I've got a couple of answers: yes, and yes.
More?
Yeah, I think Cruz is a good player. No, he's not the superstar that everybody thought he would become way back when (i.e. 1997). But you know, his minor-league numbers never really suggested that he would become a great major leaguer. He was the third pick in the (1995) draft and he was a switch-hitter with a pretty swing, and for a lot of people that's plenty. But those monster numbers in the minors? They just weren't there. Which is why I never got all that excited about him.
And of course, he hasn't met those expectations. After the Giants signed Cruz, I got a few e-mail messages the basic gist of which was, "Why should we be excited about this guy?"
You should be excited because there weren't a lot of corner outfielders available, and the Giants probably got the best one that was left. What the Giants needed to do was replace the production they got from Reggie Sanders last season. In 140 games, Sanders hit 23 homers, scored 75 runs, knocked in 85, and batted .250/.324/.455 (BA/OBP/Slugging).
Ron Shandler's projection for Cruz includes a .338 OBP and a .485 slugging percentage, but that was before Cruz signed with the Giants, who play in the best pitcher's park in the National League. So his numbers won't be quite that good, but he should give the Giants essentially what Sanders gave them.
As for whether or not there's value in consistency, I think that there is ... but only if the organization is sophisticated enough to notice.
What do I mean by that? A sophisticated organization estimates how many games they want to win in the coming season, and then they figure out how many runs they need to score, and how many they can allow. Armed with those figures, you can start building your roster with at least a modicum of precision. And it stands to reason that the more you know about how an individual player will perform, the more precise you can be.
All that said, I don't know that Cruz is particularly consistent. Granted, his OPS's were essentially the same from 1998 through 2000, and his 2002 OPS was similar. But his playing time has been up and down over the years, due to both injuries and ineffectiveness. And his OPS in 2001 was out of context with the rest of his career. Still, it's probably true that with Cruz, you do know what you're going to get. And what the Giants got was a good player who should make them the favorites in the National League West this season.
#242 -- Robert Person
From the back of the card:
On June 2, 2002, Robert not only threw five shutout innings at the Expos, but supported his effort with a grand slam and a three-run homer. A .116 career hitter at the time, his 7 RBI were team pitcher's record.
Perhaps it goes without saying that the less said about Person's pitching, the better.
#227 -- Junior Spivey



From marginal prospect to National League All-Star in an eyeblink, Junior -- Ernest Lee by birth -- was a 36th-round pick in Arizona's first draft.
It's true that he was a 36th-round draft pick, and it's also true that he's probably one of the better 36th-round draft picks you'll ever meet. But I'm not sure I buy the notion that he was a "marginal prospect" just an "eyeblink" before becoming an All-Star. In Spivey's first season as a professional, he batted .335 and drew 35 walks in 51 games. In his third pro season (1998), he batted .290, drew 92 walks, and stole 42 bases in 113 games.
After that season, John Sickels wrote that Spivey "... is now regarded as a prospect, albeit a marginal one."
Oops. I guess that he was marginal, at least in 1998.
And do you know what's odd? 1998 was the best minor-league season Spivey had. He spent most of 1999 and 2000 on the disabled list with various injuries, and then he didn't play all that well in 2001 (most of which he spent with the D-Backs). So when you consider Spivey's history, you have to give the Diamondbacks a lot of credit for realizing there was a good player waiting to come out ... though I doubt if even they fantasized that he'd become an All-Star in his first season as a regular.
#OG6 -- Lance Berkman ("Own the Game" subset)
The back of the card lists the top 10 RBI men in the major leagues last year, and Berkman is fourth on the list -- and first in the National League -- with 128. What I found particularly interesting, though, are the next two NLers on the list, Albert Pujols (123) and Pat Burrell (116).
Pujols, because if there was ever a guy who didn't suffer the sophomore jinx, it's him. It's exceptionally rare for a Rookie of the Year to play just as well the next season, but that's exactly what Pujols did.
Burrell, because he's turned into a star and nobody really seems to have noticed. Maybe that's just life with the Phillies, though; Bobby Abreu certainly isn't as famous as he should be. I think all that's going to change in 2003, though. When the Phillies score 900 runs and dethrone the Braves, people will have to notice. Won't they?
#334 -- Athletics win 20 consecutive games!
If one flipped a coin 20 times, the odds of it coming up heads on each flip are 1-in-1,048,576. Thus, Oakland's 20-game winning streak from August 13 to September 4, 2002, was truly one in a million. The A's won games 18 and 19 on Miguel Tejada (homer and single) in the bottom of the ninth. Then, after blowing an 11-0 lead, Oakland won its 20th straight on a Scott Hatteberg homer -- again in the bottom of the ninth. The Athletics' final triumph broke the AL record for consecutive victories.
But it wasn't quite one in a million, was it? Because the A's were an excellent team last year -- remember, they won 103 games -- and their competition during that 20-game winning streak was something less than excellent. The A's beat the Royals (62-100) five times, the Tigers (55-106) three times, and the Indians (74-88) four times. They also beat the Blue Jays (78-84) twice, the White Sox (81-81) three times, and the Twins (94-67) three times. So that's 20 games and 20 wins, with only three against a team that finished 2002 with a winning record.
I don't want to figure the actual odds (and I don't want to encourage any of you), but I have to think it was something less than one in a million.
#143 -- Jose Vizcaino
He's been around so long that there's no room for any words under his statistics ... Which makes writing about him harder, because what can you write about Jose Vizcaino that hasn't already been written?
He'll be 35 next month. But on a brighter note, last season was the first since 1997 in which Vizcaino finished with more than 400 at-bats (406, to be precise). Also, last season he set a career best with a .397 slugging percentage, and if Vizcaino could be counted on for another season like 2002, the Astros might as well just dump Julio Lugo and give Vizcaino the full-time job.
But he can't, and so they shouldn't.
#15 -- Trot Nixon
You want consistent? Since reaching the majors for good, Nixon's slugging percentages look like this:
It should be said that those numbers are a bit misleading, because Nixon was rarely allowed to hit against left-handed pitchers in 1999 and 2000. So his consistency since then actually represents an improvement, as he's posted those slugging percentages while moving into more a full-time role (535 at-bats in 2001, 532 in 2002). We're still waiting for that big season, though, and Ron Shandler thinks it might come in 2003. With Nixon hitting more fly balls and fewer ground balls, with his big second half (16 homers, .519 slugging percentage), and with some other good stuff that I don't understand, Shandler says, "30 HR could be a no-brainer."
#84 -- Rafael Furcal



When is everybody going to get together on this guy's birthday?
According to Furcal's player card here at ESPN.com, he was born on October 4, 1977. According to The Scouting Notebook 2003 (now published by The Sporting News), Furcal was born on October 4, 1978.
And The Topps Company? Just like the Atlanta Braves, Topps continues to maintain that Furcal was born in 1980. It's funny, how the Braves continue to foist this fiction upon the suspecting public. Maybe they think that if they just keep repeating 1980 over and over again, it will somehow come true. And their shortstop will somehow return to having many growth years ahead of him.
#43 -- Javier Lopez
He's no Jose Cruz, but finding Lopez in my pack allows me to correct an error that I made the last time I wrote about the Braves catcher. In either a column or a chat or maybe both, I excoriated GM John Schuerholz for exercising a $7 million option for 2003 on Javier Lopez's contract.
I was wrong about that. It wasn't a team option, it was a player option, and of course Lopez and his agent didn't have to be the saltiest crackers in the world to exercise that one.
Instead, I should have excoriated Schuerholz for giving Lopez that option in the first place.

I have seen the future of the knuckleball, and his name is Zink. Charlie Zink.
This weekend, I was in Phoenix for Ron Shandler's First Pitch Arizona
Most prospect hounds would be excited about Brazelton, and he was impressive, showing off a solid fastball, a good slider, and a killer changeup while striking out nine Dogs in five innings. But it was Charlie Zink I wanted to see, because Zink, a Red Sox farmhand, is easily the best young knuckleball pitcher in the world. He didn't disappoint, either, allowing just one hit and one walk in five innings.
Zink hadn't fared well in the AFL before Saturday, in part (I suspect) because the knuckleball doesn't dance its normal dance at the Valley's somewhat lofty altitude. But I don't think the Red Sox will hold it against him. 2003 was just Zink's second minor-league season, and here's how he's done so far:
Age   Level    IP   H   HR  BB  SO   ERA
 22     A      57   44   1  19  59  1.42
 23 A/AA/AFL  201  170  16  91 128  3.94
Now, let's look at Tim Wakefield's first three seasons as a knuckleballer:
Age   Level    IP   H   HR  BB  SO   ERA
 22     A-     40   30   1  21  42  3.40
 23     A     190  187  24  85 127  4.73
 24    AA     183  155  13  51 120  2.90
Wakefield and Zink were both born in August, which makes comparing them particularly appropriate. And Zink is clearly ahead of Wakefield at the same age. Zink was better at 22, he was better at 23, and at both ages he was pitching against tougher competition. Does this mean that Zink's going to follow Wakefield's career path? Of course not. Wakefield broke through at 24, in Double-A, and there's no guarantee that Zink will.
But Zink will open next season in Double-A, and he'll be 24. As near as I can tell, here's a list of the last three pitchers who had good knuckleballs when they were 24 years old, along with how many games they won in the major leagues:
Wakefield, 116 (so far)
Charlie Hough, 216
Phil Niekro, 318
(Actually, when Niekro was 24 he was in U.S. Army. But he was a pretty good minor-league knuckleballer at 23 and 25.)
The point here is that not many pitchers can throw a knuckleball for strikes while in their early 20s, and the ones who can generally enjoy long major-league careers.
But nobody seems to realize how good Charlie Zink might be. Scouts and writers see Charlie Zink and they think, "Oh, isn't that cute. He throws a knuckleball. If everything works out for him, he's got a chance to be a decent pitcher someday."
One writer, evaluating the Mesa Desert Dogs, listed Zink as a "Sleeper Pitcher" and concluded, "Future #5 Starter/Reliever."
Another writer admitted that "Zink is a very interesting pitcher," and recommended, "Keep an eye on him."
Wrong, guys. I'm going to keep both eyes on him, because he's going to be a good major-league pitcher, a better major-league pitcher than the great majority of the pitchers in the Arizona Fall League who are considered better prospects.
Among all the pitchers in the Arizona Fall League, Zink has the best chance, by far, of enjoying a healthy career, and (to a lesser extent) he also has the best chance of enjoying a long and productive career. Baseball today isn't particularly friendly to knuckleball pitchers -- it's too easy for a mistake to become a home run -- so I don't think it's all that likely that Zink will become a star. If you're looking for a star in the Arizona Fall League, your better bets are Dewon Brazelton, Neal Cotts, or Boof Bonser.
But those guys all have the talent to be No. 1 starters in the major leagues, and Charlie Zink is not that far behind them. I think Zink is likely to have a career something like Tim Wakefield's. And he might be Phil Niekro.

The Office of the Commissioner has now existed for nearly 85 years, and yet there have been only nine of them. Here's an overview, focusing on their impact on the game ...
Kenesaw Mountain Landis (1920-1944)
Described by one writer as "flinty, colorful, and often arbitrary," Landis was baseball's first commissioner and still, by almost any measure, its greatest.
In 1891, when still a young man, Landis earned a law degree from Chicago's Union Law School. Before long, thanks largely to political connections -- two of Landis' brothers were Indiana congressmen -- he won an appointment as a federal judge, and quickly became known for his "quirky and newsworthy justice" (granted, many of his better-known decisions were overturned by higher courts). In 1914, the Federal League challenged the National and American Leagues on the field, and also in the courts, arguing that the "reserve clause" -- which essentially bound National and American League players to their employers forever -- was illegal. Landis heard the case ... and did nothing while the Federal League eventually went under.
This made Landis some big friends in high baseball places. And in 1920, when the Lords of Baseball were desperate to restore public confidence in the sport in the wake of the Black Sox scandal, they turned to Landis to lead a new three-member "Board of Control." Landis demanded "absolute power," and he got something very close to that.
Among Landis' first acts was his most famous; in the summer of 1921, though none of the Black Sox were convicted of any crime, Landis suspended them forever, saying, "Regardless of the outcome of juries, no player that throws a ball game, no player that entertains proposals or promises to throw a game, no player that sits in a conference with a bunch of crooked players where the ways and means of throwing games are discussed, and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever again play professional baseball."
With that single decision, Landis might have done more for the sport than anyone else, ever. Certainly, Landis never did anything more important. He did, in the 1930s, "free" a number of minor leaguers in his efforts to prevent major-league teams from establishing their own farm systems. It was a noble effort in a good cause, but it was also doomed to fail.
Landis has been blamed for delaying the integration of the major leagues, but the truth is that the owners didn't want black players in the majors any more than Landis did. And it's not likely that, even if Landis hadn't died in 1944, he could have prevented Branch Rickey from bringing Jackie Robinson to the National League in 1947.
Happy Chandler (1945-1951)
Chandler, a governor of Kentucky and then a U.S. senator, impressed the Lords during World War II with his public pronouncements about the relationship between baseball and American society. With Landis' death in 1944, the owners needed a new commissioner, and Chandler happily accepted the job (and resigned his Senate seat).
In 1947, Chandler suspended Dodgers manager Leo Durocher because of his alleged ties to various shady characters. That same spring, Chandler had to deal with the controversy surrounding Jackie Robinson's promotion to the Dodgers, which was opposed by nearly every owner and by a number of ballplayers. Chandler later took some credit for smoothing the way, but aside from his account there's little evidence for that. As Jules Tygiel wrote in Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy, "At best, one can describe Chandler's role as endorsement by abstinence. Chandler's own claims to posterity notwithstanding, he appears as no more than a bit player in these historic events."
Perhaps the smartest thing Chandler ever said was this, in 1951: "The owners don't want a real commissioner." That same year, he resigned after his bosses refused to give him a contract extension, and later served again as governor of Kentucky.
Ford Frick (1951-1965)
Once a sportswriter, Frick took over as president of the National League in 1935 (when that position really meant something), and held the job until taking over as commissioner in 1951. In 1947, while Chandler was sitting on his hands, Frick supposedly told the Cardinals players who threatened a strike if Jackie Robinson were allowed to play, "If you strike, you're through. I don't care if it wrecks the league for 10 years." The rebellious Redbirds backed down.
In fairness, it should be noted that Frick, as commissioner, never had a chance like that again. But he also avoided making decisions whenever possible. To this day, when old-timers talk about Frick's tenure they can't help but remember his standard reaction to various disputes: "That is a league matter."
So Frick didn't do much, the notable exception being in 1961, when Roger Maris threatened Babe Ruth's single-season record for home runs. Frick had once served as Ruth's favorite ghostwriter, so this time he did something, famously calling for an "asterisk" to be placed next to Maris' name in the record books, because Maris achieved his feat in a 162-game season, as opposed to Ruth's 154-game season. Not as famously, the asterisk never actually appeared (instead, both records were listed, with notations about the season lengths).
Gen. William D. Eckert (1965-1969)
"Spike" Eckert, a retired army general, made only one significant ruling, but it's one that significantly changed the course of at least one franchise's history.
In February 1966, the Atlanta Braves signed USC pitcher Tom Seaver to a contract for close to $50,000. However, Eckert voided the contract because USC's baseball season had already started, making Seaver ineligible to sign a professional contract. Meanwhile, the NCAA ruled Seaver ineligible to play for USC because he'd signed a professional contract (valid or not).
Of course, this made Seaver a man without a team, so Eckert made another ruling: any team willing to match Atlanta's offer would have an equal shot at Seaver. Three teams -- the Phillies, Indians, and Mets -- entered the derby. And on April 3, Eckert reached into a hat and plucked out a piece of paper that read NEW YORK METS. Seaver pitched a six-hitter in his first minor-league game, won a spot on the major league roster the next spring, and of course the rest is history.
This was shortly into Eckert's term as commissioner, and after the Seaver case had been resolved The Sporting News editorialized,
We think you'll be seeing Eckert take positive action in other matters as he gets the feel of his job.
Writers who greeted his appointment with wisecracks about "the unknown soldier" are changing their tune. They've seen him in the Florida camps, and they are revising their estimates of the man who became a three-star general at the age of 51.
Eckert has yet to hit a home run as commissioner, but he has not struck out, either.
This was probably the nicest thing anybody every wrote about Eckert's tenure. Late in 1968, with labor problems on the horizon, the owners asked Eckert to resign. In the three years since the Seaver case, Eckert had not done -- or not been allowed to do anything -- that's still remembered. With each passing year "the unknown soldier" becomes more unknown.
Bowie Kuhn (1969-1984)
Just as Ford Frick became identified with a phrase that justified passivity, Kuhn became identified with a phrase that justified activity: "in the best interests of the game." Using that rationale, Kuhn banned Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays (!) because they worked as greeters at casinos (?), and he voided mid-1970s deals that sent various Oakland superstars to rich teams in exchange for huge (for the time) sums of money.
Kuhn wasn't particularly a friend of the players, and is often remembered now as simply a tool of the owners. It's true, the owners did pay his salary. But Kuhn frequently clashed with A's owner Charlie Finley, and he suspended both George Steinbrenner (who pled guilty to illegal campaign contributions) and Ted Turner (who tampered with potential free agent Gary Matthews).
Baseball's first two strikes came during Kuhn's tenure, in 1972 and 1981, and he might fairly be criticized for failing to effectively guide the owners in their dealings with Players Association head Marvin Miller. Kuhn is also remembered for allowing postseason games to be played at night, and he stubbornly refused to wear a coat when attending those games, no matter how frigid the temperature. In the end, nobody really liked Kuhn ... which might mean he was doing his job about as well as a commissioner of his era could.
Peter Ueberroth (1984-1989)
Ueberroth was a money man, so it's appropriate, when discussing his tenure as commissioner, to list two figures: $280 million, and $1.5 billion.
In the winters following the 1986 and '87 seasons, there were surprisingly few offers made to free-agent players. Eventually the surprise was explained: with the encouragement of Ueberroth, the owners simply agreed that they wouldn't sign free agents. This was clearly a violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that governed the relationship between the owners and the players, and eventually the owners were forced to pay $280 million to the players who had been free agents during the off-seasons in question (and if the owners ever get caught doing the same thing, they'll have to pay triple damages).
On a happier note, no commissioner before Ueberroth, in any sport, had been quite so accomplished at shaking the money tree (and playing the PR game; Ueberroth lifted Kuhn's suspensions of Mantle and Mays). Under Ueberroth, Major League Baseball greatly increased the number of corporate sponsorships, and licensing monies also grew beyond any owner's happiest imagination. Most significantly, Ueberroth brokered a pair of gigantic four-year TV contracts, one with CBS and the other with ESPN, which together added nearly $1.5 billion to the owners' coffers.
Bart Giamatti (1989)
Giamatti's tenure as commissioner lasted exactly 154 days, but if you ask a typical baseball fan to name three commissioners, there's a pretty good chance Giamatti will take one of those three spots.
Why? Pete Rose.
Before Giamatti replaced Ueberroth as commissioner, he served for a few years as president of the National League. In 1988, Reds manager Pete Rose got into a shoving match with umpire Dave Pallone, and Giamatti suspended Rose for 30 days. It was the longest suspension of a manager since Chandler suspended Durocher. Later, unfortunately, Rose came into Giamatti's life again.
Ueberroth, when still commissioner, had learned that Rose was associating with bookies and might have bet large sums of money on baseball games. It was Ueberroth who hired attorney John Dowd to investigate Rose, but Giamatti -- as National League president and Ueberroth's anointed successor -- was involved in every step of the process. On May 9, 1989, Dowd submitted his report to Giamatti, who by then had replaced Ueberroth.
Dowd's report seemed conclusive: Rose definitely hung out with some unsavory characters, he certainly bet on baseball games (grounds for a one-year suspension), and he quite probably bet on Reds games (grounds for permanent suspension, as Rose was, at the time, managing the Reds).
Due to various gaffes by nearly all parties involved, Giamatti couldn't explicitly suspend Rose for gambling. In the end, Rose signed an agreement that stipulated his permanent suspension from Organized Baseball, but did include the clause, "Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed either an admission or a denial by Peter Edward Rose ..."
Nevertheless, Giamatti, answering a question from the media, said, "... I have concluded that (Rose) bet on baseball."
On the Reds?
"Yes."
Exactly one week after announcing the Rose decision, Giamatti suffered a massive heart attack and died.
Fay Vincent (1989-1992)
Upon taking over as commissioner, Giamatti had created the post of Deputy Commissioner for his best friend, Vincent. With Giamatti's unexpected death, Vincent was immediately named commissioner.
Vincent, though his impact on the sport was not particularly significant, will likely be remembered as the last commissioner who wasn't completely in the pockets of the owners. For that alone, we should remember him fondly.
Bud Selig (1992-????)
With the possible exception of Landis, no other commissioner has made a larger mark on the game than Selig, and nobody has been more of an activist. Under Selig's watch, Major League Baseball has:
added two franchises;
played regular-season games in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Japan;
scheduled, for the first time, regular-season games between teams from different leagues;
expanded the number of divisions in each league, from two to three; and
added the "Wild Card" to the postseason mix, which also now includes three rounds (including two best-of-five Division Series in each league).
And if Selig had his way, there would have been more changes under his watch. He also favored (or was said to favor; you can never be sure) an international draft, "radical realignment" (in which as many as 14 teams would have switched leagues), and the "contraction" of two teams prior to the 2002 season. For various reasons, none of these things got past the talking stage, but you have to give Selig credit: for all his obvious flaws, he's not afraid of change.
But Selig's legacy goes beyond the changes he's advocated. Selig has truly redefined the job. Whereas the commissioner once served, at least occasionally, as an intermediary between the players and the owners, a settler of disputes, today the commissioner's jobs are essentially to serve as MLB's public face and to find common ground on which most of the owners can stand. It's been said that getting the Lords of Baseball to agree on something is like herding cats. Once, that job was generally performed by one of the stronger owners (Walter O'Malley, for instance). But these days, with so many owners selling their teams after a few years -- thanks to a tax loophole -- herding the cats is the commissioner's job. And baseball's never seen another cat-herder like Bud Selig.

From the very first sentence -- "The canvas sack hung limp from its standard like the body of a Cornwellian highwayman from his roadside gibbet." -- we know that Willie's Time: Baseball's Golden Age, Charles Einstein's masterpiece, is no ordinary baseball book.
But then, Willie's Time is a "baseball book" only in the crudest sense of the term. The only biography of a baseball player to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, Willie's Time tells the story of Willie Mays' career against the backdrop of five Presidential administrations, Truman through Nixon, while elegantly weaving in strands of American history, politics, and sociology.
Charles Einstein, a member of the Baseball Writers Association of America for more than half a century, collaborated with Mays on two autobiographies -- Born to Play Ball (1955) and My Life In and Out of Baseball (1966) -- and edited the four Fireside Books of Baseball, all of them essential parts of any baseball library.
Willie's Time, first released in 1979, has just been republished by Southern Illinois University Press, and I recently conducted the following e-mail interview with Einstein.
**********
Neyer: Charlie, I first read Willie's Time about 15 years ago, and ever since then I've remembered the book as nothing short of brilliant. But it wasn't until re-reading it last week that I remembered why it's brilliant. Before I dive into what you actually wrote, I'd like to ask a bit about the process ... The book is so intricately constructed, and filled with so many details, that I have to think that you spent 1) many years thinking about it, and 2) more years writing it. You care to confirm or deny that?
Einstein: I had ghosted Willie's autobiography, My Life In and Out of Baseball, in 1966, with three more chapters added in 1973 when he was traded to the Mets. The last thing I then had in mind was competing with myself with another book. But I had the concept of the Mays career spanning five Presidents, which became the five-chapter construct of Willie's Time, and I had the title, which I loved. That title was all things -- brief, memorable, descriptive -- but most of all it was reader-friendly. Then or now, you can't say "Willie's Time" and go away mad.
If you stop and think about it, knowing in advance both the title and chapter breakdown pretty much gets you nearly there all by itself. At least it did for me. Willie's Time could do what his previous autobiographies couldn't do -- praise Willie, not just in my words but others'. And publication could be timed to his entry into the Hall of Fame.
Anyway, I did a very brief (maybe six pages) outline. Most of the outline, as I recall, was a recitation of trivia, like the time my sports editor phoned me from a bar with his column for the next day and wound up dictating it to Prof. Albert Einstein. Three publishers said no. A fourth, Lippincott, took it.  I started to write it around early 1978 and completed it with an added segment on his January '79 election to the Hall of Fame.
Numbers of people have asked me how I knew just the right baseball or non-baseball anecdote at just the right moment.  They're fascinated that the tale begins with a Santa Fe train and ends with the same train more than 25 years later. But the fact is, it was a convenient way for me to begin the narrative and a total accident to end it with the same train still in operation -- something I hadn't discovered till I was actually winding up the story months later.
So I just don't know. I do know I've tried similar book ideas with other publishers since, only to discover I can go three years researching, and then simply can't write it at all.
Neyer: When you think about the book now, 25 years later, what comes to mind first? Satisfaction with having written a book that was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize? Or frustration that you haven't written something similar since?
Einstein: The Pulitzer is a fine prize if you win. I remember sending off the manuscript to the publisher with an accompanying note that said, "Here it is. You've got a good book." And the critical reception was one rave after another, which of course I just soaked up. The American Airlines in-flight magazine was the first one that came in, and it was just a beaut. The reviewer, William Bandler, said the book was written "with affection, a keen sensitivity, and a touch of rambunctiousness." And he ended it on a prophetic note: "Technically," he wrote, "Willie's time has passed; in truth, it will be with us for years." And here are you and I talking, 25 years later.
Do I feel frustration that I haven't topped it? In one sense, No. The final chapter in the book is titled "His Mama Didn't Have But One," and I suppose in a way that could apply to me as a sire of books as well as to Willie as a ballplayer. So no lasting frustration. Depression, though, is something else. Was I genuinely depressed that I only had but one? You bet.
Neyer: I have more questions about the book and Willie Mays, but right now I'd like to go back a few years and ask you what it was like to grow up 1) in New York during the 1940s, with all that great baseball, and 2) as the son of a very famous man. Can I assume that you didn't have any problem getting good seats at the Polo Grounds? And were the Giants your favorite team? (For the sake of the readers, I should mention that your father was Harry Einstein, whose stage name was Parkyakarkus and was one of America's most famous comedians.)
Einstein: I was 15 in the summer of 1941, which might have been the greatest baseball season of all time. Bob Creamer did a whole book, a marvelous book, just on that season alone. The Yankees won in the American League, with (Joe) DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. (Ted) Williams hit .406 for the BoSox. The Dodgers beat out the Cardinals in a wonderful NL race. And Creamer points out that we were at war only for the last three weeks of the year, two months after the World Series, but thanks to defense spending and military build-up, the Depression was over. It was a great time to be a 15-year-old in a New York summer.
My father was living in California at that time -- I grew up in Manhattan with my mother and stepfather (he died last year at the age of 99) -- but I had been going to the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium by myself ever since I was 10 or 11, and not only those. Once I saw a game from the condemned roof of a garage across Bedford Avenue from right field at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. The NYC price scale was 55 cents for the bleachers, $1.10 for "general admissions," $1.65 for reserved-seat grandstand, and $2.20 for box seats. For World Series, the scale was doubled. Can you imagine a $5 bill buying you a box seat for the World Series today, with enough left over for round-trip subway fare, four hot dogs and a Coke?
Ballplayers in those days didn't have the money to spend the offseason lifting weights and sniffing substances. I was 11 years old and left-handed. My mother and I made a Christmas visit to Boston, where her sister worked in the advertising department at the Gilchrist department store. Elbie Fletcher, a left-handed first baseman with the Boston Bees (as the Braves were known for a few seasons) was selling ties in the men's dept., and my aunt arranged a lunch at the Parker House for us. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Opening Day, the Bees were at the Polo Grounds, so I skipped school to be there and caught up with Fletcher on the field after the final out. He pretended he remembered me. I invited him for dinner that night. "Sorry," he said. "I've got to be with my cousin." I said, "What about tomorrow night?" He said, "I've got another cousin." Some histories say he was the best-fielding first baseman of all time. I agree. I'd been a Giant fan, but needless to say I became a Boston fan, and then when Fletcher was traded to Pittsburgh, a Pirate fan. But I think I was at least 12 before I realized the Giants were not a privileged class just because they wore white and everybody else wore gray.
Neyer: Funny that you'd mention Creamer's Summer of '41, because when I read it, my reaction was, "Wow, somebody finally figured out a way to do, sort of, what Einstein did in Willie's Time." There are a lot of things to love about your book, but I think one of the things that sets it apart is the agility with which you place Willie Mays in his time. I've read -- or at least started -- any number of baseball books that try to do something similar, but nearly all of them do it so heavy-handedly that there doesn't seem to be any real connection between the baseball and everything else that's happening in the world. But you weave in a great deal of American history (and non-Mays baseball history, too), and somehow it works.
I guess that's not really a question, but a long comment. Here's a question, then ... I'm curious about your take on baseball's latest scandal, and I wonder if we'll ever see another player like Willie Mays, who stood 5-feet-10, weighed 170-180 pounds, and hit 660 home runs. Reading about him, we're led to the conclusion that he was immensely strong, his relatively small stature notwithstanding. Why are all (or most) of today's power hitters behemoths?
Einstein: Mays had the strongest back of any player I know of. His back? Yup. The sculptor who did the statue of him outside Pac Bell had to deal with that combination of large power and small size, 'cause he wasn't then (and isn't now) a large man. But I did a magazine piece once on Bill Lear, the inventor of the Lear Jet and the 8-track stereo and Lord knows what else, and asked him if a single short sentence could be used to describe his work. He said, "Make it smaller." And I often thought of Willie in those terms.
Obviously, people want to see home runs. If it takes steroids or pills to increase their size, the hitters will still swing and miss just as often -- maybe more so, since the pitchers are bigger too -- but the fly ball will go farther. (And if it doesn't go far enough, they can always look for outside help. Like some six or seven years ago, when somebody -- was it Jose Canseco? -- was playing center field and a fly ball hit him on the head and bounced over the fence for a home run. In Willie's time -- my time too, when I would rotate into the role of official scorer -- that mother would have been scored as a four-base error. I mean, a home run that came down on top of the fielder's head? Come on.)
Trouble now is that baseball is a wondrous adventure in comparisons, one player, one team, against some other player, some other team. Yet, In the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, half the Germans were dressed in GI uniforms. So you'd challenge them: "Who's third base for the St. Louis Browns?" And if they didn't say Mark Christman, they were dead meat. Today, it'd be Mark WHO? How many folks can use the latest third baseman as proof positive of identity today?
Neyer: Have you been to Pac Bell? And if so, what do you think of it? I've got a great deal of nostalgia for the old ballparks, from Wrigley and Fenway (which of course I've seen) to the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field (which I haven't). But walking around Pac Bell and looking down at the Giants' cream-colored uniforms in the midst of all that green grass, and surrounded by the bricks of the ballpark and the Bay beyond the right-field wall ... well, I don't know that it gets a lot better than that.
Einstein: No, I haven't been inside Pac Bell, but my son drove me around it when I was visiting there in February '03, and it is a true classic. How can you tell? Well, for one thing it's a ballpark that draws quite heavily on public transportation. Only one of the National League parks Mays played in, in his rookie year of 1951, was still in use when he ended his career in 1973. That was Wrigley Field, which was also the last place to do the national anthem before the games. My personal favorite was the run-down crackerbox at Central and Mohave where the Giants trained and their Phoenix farm club played, but that ended more than 40 years ago. But we are in a new era of stadium building, from the Sandcastle at Atlantic City to Les Murakami Stadium on the Honolulu campus of the University of Hawaii.
And last year minor-league attendance was the highest in 55 years (and its second highest ever). As Manny Trillo said, the best thing about the game is that you can always do something about yesterday tomorrow.
Neyer: Just a few more ... Actually, here's a two-part question. Among the many things I learned in the book is that Willie Mays apparently had a significant impact on attendance in the Giants' road games, throughout his career. Do you think we'll ever see another player with that sort of impact? Also, to what extent do you follow the game today?
Einstein: Will we ever see Willie's likes again? His likes, maybe. People are always saying "X looked like Mays on that play" or "Y may be the next Willie Mays." But he's been retired over 30 years by now, and interestingly it's only catches in the outfield that trigger comparison. In running, throwing, hitting for distance, hitting for average, people just concede his greatness. But for Willie alone people would drive 100, 150 miles to a ball park just to watch him field his position.
A teammate of his on the old Birmingham Black Barons summed it up: "His mama didn't have but one."
But yes, I remain a fan of this game and had the joy in my lifetime of seeing Ozzie Smith play shortstop and Elbie Fletcher play first base and a man named Mays in center field. That means I've already died and gone to heaven.
I also used to have a fantasy team in a league whose games were played with a pair of dice on a card table. John Thorn and Pete Palmer confirmed statistically that home teams win 54 percent of the time, and we can wonder what element contributes most to that unbalanced result. Some say home field, some say home fans, some say home cooking.
President Bush, a former baseball exec, says none of the above. "Look," he says, "once you've played eight innings, the game tilts. From that point on one team has to protect a lead and the other team doesn't. It's as simple as that."
Bud Selig will tell you I've been after him since 1997 to modify the rule book so any time a postponed game has to be re-scheduled in the other team's park (or any other park), the originally-scheduled home team will still get to bat last. I have a small mountain of correspondence in which he totally agrees. But weightier matters keep intruding, and I don't think they've made the change yet. Maybe they never will. When you have a game where the scoring is done by the team that doesn't have the ball, almost anything can happen. And quite regularly does.
Neyer: Again, after reading the book I could ask you a hundred other questions, but it's getting late so instead let me just say thanks for doing this, and here's one last question ... I know the new version of "Willie's Time" has an updated section up front, but there still had to be some other underlying reason for publishing it again, yes?
Einstein: Well, in 1979 there was only one audience for a book about Willie: the generation that got to see him play, at least on TV, in the "golden age," and of life in general in the '50s and '60s. Now a second generation has come along, one that never saw him play at all. So you've doubled your audience -- the generation of nostalgia plus the generation of discovery -- and one can turn out to be just as exciting as the other. The passage of time? Baseball's the game with no clock ...

The failure to tame the slider has doomed the careers of hundreds and thousands of pitchers, who got lost in their long journey to control and command the subtle pitch. Their hands might have been too small, or they could never quite get the arm angle right, or they just couldn't put enough torque into the spin.
Then there is Chad Gaudin, a 21-year-old right-hander for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Slider Master.
Gaudin was in Little League when a coach named Johnny Reynolds showed him the grip for the curveball. OK. Got it.
Then when Gaudin was in high school, his summer league coach, Chris Westcott, suggested he lower his arm angle when he threw with the curveball grip, to make the ball break laterally. Sure, no problem; yeah, looks good.
And now, a few years later, the right-hander is in the majors, using the same curveball grip he learned in Little League, throwing from a higher arm angle, unleashing a nasty slider that veers like a Wiffleball and getting out hitters with All-Star résumé. "It's real comfortable for me," he said the other day. "If I had to work on any pitch, that would be the last pitch that I would have to make an adjustment with."
If the bases were loaded and he had to throw a strike, Gaudin said, he would be more at ease throwing his slider than a fastball. It just feels right.
It's apparent from the way Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella has used him that Piniella feels right about Gaudin. This season, Piniella has summoned him into the game three times to face right-handed hitters with runners on base: Alex Rodriguez twice, and Miguel Tejada.
A-Rod flied out in his first at-bat against Gaudin, on March 31, stranding two runners. On April 6, Gaudin entered the game with Kenny Lofton on first, and Rodriguez popped out. After left-handed hitting Jason Giambi singled, Gary Sheffield grounded out.
The next day, more of the same: Derek Jeter singled to open an inning against Gaudin, but Rodriguez bounced into a double play. Giambi doubled, before Sheffield grounded out. On April 11, Gaudin enticed Tejada to bounce into a fielder's choice, stranding two runners.
Gaudin has inherited five runners, and none have scored. He's pitched five innings, and has allowed no runs. Right-handed batters are 1-for-10 against him. "He could have a very long career if he maintains that slider," said an American League scout who saw Gaudin in spring training. "He's going to get a lot of right-handed hitters (out) with that thing."
Maintaining the slider has never been an issue for him. After Westcott suggested he drop down, Gaudin tinkered and practiced and learned to throw the pitch for strikes. The slider that he threw at Crescent City Baptist High School, in Harahan, La., actually had more break than his current version, Gaudin says; he would throw it at right-handed hitters, or even slightly behind them, and it would break on a flat, horizontal plane -- and the high school batters were helpless, of course.
Gaudin, raised in Louisiana, was drafted in the 34th round by the Devil Rays, the 1,009th player overall, lasting that long because of his modest size: He is listed at 5-foot-11, 165 pounds, in a sport where scouts prefer extra-large pitchers. He signed with the Devil Rays and was asked to raise his arm angle, to keep his slider from being too flat, to give it a sharper break. After a week or two of working with the new trajectory, Gaudin recalled, he felt comfortable with the slider again.
He was playing in an instructional league game against the Blue Jays and aimed his slider at a right-handed batter. As the ball neared home plate, the hitter dropped to the ground, to avoid being hit -- and the slider broke over the plate for a strike. Gaudin turned away from the plate to stifle his laughter, something that is considered bad form -- but all of the infielders and outfielders behind him were laughing.
Gaudin spun another slider at the batter, who dropped again -- only to see the ball break for another strike.
Gaudin was pitching in Class A last July, moved up to Double-A and threw a seven-inning no-hitter for Orlando. After being called up to the big leagues at the end of the year, he made three starts and 12 relief appearances for Tampa Bay, going 2-0 with a 3.60 ERA.
Nobody has outlined Gaudin's role to him, not that he needs any explanation. "I'll do whatever it takes," he said. "Middle relief, set-up, starter, whatever it may be."
There will always be a place for a Slider Master.

How do you remember Andre Dawson?
The answer is easy for Dusty Baker.
"Nobody played on sheer guts and bad knees longer than Hawk," said Baker, the Chicago Cubs manager. "He could have had a lot bigger numbers. He was a big-time player."
Is Dawson a Hall of Famer? Not yet, but he should be.
If Kirby Puckett is in the Hall, if Tony Perez is in the Hall, if Gary Carter, Ryne Sandberg and Ozzie Smith are in the Hall, Dawson needs to be there, too. He's every bit the player any of the other five are -- although, yes, we're comparing apples to oranges in some cases -- but is undervalued because he hit the Hall of Fame ballot in 2002, the year after Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs and Bret Boone drove in 141 runs.
It's time many voters take a second look and give Dawson the love he always gave fans, teammates and the clubs that paid him, even once giving the Chicago Cubs a blank check in exchange for his services.
Few remember Dawson when he came up with the Montreal Expos, as an oversized center fielder with Rookie of the Year skills. More, but still not many, remember him when he was at the peak of his skills in Montreal, a triple threat at the plate, on the bases and in right field.
Some will remember him only at the end of his career, when he limped through two hard-to-watch seasons with the Boston Red Sox and two more with the Florida Marlins. For most of us, however, the most vivid memories of Dawson came during his run with the Chicago Cubs.
With the Cubs, Dawson won a Most Valuable Player award in 1987 and helped his team to the National League East title in 1989, putting an end to the New York Mets' dominance. Even then, we weren't getting the best of Dawson.
We saw him struggle against the San Francisco Giants in the championship series. Only his teammates and peers understood the daily battle he went through to get onto the field with knees that only an orthopedic surgeon could love. He had been born with good ones, of course, and still had them when he left Florida A&M in 1976. He destroyed them playing with reckless abandon on the concrete-like artificial turf at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
Maybe this wasn't as tragic as the irreversible glaucoma that ended Puckett's career in 1995, after 12 seasons. But there's reason to give Dawson the benefit of the doubt in terms of his Hall of Fame candidacy.
No eligible player has ever collected as many hits (2,774) or RBI (1,591) without becoming a Hall of Famer -- a claim that Dawson will almost certainly pass to Harold Baines (2,866 hits, 1,628 RBI) when he goes onto the ballot a year from now.
Despite receiving mail in trainer's rooms and whirlpools, Dawson hated -- and that's not a strong enough word, really -- being out of the lineup. He pushed himself onto the field to establish marks that come with durability.
Dawson, who was such a good athlete that Davey Johnson started him in center field and Eric Davis in left in the 1987 All-Star Game, was the first player to ever put together 12 consecutive seasons in which he finished with double-figure home run and stolen base totals. He piled up 45 extra-base hits in 15 consecutive seasons, becoming the sixth name on a list that included only Henry Aaron, Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Mel Ott and Honus Wagner.
On the picture-perfect day he was enshrined into the Hall last summer, Sandberg took time to campaign for Dawson, whose free-agent signing in 1987 energized a Cubs franchise that had grown dormant since an unexpected trip to the National League Championship Series in 1984.


"No player in baseball history worked harder, suffered more or did it better than Andre Dawson," Sandberg said. "He's the best I've ever seen. I watched him win an MVP for a last-place team, and it was the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in baseball. He did it the right way, the natural way, and he did it in the field and on the bases and in every way, and I hope he will stand up here some day."
Sandberg's comment about "the natural way,'' was, of course, a shot at the Jose Canseco generation of illegally-enhanced, often one-dimensional sluggers. The numbers  Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Bonds and others put up from 1997 through 2003 diminished -- at least in reflection during that time -- the career statistics of hitters from the 1980s and early '90s, including Dawson and Jim Rice.
How much of a bump those guys get in voting remains to be seen.
Dawson gained 56 votes from 2002, his first year on the ballot, to '05, his fourth year. But because the electorate also grew in that span, that wasn't as big a gain as it might seem -- only from 45.3 percent to 52.3 percent. It meant he moved from 140 votes to 117 votes short of the 75-percent requirement for election.
That's a whole lot of minds to change. But if Canseco's book and the Richard Nixon moment experienced by Rafael Palmeiro aren't enough to get you thinking, well, maybe your reasoning, like Dawson's knees, is beyond repair.

Many possible pitfalls lie ahead for the White Sox, but one thing that shouldn't get in the way of a return to the playoffs is complacency.
Since the last five games of the regular season in 2005, they are 41-14, including the 11-1 run through the playoffs. After Tuesday's loss to the Devil Rays, the White Sox shared the majors'  best record (25-13) with the Tigers.  It's not, however, the best record in organized baseball.
Here's the kicker: That mark (30-8) belongs to the Charlotte Knights. They happen to be the Triple-A affiliate of the White Sox.
You want to talk about hot? Since a 6-5 start, the Knights have gone 24-3, reeling off winning streaks of 12 and six games, twice.
This run began on April 17. The parent White Sox have gone 18-8 in the same time frame, giving the organization's top two teams a combined 42-11 record over the last month. That's .792 baseball, or the equivalent of 128 wins over a 162-game season.
Given that Charlotte's roster is full of prospects ages 25 and under who in just about any other year would be pushing for jobs in Chicago, these numbers speak to the White Sox's chance to be a factor in the American League for the foreseeable future. That's the way general manager Ken Williams planned it.
"It wasn't just our goal to win the World Series," Williams said. "It was our goal to put together a team that could be in the playoffs on a regular basis. I've always worked with two- and three-year plans, not just considering the season we're in. That allows me to make moves when I have to. I've made some mistakes and I'm going to make some more, but things have fallen together nicely over the last couple of years."
Manager Razor Shines and many of Charlotte's players were on a Birmingham team that finished 25 games above .500 last season. That list includes third baseman Josh Fields, shortstop Pedro Lopez, first baseman Casey Rogowski, catcher Chris Stewart, outfielders Jerry Owens and Ryan Sweeney and pitchers Sean Tracey, Charlie Haeger, Heath Phillips and Paulino Reynoso.
This year's Birmingham team isn't as strong in the field but has some intriguing pitching prospects in right-hander Lance Broadway, a 2005 first-round pick from TCU, and left-handers Ray Liotta and Tyler Lumsden.
Some patience, it appears, will be required for all of these guys. Williams and his assistant, Rick Hahn, have done good work in securing long-term deals for the core of the big league team. The most important player eligible for free agency next winter is Cliff Politte, the setup man.
All five starters and every regular are under White Sox control through 2007, at least. Several have deals through '08, and Paul Konerko and Jose Contreras have contracts that run even longer.
General managers all want options, and Williams should be in an enviable position at the trading deadline and into the next offseason. He's built his reputation trading prospects for established veterans but soon could find himself picking between veterans and prospects from his own organization.
"Having what is considered an excess is not necessarily a bad thing," Williams said after signing Contreras to his contract extension, which left no room in the organization for 6-foot-7 right-hander Brandon McCarthy, who shut down Texas, Boston and Cleveland in starts late last season. "I have no plans to move any of this starting pitching, no plan whatsoever. Fundamentally I don't think there's such thing as too much pitching."
No, but you can only use four starters in the playoffs. If the White Sox are sitting pretty on July 31, with all of their horses healthy (look for Contreras to spend the minimum 15 days in his current stay on the DL with back issues), another contender -- probably a National League contender -- could tempt Williams with an offer for one of his five.
Here's a look at some of the choices the White Sox are likely to face at some point in the next 18 months:
•  McCarthy, Tracey, Haeger, Broadway, Lumsden or Liotta for Freddy Garcia, Jon Garland or Javier Vazquez:  While Mark Buehrle and Garcia have the shortest contracts among the starters (Garcia is signed through 2007; the Sox have an '07 option on Buehrle), the only way Buehrle would be traded is if the club thinks his asking price on an extension is way too high. Contreras, who has carried the Sox to a 23-3 record in his last 26 starts, isn't going anywhere.
McCarthy, who got a spot start Tuesday in place of Contreras, has been important in a thin bullpen. But the bet here is somebody gets moved to open a spot for him in the rotation before next season.
A second trade next winter could create both payroll flexibility and hellish competition for the fifth starter's spot between the knuckleball-throwing Haeger (4-0, 0.59 ERA in seven starts at Charlotte), Tracey (4-0, 2.65 at Charlotte), Broadway (4-1, 1.42 at Birmingham), Lumsden (4-1, 2.91 at Birmingham) and Liotta (1-4, 3.59 at Birmingham).  Phillips (3-2, 2.43 at Charlotte), like first baseman Rogowski -- who is buried behind Konerko and Jim Thome -- could be trade fodder as Williams seeks bullpen help for the stretch run.


Fields

• Fields vs. Joe Crede:  More confident at the plate and spectacular in the field, Crede (who could have been the World Series MVP just as easily as Jermaine Dye) has turned into a rising star. He also represents a potential salary issue because he has two more years of arbitration remaining and Scott Boras as his agent.
The Sox could afford to pay Crede if they phased in one or two low-salaried pitchers in the rotation, but they have a potential replacement on his way in Fields. The former Oklahoma State quarterback was a first-round pick in 2004 and is sailing through the farm system. He's batting .345 and recently had five homers in a four-game stretch for Charlotte. He leads the International League in slugging and has shown marked improvement in his fielding after a 25-error season at Birmingham in 2005.
Fields once seemed to offer a bigger bat than Crede, but the five-year veteran was hitting .323-8-28 through the White Sox's first 37 games. Crede has also elevated his game under pressure. If the Sox can sign him to a long-term extension, Fields would become a valuable bargaining chip.


Owens



Sweeney

• Sweeney and Owens vs. Scott Podsednik and Brian Anderson:  Anderson is hitting only .181 as the center field replacement for Aaron Rowand, and Podsednik started this season off slowly before reasserting himself in May.
Owens, a former UCLA wide receiver, and Sweeney, a 21-year-old with a sweet swing whom Roland Hemond has compared to Harold Baines, are different style players. Owens, the Southern League batting champ a year ago, is a slasher who can fly. Sweeney (currently disabled with a tight hamstring) stands 6-5 and could become a high-average hitter. Either could get a long look if the Sox have an injury or Anderson regresses. Both were behind Chris Young until he was traded to Arizona in the Vazquez deal.


Stewart

•  Stewart vs. Chris Widger:  The experience Widger brings to his backup catcher's role has been invaluable,  but Stewart is a solid all-around player who is coming fast. He and Rogowski had big winters in the Dominican Republic, demonstrating their passion for the game. Because Widger is productive and inexpensive, Stewart might be little more than insurance behind the A.J. Pierzynski-Widger tandem the next couple of seasons.

As much as baseball people like Josh Phelps' numbers -- 18 homers and 58 RBI in just 74 games last year after his July 2 callup -- the Toronto DH might like numbers even more. How many guys in the big leagues dug calculus their senior year?
Phelps isn't your average big league power prodigy. Born in Alaska and raised in tiny Rathdrum, Idaho, he reads books -- real books! -- forsaking the standard clubhouse fare of "American Pie" and "Bonzo Goes to the Big Leagues." He graduated fourth in his Lakeland High class of 150 with a 3.94 grade point average. Manager Carlos Tosca jokes, "I just bought a new Cadillac, one of those ones where the seats adjust when you put the key in. I couldn't get it to work. He overheard me and said, 'For a minimal fee, I can set that up for you.' "
Phelps was going to pursue engineering in college before he signed with the Blue Jays as a 10th-round catcher in 1996. Now DHing behind first baseman Carlos Delgado, the 24-year-old stands an imposing 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds and has one of the most powerful, natural strokes among young major leaguers today. His numbers don't show it this year -- he's  batting just .214 with two home runs and three RBI through Thursday -- but anyone who saw Phelps mash a fifth-deck SkyDome home run in his first career at-bat against Roger Clemens last year knows this kid won't stay quiet for long.
Ironically, "quiet" is the best adjective for Phelps off the field, where he mostly keeps to himself, retaining his small-town Idaho roots. But he sat down recently with Alan Schwarz at Yankee Stadium as his promising career tries to hit its stride.
Question: What is it about mathematics that intrigues you?
Phelps: I used to really enjoy it. Unfortunately now if I had to tutor somebody through Algebra II I'd have to do a lot of re-learning. It was something I really enjoyed because it was so challenging. It never came easy by any means. For me, I always had to work at it. It always took a lot of extra effort to figure it out. There was always an answer. There was a right and a wrong. And there was a process you could go through to get the answer -- some cases, multiple ways. But you could always solve the problem. You get that cookie at the end.
Question: One of your strengths, I'm told, is your ability to quickly recognize pitch sequences and patterns. Does your interest in math play into that?
Phelps: I chalk it up more to tendencies, to tell you the truth. A lot of pitchers have the same tendencies, like habits. It's out of habit that they do certain things. I try to pick up other pitchers' tendencies -- this guy likes to start me out with a breaking ball with guys on base, stuff like that. These are things you try to learn when you've seen them enough times. It's definitely something that can only help you. The more perceptive you are, the better your chances of making the adjustment quicker than they do.
Question: Is it innate? Or do you use video?
Phelps: I try to pay attention. There's a little bit of video when I'm a little off, but it's mainly going on feeling. I like to break everything down step-by-step. It makes it easier to figure out what went wrong -- take A, B, C, D, which one didn't work? It's much easier to put things back in line.


Question: You seemed to figure out Roger Clemens pretty good last August, when you hit two home runs the first time you faced him -- one of them into the fifth deck at SkyDome. Vernon Wells said that guys in the dugout, their jaws just dropped. What happened that at-bat?
Phelps: It was a 1-2 count. I felt myself relax for some reason at that point in time. There was so much adrenaline in that first at-bat, I was swinging at pitches about head height, fastballs trying to foul off. During that pitch, I felt myself completely relax for some reason. I wish I could bottle that and sell it. When you're locked in you're locked in -- I really can't explain it.
Question: Then on Opening Day this year, Roger hits you with his first pitch.
Phelps: That's an enormous compliment -- after the fact. I did everything right when I hit those two home runs. I did everything right -- I ran hard around the bases, I didn't show anybody up. I don't know if he did it on purpose. If it was an accident, then it means nothing. But if it wasn't, that's a little different. That's OK. If you'd rather hit me with guys on first and second than pitch to me to make your point, whatever.
Question: I'm sure you know that you're only 29 hits behind the all-time leader for hits by players born in Alaska. Do you know who that is?
Phelps: No idea.
Question: It's Curt Schilling. I imagine there's some Alaskan pride pulsing through you just thinking about passing him.
Phelps: He was born in Alaska, huh? I only spent maybe six or seven months as an Alaska native before we moved. I consider myself from Idaho. There's a lot more hits to take that record -- everyone from there knows that Harmon Killebrew is from Payette, Idaho, and the 573 home runs. So it'll take quite a bit to get into the books in Idaho.
For a while I didn't know that he was from there. Major league baseball isn't a pulsating, big-time sport in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The closest team was Seattle and when I was growing up they were terrible.
Question: I imagine the weather in northern Idaho wasn't too conducive to baseball.
Phelps: High school season is like 25 games -- that's including your district and state tournaments. That's not much compared to Florida and Texas and California. We're way behind in that respect. Summerball we'd drive 4-5 hours, sometimes seven hours to get to Boise for the state tournament. And in Idaho you have a lot of mountains -- there's no real direct route anywhere.
Question: You did a lot of skiing. Were you a better ballplayer or skier?
Phelps: In high school, probably skier. I wasn't that crazy. I didn't have that no-fear attitude that a lot of my friends shared. They'd go jumping off cliffs, stuff like that. I was like, "If I don't land that, I know it's gonna hurt." I wasn't too wild and crazy and all.
Question: Speaking of hobbies, what do you like to read?
Phelps: I like action-adventure, murder mysteries, stuff like that. I'm reading Harlan Coben, "Tell No One" right now. I have favorite authors. Patrick McManus -- he's an author from Idaho. He writes for Outdoor Life, short stories, stuff like that. I like to read Dean Koontz -- more of his earlier stuff than his later stuff. I like to read James Patterson books, too. To kill time here at the ballpark, I'd rather do that than watching a movie. To me, reading a good book, I can picture the movie in my head.
Question: What position do you prefer playing -- DH, first base or catcher?
Phelps: At this point in time I just want to be a major leaguer. I don't feel like I'm in the position to demand anything. I used to love to catch. I don't know if that's in the future or not. I don't have enough experience at first base to know if it's something I'd like to do for the next 10 years. It's something I'd like to do. And I think I'd be able to catch. But honestly, it doesn't matter to me. DHing's OK. I enjoy it.
Question: Are you concerned about being pigeon-holed as a one-dimensional player so early in your career?
Phelps: A little bit. But man, DHing's one heck of a job. All I'm responsible for is hitting. I don't have to go out there and beat myself up mentally or physically behind the plate all game long. It's not as bad of a racket as people make it out to be.
Question: I heard you had a bit of a hitch behind the plate at Triple-A Syracuse last year, having a hard time throwing the ball back to the pitcher.


Phelps: It was more throwing to second base between innings. During the game it was more something that reaction could take over. But some people just develop that mind block and then you start worrying about it, and it snowballs on you -- until you have a chance to step back and relax. When you're stressing out about things, sometimes you just try to damn hard.
Question: Is it thinking too much? That's a label that gets put on smarter players.
Phelps: Definitely, that's part of it. You beat yourself up over and over and over again -- "Why can't I figure this out? Why not this? Why not that?" You do think too much.
It was tough for me this spring training. It was the first time I haven't had to carry around a catcher's bag. You start to feel a little guilty seeing your catching buddies carrying all their stuff, and I'm like cake-walking through, taking ground balls and BP.
Question: Is your slow start at the plate this year from thinking too much?
Phelps: Right now, my feeling is sooner or later somebody's gonna have to pay. I can't press today because I didn't get four hits yesterday. I take a pretty logical standpoint to it -- as long as I'm in a good position mechanically, if I do the things I want to do, if I go out there with a plan every day, and there's a positive mindset, hits are gonna come. Good things are gonna happen.
Question: As a math fan, do you just chalk two bad weeks up to randomness?
Phelps: It's definitely random. I know for a fact that I can be feeling great and hit 10 balls hard on the nose and hit those 10 balls right to people. 0-for-10. How else do you explain that? And you can be feeling terrible -- "I hope I just get a bleeder today," something like that -- and just out of luck, fate, randomness, whatever you call it, you get three hits. You can't put too much stock in things that you have no control over.
I've never gotten off to a good start -- even in the minor leagues. I don't know what it's like to come out of the gate hitting .450, .500. But I do know how to persevere and I do know how to work hard and keep going.

I find this entire exercise utterly depressing.
My assignment is to fall on the grenade and explain why Fred McGriff doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame. There have been harder rhetorical tasks, frankly. Proving why McGriff should buy his own ticket to Cooperstown is easier than keeping Franklin Pierce off Mount Rushmore.
But with McGriff teetering toward his 500th career home run -- the Tampa Bay local artifact has 493 -- talk has begun to stir that his following Ken Griffey Jr. into 500 territory would automatically cast his mug in Hall of Fame bronze; after all, the argument goes, every one of the 15 eligible retirees with that many homers has received the honor. Ever since Cooperstown's groundbreaking, a player hitting 500 home runs meant he could waltz into the Hall. Yet in today's power-charged era we were bound to come across a player who would still trip over the molding. His name is Fred McGriff.
Now, the disturbing part comes in the fact Fred McGriff has been a very good ballplayer for most of the past 18 years. For seven of them, 1988-94, he was one of the top five offensive forces in baseball. Explaining why he doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame is like telling a Harvard magna cum laude grad, "What, you couldn't make summa?" Give the guy a break, after all.
However, Fred McGriff's feelings, and those of his several fans, need to be protected less than the majesty of the Hall of Fame -- which would be diluted, however slightly, by his inclusion. It seems to me that the Hall (gallery, not museum) exists to honor the best players of all time, with each era (the dead-ball teens, the homer-happy '30s) being fairly represented. To accomplish this, the "best" must be defined not just as the elite among all-time standouts, but among their contemporaries as well. This is where McGriff hits his ceiling.
Again, McGriff has had a very impressive career. Seems to me his qualifications for Hall of Fame inclusion should be the following, in order of significance:
1) (Presumably) 500 or more home runs. For better or worse, this remains a magic number. While we must be skeptical about modern home run totals, which have skyrocketed across the board the last decade, it should be remembered that McGriff enjoyed many of his best years before that inflation. With that in mind ...
2) He was a good all-around hitter, not just a longball guy. For seven seasons (1988-94) McGriff's combined .935 OPS was the third-best in baseball, behind only Frank Thomas (1.040) and Barry Bonds (.967). That's pretty darned good, something I was surprised to discover.
3) The players with the most similar statistics to him, according to the Bill James formula employed by baseball-reference.com, are, in order, Willie McCovey, Willie Stargell, Rafael Palmeiro, Andres Galarraga, Billy Williams, Jeff Bagwell, Chili Davis, Eddie Mathews, Dwight Evans and Ernie Banks. Five of those 10 are in the Hall of Fame, with one or two more probably joining them in time.
4) He was a five-time All-Star, a two-time home run leader, a key player for one of the 1990's top two teams (the Braves), and was mentioned by Cosmo Kramer during a Steinbrenner rant.
So there's no denying that this was a very notable player. The problem comes when you investigate just how high he rose over his peers. Was he one of the best players of his time? Or did a rising tide raise him? With that in mind, consider the following:
1) McGriff was never once considered one of the top three players in his league, according to the MVP voting. He finished fourth only once, in 1993, and placed in the top eight just three other times. While this doesn't instantly KO his candidacy -- Richie Ashburn finished in the top 10 just twice, both times at No. 7 -- it remains a huge blow to his credentials.
2) The similarity scores that compare McGriff to McCovey and Stargell rely only on raw numbers, and take no account of the era in which the players played. McCovey and Stargell, both Hall of Famers, hit most of their thirtysomething homers a year in the 1960s and '70s, when high offensive totals were considerably harder to come by. McGriff started out in the pitching-heavy 1988-92 era but still padded his numbers after that.
3) How many first basemen from one era can go into the Hall? McGriff's career coincided all but perfectly with Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Frank Thomas and Jeff Bagwell. Each of those players will retire with better qualifications than McGriff. (We're not even counting Eddie Murray, who arrived before him, and the Thome-Delgado-Giambi-Helton group that followed.) Even if you grant that McGriff was the fifth best first baseman of his era -- and that's debatable -- that doesn't sound like a Hall of Famer to me.
Amateur scientists thrive in Hall of Fame arguments, brewing some of logic's more specious elixirs. Almost every player can be made to look Cooperstown-worthy if you look at only one category. In McGriff's case, some will tell you that he hit more home runs than Joe DiMaggio, had more RBI than Mickey Mantle and even a higher OPS than Harmon Killebrew. He has more World Series rings than Ted Williams and Ernie Banks combined. And, most of all, the guy went deep 500 times.
This basically comes down to how much stock you put in that one number -- 500 -- in terms of punching someone's Hall of Fame ticket. If McGriff finished with 472 home runs, the conversation would have no traction whatsoever. In this age of statistical understanding, should we allow one number to dictate a player's value and legacy? Of all the things we've learned about statistics these past 20 years, it's not just what they mean, but what they don't mean. And 500 homers don't mean enough anymore, even if they once did.
The Hall of Fame is not for outstanding players who flame out quickly. It isn't a rest home for very good players with longevity. And it isn't even about numbers.
It is about knighting the most elite players the game has ever seen, and Fred McGriff is not one of those. His magna degree will have to do.

Most fans, players and even team executives assume that baseball's infatuation with statistics is simply a byproduct of the information age, a phenomenon that blossomed only after the arrival of Bill James and computers in the 1980s. They couldn't be more wrong.
Alan Schwarz, the senior writer of Baseball America and a weekly contributor to ESPN.com, will forever change that misperception with his new book, "The Numbers Game," just published by St. Martin's Press. Schwarz provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime's birth in 1845, and telling the story of this obsession through the characters who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; George Lindsey, a Canadian military officer who spent hundreds of hours scoring games to figure out how often runners on second base score on a single; Hal Richman, who invented Strat-O-Matic baseball when he was 11 years old; and dozens more.
In this exclusive excerpt, Schwarz travels back to the early 1960s to profile the work of Earnshaw Cook, a kooky metallurgist (and consultant to the U.S. government's efforts to build the atom bomb), who retired to while away his days pursuing his theories about baseball statistics -- while Bill James was still in junior high. So you think baseball stats are just a modern fan fixation? Read on ...
Through the 1950s, college professors and graduate students began to pepper academic journals with sophisticated analyses of baseball. In 1952, Frederick Mosteller of Harvard University used binomial probability theory to prove that the best-of-seven World Series was a horribly unreliable way to determine baseball's champion. Four years later, an article in American Statistician discussed a method to adjust standings for the strength of each team's schedule. And in 1960, two Stanford grad students presented a paper to the American Statistical Association called "The Distribution of Runs in the Game of Baseball," which appears to be the first advanced attempt to combine the probabilities of hits, walks, outs, and more into a model of how runs score.
All these studies, however, were read only by tiny audiences, many of whom blanched at the idea of allowing so frivolous a subject as baseball into their otherwise important affairs. It would take a commercially published book to introduce statistical analysis of baseball beyond academia and to the more average fan. That book arrived in the summer of 1964: "Percentage Baseball," written by a bowtied Baltimore gentleman named Earnshaw Cook. More than a decade before Bill James' "Baseball Abstract" series began, Cook's "Percentage Baseball" became the first -- and perhaps most befuddling -- full-length book to be written on what we now call sabermetrics.
Cook was a most unlikely sort to devote four years to the study of baseball statistics. Gray-haired in his 60s, the stern and iron-faced Cook was an aristocrat at heart -- conservative to the core, constantly complaining about the "Japs" and inflation, and always, always wearing a smoking jacket, sport shirt, and tie (often a clip-on). He spoke with a faux English accent to lend an elitist aura, and his gruff bearing was so authoritative that his Chesapeake retriever would, on command, fetch the newspaper and then go to the closet and bring down his bedroom slippers. He signed all correspondence with his blueblood pedigree: "Princeton '21."
Cook had played varsity baseball at Old Nassau, and even was a distant cousin of George Earnshaw, the former big league pitcher, but went on to a distinguished career as a metallurgist, studying metals and their alloys down to the protons and electrons at their core, primarily for the American Brake Shoe Co. of Mahwah, N.J. He wrote "Engineering Properties of Heat Resistant Alloys" and other light classics. He served as a consultant on the Manhattan Project and for the Atomic Energy Commission before retiring in 1945 and ultimately nesting in a small estate in Baltimore. With little to occupy his time thereafter, other than training his dogs and playing golf at the nearby Elkridge Club, he decided to prove, once and for all, damn it, that Ty Cobb was better than Babe Ruth.
This Cobb-versus-Ruth, slapper-versus-slugger debate had raged for generations and became almost religious for each sect's most ardent followers. Cobb was the master of the single-and-speed game prevalent during his prime of 1907 to 1922, ringing up a .366 lifetime batting average (still the all-time major league record) and 892 stolen bases (a mark that lasted almost 50 years). Ruth's awesome power diverted focus from batting average to home runs, much to the chagrin of fans clinging to the game's original style. Cobb himself complained in a letter in 1952, "Now they have gone to the hit per distance game. They look as if they will be lucky to hit .340 or maybe less . . . The hit and run, stolen base, bunt, and sacrifice are deteriorating from unuse and they only hit for their amusement and pleasure for the home run." Everyone agreed that a home run was more valuable than a single, but by how much? To what extent did stolen bases and the venerable sacrifice aid in the scoring of runs? Come to think of it, what was the optimal lineup order? How should relief pitchers be used? Cook didn't want to go "by the book," blindly accepting the time-honored answers to these questions -- so he wrote a book of his own. In fits and starts over several years, Cook holed up in his study, overlooking the golf course, and pounded on baseball statistics. His slide rule and colored pencils stood at attention above his angled drafting table, piles of The Sporting News and its "Baseball Register" at the ready.
In his spare time, Cook used his research to teach math to his teenaged nephew, Bryson. Bryson returned the favor with one heck of a public relations coup. Bryson Cook's best friend was a kid named Gil Deford, whose big brother Frank had just, as luck would have it, graduated from college and begun writing for Sports Illustrated. Frank Deford learned of this quirky baseball scientist and mentioned him to his editor, who dispatched the young writer to interview Cook during the winter of 1964. The editor liked the piece so much he made it the lead feature story of the March 23 issue, with the headline "BASEBALL IS PLAYED ALL WRONG."
Deford breathlessly previewed Cook's discoveries: The sacrifice was generally worthless. Platooning was a waste of time. Sluggers should bat first. Games should be started by a "relief " pitcher who would leave for a pinch hitter at the first opportunity, followed by a "starting"-caliber pitcher who would then pitch four or five innings. All this, Cook claimed, would add a total of 250 runs and perhaps 25 wins to a team each season, numbers clearly absurd today but in 1964 as arresting as a Bob Gibson fastball at the noggin. "Right now," Deford gushed in his four-page article, "Earnshaw Cook knows more about baseball than anyone else in the world."
Cook asserted that by employing his theories, a .500 club could instantly become a pennant winner. Deford naturally presented baseball personnel as being alarmed, even humbled, by these findings. "If these figures are correct," Dodgers manager Walter Alston told SI, "Cook must have something  Maybe we've just been playing what we assumed was the proper way." Bill Veeck, the renegade owner of the White Sox, loved the idea of minimizing at-bats by weak-hitting pitchers. "By all means," Veeck raved, "get the pitcher out of there!" But privately most team personnel brushed Cook's theories aside. Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Arthur Daley wrote, "It is highly unlikely that Cook, the iconoclast, will influence one manager to alter his pattern to the slightest degree  What was good enough for John McGraw is good enough for them."
The recalcitrance of baseball executives only hardened when Cook's full-length book, "Percentage Baseball," came out a few months later. It was barely intelligible to even educated readers; beyond sprinkling the text with haughty Latin phrases and quotations from the likes of Francis Bacon, Cook might as well have put a statistics textbook in a blender. Pages of graphs, equations, and probabilistic gibberish, such as:
Eqv. p.SHS.y    =    1.1564 DX.y + 1.4370 DX.z + .1507 divided by 2.3225 DX.z + .2477
made much of his methodology hopelessly inaccessible. (This surely added to Cook's aura as a sort of baseball Merlin. His hometown Baltimore Sun would consult him for pennant-race predictions -- "projections," he insisted -- and use headlines such as "BIRDS TO FINISH 3D, STATISTICIAN DECLARES," and "COOK, BASEBALL'S SEER, IS PITCHING ORIOLES.") Cook loved the attention. While beguiling readers with a blizzard of figures and charts, "Percentage Baseball" represented the first comprehensive effort to model all aspects of baseball through applied probability theory, and was met with apprehensive awe.
Cook rooted his approach in a statistic he developed called the Scoring Index. He examined the relative chances of all offensive events -- single, double, sacrifice, steal, and so on -- and all the ways they can be strung together to score runs before three outs end an inning. (For example, a single can be followed by two straight outs, a steal, and a single. Or a batter can reach on an error and jog home on a later batter's home run, etc ) Cook concluded that the probability of scoring a run was proportional to the chances of reaching first base multiplied by the chances of advancing that runner. His final formula looked like this:
p.R = (K) × (p.H + p.BB + p.E.o + p.HB - 2p.SH - p.XBH) × (p.TB)
This equation, however disguised in ugly and cumbersome notation, was actually rooted in concepts some 20 to 30 years ahead of general acceptance. K was just a numerical constant. Each "p." merely denoted the probability of the event that followed it (for example, p.BB meant the probability of a base on balls, i.e., walks per plate appearance) so the entire equation can be seen as having plate appearances (PA) as its denominator. Ignoring errors and the subtraction of sacrifices and extra-base hits for the moment, the right-hand side's two terms reduce to:
(H + BB + HB) * (TB)
			          PA  	 	PA
This is far more recognizable to modern fans of statistics: It's effectively the product of on-base percentage and slugging percentage, and greatly resembles the approach Bill James took to developing his renowned Runs Created formula in the late 1970s.
Armed with his scoring index and other statistical tools, Cook examined dozens of baseball strategies and trends. Summarizing them here would require another entire book. But these were the most significant matters Cook analyzed, with his conclusions:
The best hitter ever: Lo and behold, Ty Cobb, with a scoring index of .2161, beat out Babe Ruth (.2109), Ted Williams (.1962), Lou Gehrig (.1828) and Mickey Mantle (.1743). Cobb's score was actually .1574, but Cook, citing how Cobb had performed mostly in the dead-ball era when home runs were very rare, adjusted his figure upward by comparing his performance to that of his contemporaries. Cobb and Ruth, at the time widely considered the best two hitters ever, had never before stood Nos. 1 and 2 in any statistic. Scoring index let them rise to the top.
The base-out matrix: How many runs score after any point in an inning? For example, Cook's probability equations figured that with one out and runners on first and second, an average of .92 runs were bound to score. Here are his figures for each of the 24 possible situations:
BASES OCCUPIED
  0	  1	  2	   3	 1,2	 1,3	 2,3      Full
OUTS	0      |	.34	.77	.94	1.04	1.36	1.46	1.63	2.06

The stolen base: Cook determined that an average runner trying to swipe second base typically was a bad risk with none or one out, but a good risk with two. Then he assessed how the breakeven points fluctuated depending on the abilities of the runner on first and the hitter at the plate. For example, Minnie Minoso, the speedy outfielder for the White Sox, was successful in just 57 percent of his stolen-base attempts during 1960 and 1961; Cook claimed he should never run while any hitter with a .258 batting average or higher was up.

Alan Schwarz answered your questions about his new book in chat on Thursday.

The sacrifice bunt: Cook maintained that this was a bad play, except under certain conditions -- when a hitter was as poor as the typical pitcher, or when just one run was needed in the late innings of a close game. Outs were that precious. "There are two primary objects in baseball," Cook explained. "The first is to score runs. And the second is not to make outs." The latter concept didn't become understood by a majority of baseball executives for 35 years, and continues to baffle more than a few franchises.
The batting order: Most lineups put a speedster at the top, a bat-control artist second, and then the three best hitters third, fourth and fifth. But because roughly two-ninths of games end when the first or second batter makes the final out, the best hitters often miss a chance at another at-bat. Cook claimed that the lineup should always just put the best hitter first, followed by the second-best, and so on; even though sluggers such as Hank Aaron or Willie Mays might get fewer RBI because they would bat with fewer runners on base, that cost would be overcome by their getting roughly 40 more at-bats over the course of a season.
Platooning pitchers: Cook estimated that pitchers' horrible skills at the plate cost the average team 113 runs per season (of course there was yet no DH), and suggested that those hurlers virtually never be allowed to come to the plate at all. Given that complete games were becoming rarer in the early 1960s, Cook advocated starting a relief-caliber pitcher for two or three innings and pinch hitting for him at the first opportunity, and then using a starting-caliber pitcher to throw the next five innings or so, batting no more than once. Cook designed a 10-pitcher rotation to accomplish this.
Other assertions: Baseball's enlargement of the strike zone prior to the 1963 season had decreased offense up to 15 percent; a team's winning percentage should equal .484 times its ratio of runs scored to runs allowed; and the intentional walk is often a poor strategy, one that should be ordered, Cook wrote, "only if the actual 'DX.z' of the third batsman is less than his own equivalent 'DX.z'  "
Cook's rigorous mathematics ultimately failed him on both ends of the reader spectrum. Baseball fans were spooked by the intercept coefficients, distribution curves, and bizarre graphical techniques that recalled too many failed algebra quizzes. Professional statisticians, meanwhile, accused "Percentage Baseball" of sloppy and amateurish use of probability theory. "The book is easier reading for a baseball fan than for a mathematician," Scientific American sniffed. The military science journal Operations Research cited "very inadequate numerical evidence," "no tests of significance, fit or correlation," and other crimes. "Some of the mathematical presentations which form the heart of the book are atrocious," the review sneered. "Aside from a number of outright mistakes in manipulating probabilities  in a desperate attempt to relate [scoring index] to scoring the author is obliged to introduce a 'specific luck factor' that makes one's probability nerves twitch."
Cook did appeal, however, to a narrow band of audience: young, mathematically inclined fans who relished his application of probability to baseball, however flawed that application may have been. Several of them -- Carl Morris, Pete Palmer, Eric Walker, and more -- became noted academic and applied statisticians, and were heard from years later in the field of baseball analysis. It was Walker, in fact, who grew up to become Sandy Alderson's early statistics confidant in Oakland, and was the primary catalyst of baseball's modern on-base percentage craze.
Did major league executives pay attention to Cook at the time? Not really. Those who did were too young to have much influence in their traditionally stodgy industry. Tal Smith of the Houston Astros was a thirtysomething statistics buff who relished Cook's rigorous examination of accepted baseball opinion, but knew that altering that opinion was another matter altogether. "It was difficult to get anybody interested in any statistical information in the '60s -- they only wanted batting average and ERA and not to be bothered with it," recalled Smith, now president of the Astros. "Our general manager, Spec Richardson, was so statistically challenged that I'm not sure he knew what a batting average was. Managers in those days, most of them were old school. [Cook's approach] was nothing they were raised with. When I came across it there wasn't any way to put it into any practical effort."
Lou Gorman worked in the minor league department of the Baltimore Orioles in the late 1960s, knew of Cook's work from articles in the Sun, and after moving on to the expansion Kansas City Royals in 1969 kept a copy of "Percentage Baseball" on the shelf behind his desk. One day, the Royals' owner, Ewing Kauffman, noticed it.
"What is that?" he asked.
"It's a book a scientist wrote about baseball," Gorman said. "He analyzes lineups, strategies, and other things with hard-core math and statistics."
Kauffman, who made billions in the pharmaceutical industry, took the book in his hands and flipped through the pages. "I want you to have this guy call me collect," he told Gorman. "I want to meet him."
One month later, Kauffman sat down with Cook in the owner's suite at Kansas City's old Municipal Stadium. "Ewing loved the book and what Cook said in it," Gorman recalled, "but it never got to the point where he would use it to run the club. He stayed out of baseball decisions." Gorman, however, went on to a distinguished career with the Royals, Mariners, Mets, and Red Sox, always keeping "Percentage Baseball" in mind, and on his shelf.
At least one major league player took notice of "Percentage Baseball" and became an avid devotee. Davey Johnson, a young second baseman for the Orioles, just happened to also have a mathematics degree from Trinity University in Texas. Johnson read the book and noted that Cook lived in Baltimore, so he looked him up and visited his home. The two became friends, playing golf on occasion and always talking baseball. Johnson integrated some of Cook's ideas when he became a manager himself, leading the Mets to the 1986 World Series championship and later managing the Reds, Orioles and Dodgers. Johnson credits Cook with underscoring the importance of on-base percentage (rather than speed) at the top of batting orders and the inadvisability of intentional walks. "I'd played for a lot of managers who would just make out their lineup the old-fashioned way -- they didn't know what they were doing," Johnson remembered. "Cook showed how statistics could be used to run a ballclub better." In the end, the Times's Arthur Daley was proven wrong: Cook did influence a manager, a future one. Like most groundbreaking ideas, Cook's were appreciated most by people young enough not to feel threatened.
Cook himself did not witness the moderate influence he ultimately had. Eight years after the original publication of "Percentage Baseball" he followed up with a second volume, "Percentage Baseball and the Computer," in which he employed computer-simulation techniques to fine-tune, and usually validate, his theories. This book received considerably less attention than his first. In a 1975 letter Cook wrote, "At the age of 75, I do not expect to survive to witness any changes of attitude  It is my opinion that the application of basic statistical analysis will eventually receive the attention of professional baseball -- as it has in so many other fields of endeavor with increasing use of the ubiquitous digital computer." He spent a few years applying his mathematics to golf -- he tried to prove that the great Bobby Jones was better than newcomer Jack Nicklaus -- but ultimately discarded the idea. He died in late 1987 of a heart attack.
Before that, however, Cook was asked by the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown to donate the slide rule on which he did some of his calculations for "Percentage Baseball." "I am more than content," he typed in a note of appreciation, "to present my last testament herewith to the Greatest Game of them all."

Most fans, players and even team executives assume that baseball's infatuation with statistics is simply a byproduct of the information age, a phenomenon that blossomed only after the arrival of Bill James and computers in the 1980s. They couldn't be more wrong.
Alan Schwarz, the senior writer of Baseball America and a weekly contributor to ESPN.com, will forever change that misperception with his new book, "The Numbers Game," just published by St. Martin's Press. Schwarz provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime's birth in 1845, and telling the story of this obsession through the characters who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; George Lindsey, a Canadian military officer who spent hundreds of hours scoring games to figure out how often runners on second base score on a single; Hal Richman, who invented Strat-O-Matic baseball when he was 11 years old; and dozens more.
In this exclusive excerpt, Schwarz travels back to the early 1960s to profile the work of Earnshaw Cook, a kooky metallurgist (and consultant to the U.S. government's efforts to build the atom bomb), who retired to while away his days pursuing his theories about baseball statistics -- while Bill James was still in junior high. So you think baseball stats are just a modern fan fixation? Read on ...
Through the 1950s, college professors and graduate students began to pepper academic journals with sophisticated analyses of baseball. In 1952, Frederick Mosteller of Harvard University used binomial probability theory to prove that the best-of-seven World Series was a horribly unreliable way to determine baseball's champion. Four years later, an article in American Statistician discussed a method to adjust standings for the strength of each team's schedule. And in 1960, two Stanford grad students presented a paper to the American Statistical Association called "The Distribution of Runs in the Game of Baseball," which appears to be the first advanced attempt to combine the probabilities of hits, walks, outs, and more into a model of how runs score.
All these studies, however, were read only by tiny audiences, many of whom blanched at the idea of allowing so frivolous a subject as baseball into their otherwise important affairs. It would take a commercially published book to introduce statistical analysis of baseball beyond academia and to the more average fan. That book arrived in the summer of 1964: "Percentage Baseball," written by a bowtied Baltimore gentleman named Earnshaw Cook. More than a decade before Bill James' "Baseball Abstract" series began, Cook's "Percentage Baseball" became the first -- and perhaps most befuddling -- full-length book to be written on what we now call sabermetrics.
Cook was a most unlikely sort to devote four years to the study of baseball statistics. Gray-haired in his 60s, the stern and iron-faced Cook was an aristocrat at heart -- conservative to the core, constantly complaining about the "Japs" and inflation, and always, always wearing a smoking jacket, sport shirt, and tie (often a clip-on). He spoke with a faux English accent to lend an elitist aura, and his gruff bearing was so authoritative that his Chesapeake retriever would, on command, fetch the newspaper and then go to the closet and bring down his bedroom slippers. He signed all correspondence with his blueblood pedigree: "Princeton '21."
Cook had played varsity baseball at Old Nassau, and even was a distant cousin of George Earnshaw, the former big league pitcher, but went on to a distinguished career as a metallurgist, studying metals and their alloys down to the protons and electrons at their core, primarily for the American Brake Shoe Co. of Mahwah, N.J. He wrote "Engineering Properties of Heat Resistant Alloys" and other light classics. He served as a consultant on the Manhattan Project and for the Atomic Energy Commission before retiring in 1945 and ultimately nesting in a small estate in Baltimore. With little to occupy his time thereafter, other than training his dogs and playing golf at the nearby Elkridge Club, he decided to prove, once and for all, damn it, that Ty Cobb was better than Babe Ruth.
This Cobb-versus-Ruth, slapper-versus-slugger debate had raged for generations and became almost religious for each sect's most ardent followers. Cobb was the master of the single-and-speed game prevalent during his prime of 1907 to 1922, ringing up a .366 lifetime batting average (still the all-time major league record) and 892 stolen bases (a mark that lasted almost 50 years). Ruth's awesome power diverted focus from batting average to home runs, much to the chagrin of fans clinging to the game's original style. Cobb himself complained in a letter in 1952, "Now they have gone to the hit per distance game. They look as if they will be lucky to hit .340 or maybe less . . . The hit and run, stolen base, bunt, and sacrifice are deteriorating from unuse and they only hit for their amusement and pleasure for the home run." Everyone agreed that a home run was more valuable than a single, but by how much? To what extent did stolen bases and the venerable sacrifice aid in the scoring of runs? Come to think of it, what was the optimal lineup order? How should relief pitchers be used? Cook didn't want to go "by the book," blindly accepting the time-honored answers to these questions -- so he wrote a book of his own. In fits and starts over several years, Cook holed up in his study, overlooking the golf course, and pounded on baseball statistics. His slide rule and colored pencils stood at attention above his angled drafting table, piles of The Sporting News and its "Baseball Register" at the ready.
In his spare time, Cook used his research to teach math to his teenaged nephew, Bryson. Bryson returned the favor with one heck of a public relations coup. Bryson Cook's best friend was a kid named Gil Deford, whose big brother Frank had just, as luck would have it, graduated from college and begun writing for Sports Illustrated. Frank Deford learned of this quirky baseball scientist and mentioned him to his editor, who dispatched the young writer to interview Cook during the winter of 1964. The editor liked the piece so much he made it the lead feature story of the March 23 issue, with the headline "BASEBALL IS PLAYED ALL WRONG."
Deford breathlessly previewed Cook's discoveries: The sacrifice was generally worthless. Platooning was a waste of time. Sluggers should bat first. Games should be started by a "relief " pitcher who would leave for a pinch hitter at the first opportunity, followed by a "starting"-caliber pitcher who would then pitch four or five innings. All this, Cook claimed, would add a total of 250 runs and perhaps 25 wins to a team each season, numbers clearly absurd today but in 1964 as arresting as a Bob Gibson fastball at the noggin. "Right now," Deford gushed in his four-page article, "Earnshaw Cook knows more about baseball than anyone else in the world."
Cook asserted that by employing his theories, a .500 club could instantly become a pennant winner. Deford naturally presented baseball personnel as being alarmed, even humbled, by these findings. "If these figures are correct," Dodgers manager Walter Alston told SI, "Cook must have something  Maybe we've just been playing what we assumed was the proper way." Bill Veeck, the renegade owner of the White Sox, loved the idea of minimizing at-bats by weak-hitting pitchers. "By all means," Veeck raved, "get the pitcher out of there!" But privately most team personnel brushed Cook's theories aside. Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Arthur Daley wrote, "It is highly unlikely that Cook, the iconoclast, will influence one manager to alter his pattern to the slightest degree  What was good enough for John McGraw is good enough for them."
The recalcitrance of baseball executives only hardened when Cook's full-length book, "Percentage Baseball," came out a few months later. It was barely intelligible to even educated readers; beyond sprinkling the text with haughty Latin phrases and quotations from the likes of Francis Bacon, Cook might as well have put a statistics textbook in a blender. Pages of graphs, equations, and probabilistic gibberish, such as:
Eqv. p.SHS.y    =    1.1564 DX.y + 1.4370 DX.z + .1507 divided by 2.3225 DX.z + .2477
made much of his methodology hopelessly inaccessible. (This surely added to Cook's aura as a sort of baseball Merlin. His hometown Baltimore Sun would consult him for pennant-race predictions -- "projections," he insisted -- and use headlines such as "BIRDS TO FINISH 3D, STATISTICIAN DECLARES," and "COOK, BASEBALL'S SEER, IS PITCHING ORIOLES.") Cook loved the attention. While beguiling readers with a blizzard of figures and charts, "Percentage Baseball" represented the first comprehensive effort to model all aspects of baseball through applied probability theory, and was met with apprehensive awe.
Cook rooted his approach in a statistic he developed called the Scoring Index. He examined the relative chances of all offensive events -- single, double, sacrifice, steal, and so on -- and all the ways they can be strung together to score runs before three outs end an inning. (For example, a single can be followed by two straight outs, a steal, and a single. Or a batter can reach on an error and jog home on a later batter's home run, etc ) Cook concluded that the probability of scoring a run was proportional to the chances of reaching first base multiplied by the chances of advancing that runner. His final formula looked like this:
p.R = (K) × (p.H + p.BB + p.E.o + p.HB - 2p.SH - p.XBH) × (p.TB)
This equation, however disguised in ugly and cumbersome notation, was actually rooted in concepts some 20 to 30 years ahead of general acceptance. K was just a numerical constant. Each "p." merely denoted the probability of the event that followed it (for example, p.BB meant the probability of a base on balls, i.e., walks per plate appearance) so the entire equation can be seen as having plate appearances (PA) as its denominator. Ignoring errors and the subtraction of sacrifices and extra-base hits for the moment, the right-hand side's two terms reduce to:
(H + BB + HB) * (TB)
			          PA  	 	PA
This is far more recognizable to modern fans of statistics: It's effectively the product of on-base percentage and slugging percentage, and greatly resembles the approach Bill James took to developing his renowned Runs Created formula in the late 1970s.
Armed with his scoring index and other statistical tools, Cook examined dozens of baseball strategies and trends. Summarizing them here would require another entire book. But these were the most significant matters Cook analyzed, with his conclusions:
The best hitter ever: Lo and behold, Ty Cobb, with a scoring index of .2161, beat out Babe Ruth (.2109), Ted Williams (.1962), Lou Gehrig (.1828) and Mickey Mantle (.1743). Cobb's score was actually .1574, but Cook, citing how Cobb had performed mostly in the dead-ball era when home runs were very rare, adjusted his figure upward by comparing his performance to that of his contemporaries. Cobb and Ruth, at the time widely considered the best two hitters ever, had never before stood Nos. 1 and 2 in any statistic. Scoring index let them rise to the top.
The base-out matrix: How many runs score after any point in an inning? For example, Cook's probability equations figured that with one out and runners on first and second, an average of .92 runs were bound to score. Here are his figures for each of the 24 possible situations:
BASES OCCUPIED
  0	  1	  2	   3	 1,2	 1,3	 2,3      Full
OUTS	0      |	.34	.77	.94	1.04	1.36	1.46	1.63	2.06
OUTS	1      |	.18	.47	.63	.72	.92	1.01	1.17	1.46
OUTS	2      |	.07	.21	.32	.38	.46	.52	.64	.78
The stolen base: Cook determined that an average runner trying to swipe second base typically was a bad risk with none or one out, but a good risk with two. Then he assessed how the breakeven points fluctuated depending on the abilities of the runner on first and the hitter at the plate. For example, Minnie Minoso, the speedy outfielder for the White Sox, was successful in just 57 percent of his stolen-base attempts during 1960 and 1961; Cook claimed he should never run while any hitter with a .258 batting average or higher was up.

In 1992, David Nied changed baseball history.
Called up by the Braves for a September trial, Nied proceeded to give up just 10 hits in 23 innings, post a 1.17 ERA and advertise himself as one of the Braves' most promising arms. So promising that when Atlanta left him available in that November's expansion draft, the Rockies jumped all over him with the first overall pick.
Nied's great month didn't last -- he flamed out pretty quickly -- but the ultimate disappointment, it turns out, could be that his September mound debut doesn't even rank among the top 10 in baseball history.
Some kept up their dominance, some disappeared. Still more used that first big-league shot to make an immediate and indelible difference on the pennant race:
10. Roy Halladay, 1998 Blue Jays
The Jays' top pitching prospect, Halladay got pretty much lit by the expansion Devil Rays in his major league debut that September. But his second start one week later gave a hint of the Cy Young Award winner to come. Pitching against Detroit, Halladay stood one out away from a no-hitter when Bobby Higginson hit a solo home run. Halladay still won the game 2-1.
9. Steve Busby, 1972 Royals
Kansas City had a bunch of good young pitchers through the 1970s -- Paul Splittorff and Dennis Leonard among them -- but none looked as good as early as Busby. A former College World Series hero for Southern Cal, Busby reached the big leagues after just one full minor league season and immediately gave the Royals a taste of what was to come: He went 3-1, 1.58 and gave up just 28 hits in 40 innings. (And just before the DH came to the American League, he stroked a grand slam that was wiped out when the umpire said he had called time.) Busby stayed just as hot in '73 and '74, pitching no-hitters each season, but a string of injuries ultimately kept him from developing into the longtime star many expected.
8. Larry Jaster, 1965 Cardinals
A hard-throwing bonus baby known as "the Creeper" because he was so quiet, Jaster made a plenty loud debut in September 1965. He went 3-0, 1.61 in four appearances, completing all three of his starts. Making the St. Louis roster the following spring training, Jaster followed up with an 11-5, 3.26 season -- highlighted by five shutouts, all against the pennant-winning Dodgers.
7. Randy Johnson, 1988 Expos
In 1988, Johnson wasn't supposed to be a September callup -- the Expos planned to promote him in June from Triple-A Indianapolis before he broke his right hand punching a bat rack. Montreal finally got its first look at the 6-foot-10 prodigy in the season's final month, when he went 3-0, 2.42 in four starts, including a 9-1, 11-strikeout, complete-game win over the Cubs. Most encouragingly, the wild left-hander walked just seven batters in 26 innings. But Johnson wasn't ready yet -- his poor control landed him back in the minors the following spring, and we haven't heard from the guy since.
6. Nick Maddox, 1907 Pirates
A 20-year-old right-hander who had already thrown two no-hitters for the Central League's Wheeling club, Maddox twirled a 4-0 shutout over St. Louis in his first major league start for Pittsburgh that September -- and didn't slow down. One week later, he no-hit Brooklyn. He finished 5-1, 0.83 to earn a spot in the rotation the following year. Maddox made good on it, going 23-8 in 1908 and in 1909 helping the powerhouse Pirates to 110 wins and the World Series championship. Amazingly, Maddox was out of the majors only one season later.
5. Harry Coveleski, 1907 Phillies
We're cheating a bit here, but you'll soon see why. In 1907, Coveleski made a great September debut for the Phillies, pitching 20 shutout innings in four relief appearances. Perhaps not good enough to make this list. But the next year, Coveleski came up in September again, and all but decided the National League pennant race. Coveleski got four wins in five starts with a 1.24 ERA; with several of his starts thwarting the Giants' attempt to win the NL pennant, Coveleski earned the lasting nickname "The Giant Killer."
4. Fernando Valenzuela, 1980 Dodgers
The Fernandomania of 1981 caught many people by surprise, but he'd already given plenty of hints the previous September that he was something special. Pitching in relief at age 19 -- at least we think he was just 19 -- Valenzuela threw 17 2/3 shutout innings over 10 games, allowing just eight hits. It only got better, of course. After the winter, he finally did give up a run: only one in his first five starts of 1981, four of them shutouts and all of them wins. Fernandomania was born.
3. Karl Spooner, 1954 Dodgers
A top prospect summoned from Double-A Fort Worth -- where the hard-throwing left-hander led the Texas League with 21 wins and 262 strikeouts -- Spooner got only two starts after his callup to Brooklyn, and made spectacular success of both. On Sept. 22 he threw a 3-0 shutout over the Giants, striking out 15, six of them in a row. Four days later, on the last day of the season, Spooner blanked the Pirates 1-0 for two shutouts in two tries -- and was rewarded with an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. With incredible expectations entering 1955, Spooner hurt his arm that spring training, and never pitched in the majors again after the '55 World Series. Brooklynites still wonder what mighta been.
2. Francisco Rodriguez, 2002 Angels
After starting the season at Double-A Arkansas, Rodriguez made his major league debut on the late date of Sept. 18 but was so dominant in just 5 2/3 innings -- he gave up three hits with a ridiculous 13 strikeouts -- that the Angels used a loophole to add him to their postseason roster. Good move: Rodriguez made 11 appearances in the playoffs and World Series, going 5-1 with a 1.93 ERA with just 15 baserunners in 18 2/3 innings of stultifying middle relief. Almost certainly, Anaheim wouldn't have won the World Series without him.
1. Marty Bystrom, 1980 Phillies
The Phillies were a half-game back of the Expos on Sept. 10, 1980, when they inserted Bystrom, just a few days removed from his major league debut, into their rotation for the stretch drive. He proceeded to make all the difference: Bystrom shut out the Mets in that first start and won four of his others to go 5-0 with a 1.50 ERA, getting the Phillies to squeak past the Expos by just one game and win the NL East. Bystrom also started both Game 5s in the NLCS and World Series, and though he wasn't credited with wins, helped the Phillies win both games and, ultimately, their first World Series championship. Sadly, injuries kept Bystrom from being anywhere near as effective again, and he was out of the majors after 1985. His was September stardom at its best.

An old philosophy professor once said, "Dead philosophers aren't here to defend themselves." The implication was that those who were going to teach the subject had the duty to represent them fairly and defend their doctrines honorably.
As a panelist for the "DHL Presents MLB Hometown Heroes" program, I felt the same way about deceased and retired players. If, even as brief guardians of the game's history, we got it right, players long gone would smile and thank us if only they could. I think roughly 140 of the 150 picks (about 95 percent) that the panel and individual clubs turned over to the fans for a final vote were correct.
From Tuesday through Friday, the results of the Hometown Heroes contest will be announced on ESPN. The players chosen by fans as the best and those who embody the legacy of each of the 30 teams will be revealed.
Some choices seem like a foregone conclusion. Babe Ruth, still the game's standard bearer 58 years after his death, should win over fellow New York immortals Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra. Ted Williams, the most astute mind ever to analyze a pitcher, should emerge as the preeminent Bostonian. Arguably the most statistically persistent player of the last 50 years, Hank Aaron should be the Bravest. Maniacal or not, Ty Cobb rules Tigerland.
The panel -- and individual clubs, which had the last word -- included among its 150 candidates some obvious deceased players to choose from. These included can't-miss players whose lives have long since passed from playing fields into mythology -- including Ruth, Williams and Cobb. But others less mythical and just as deserving were overlooked.
Consider: Despite the panel's recommendations, five top-shelf Hall of Famers who made the "All-Century Team" seven years ago were missing from the final list of candidates because their former clubs did not choose them. Here is my ranking of the grandest omissions, starting with position players.
Rogers Hornsby (Cardinals)
Hornsby is the undisputed king of second basemen. No one at the position even approaches his .577 slugging mark, .434 on-base percentage and 1.021 OPS (on-base plus slugging). Ranked relative to his era, Hornsby's OPS makes him the fourth-greatest hitter of all time.
He hit .358, the second-highest career average to Cobb's .367. Moreover, he hit .402 (and slugged .690) over the five-year period from 1921 through 1925. As player-manager, he was heroic enough: He led St. Louis to its first world championship over Ruth and company in 1926. Even if Hornsby had been nominated, I suspect more modern players such as Stan Musial or Bob Gibson might have topped him on votes. Still, the "Rajah" deserved our remembrance.
The Cardinals did elect Albert Pujols, who looks like the real thing. But I would let the 26-year-old cool his heels for a time. Let him sustain his run of excellence and creep up on Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx as one of the great first sackers before we anoint him for immortality. Either Gibson, Lou Brock or Ozzie Smith could have vacated a seat for Hornsby, too.
Jimmie Foxx (A's)
Last week much ado was made of how David Ortiz eclipsed Foxx's Boston record of 50 home runs in a season. Broadcasters said nary a word about Foxx, who once belted 58 homers in a season for the Philadelphia A's. Is this all that lies ahead for "The Beast"? Will he be relegated to a dependent clause in someone else's sentence, a kind of historical footnote to another's achievements? It cannot happen.
While the Oakland offices rightly included Foxx's Philadelphia teammate, Lefty Grove, they inexplicably left off Foxx, whose .609 career slugging average ranks fourth (behind Ruth, Williams and Gehrig) and who knocked in 100 runs 13 times in a row, a feat equaled only by Gehrig.
I have no problem with Grove, Reggie Jackson, Rickey Henderson and Catfish Hunter. But under no circumstances should Double-X ride the pine to make room for Dennis Eckersley on the list of A's greats. He hit 415 home runs to lead the 1930s. With Foxx and mates Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane, the A's supplanted New York in 1929 as the team to beat. Foxx remains second only to Gehrig among all first basemen.
Eddie Mathews (Braves)
Could Mathews, who died just five years ago, be forgotten already? Mathews is no worse than the third-best third baseman of all time. Mike Schmidt is the consensus choice as tops at the position. Putting George Brett ahead of Mathews won't draw much protest. But no one else at third base other than Schmidt surpasses Eddie and his 512 home runs.
Mathews hit 40 home runs four times and played for the Milwaukee team that beat the Yankees in the 1957 Series and took them to seven games in 1958. Warren Spahn, the left-handed record holder with 363 wins, and Aaron had to make the Braves' best five, but Mathews -- who played for the Tribe in Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta -- easily leaps past third baseman Chipper Jones, not to mention other nominees John Smoltz and Phil Niekro.
Walter Johnson (Senators/Twins)
The Minnesotans forgot their Washington, D.C., roots. Although the Twins rightly selected 1960s home run leader Harmon Killebrew, who played his first seven years as a Senator, Killebrew hit 475 of his 573 home runs as a Minnesota Twin. And if they did remember the Senators, how could they leave out Johnson?
"The Big Train," the most famous Senator save Kennedy, won 417 games for a city affectionately known as "first in war, first in peace and last in American League." In 1924, at age 36, Johnson and Hall of Fame mate Goose Goslin led the Senators to their only world championship. Johnson topped the league in wins and ERA and earned his second MVP award. He won 20 more in 1925 and the Senators again made the series.
One of the original five elected to the Hall of Fame in 1936 (along with Ruth, Cobb, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson), Johnson was omitted while Kent Hrbek was included. Since Kirby Puckett was nominated, the Twins already had a representative from their two title teams, making Hrbek dispensable.
Christy Mathewson (Giants)
The other omitted pitcher from the original five Hall inductees was Mathewson. Sure, the Giants had a tougher lineup to crack: Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal and Mel Ott. But Mathewson should have edged Ott, the Giants' 5-foot-9 slugger who hit 323 of his 511 home runs (63 percent) at the lefty-friendly Polo Grounds.
Mathewson might be one of the top five hurlers ever. He pitched three shutouts in the 1905 series, ensuring the Giants' victory. He won 373 games, all but one with New York, between 1900 and 1916. Heroic? Matty joined a chemical warfare unit in France during WWI, got a whiff of gas and later contracted tuberculosis. He was just 45 when he died in 1925.
In addition to these historic omissions, the Expos-cum-Nationals, besides including Gary Carter and Rusty Staub, omitted Expo and borderline Hall of Famer Tim Raines, who gave way to Brian Schneider, Jose Vidro and Livan Hernandez.
That Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez did not draw nominations is likely attributed to the anti-steroids sensibility of the times, although only Palmeiro has tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.
No doubt my arguments will invite counterarguments. But that too is what the Hometown Heroes program is all about.

Useless John Santana Information
In case you haven't been paying attention to developments in the Central Time Zone, we have a new dominator on our hands. He's Twins left-hander Johan Santana. And his recent stretch of sheer unhittability includes all of these feats:
Santana has ripped off 10 straight starts of four hits or fewer and no more than two earned runs (in 6 IP-plus). And no other pitcher in the expansion era (1961-present) has had a streak that long of starts like that. The previous longest streaks, according to the Elias Sports Bureau:
1989 Mike Moore, A's, 8
2002 Andy Benes, Cardinals 7
1994 David West, Phillies 7
1973 Bill Parsons, Brewers 7
Santana just ran off another streak of seven straight games with nine strikeouts or more. Last pitcher to do that: Randy Johnson, in 2001. Even Nolan Ryan only had one streak like that in 26 years (11 in a row, May-July, 1977).
That stretch by Santana also included five straight double-figure strikeout games. That's not unprecedented, but only four other pitchers in the last 20 years have done it. Maybe you've heard of them:
Randy Johnson (seven times)
Pedro Martinez (six times)
Curt Schilling (five times)
Nolan Ryan (once)
Other amazing Santana feats:
* He made six starts in July -- and gave up a total of 14 hits.
* The poor schlubs who had to hit against him batted .095 in July.
* Going into his start Saturday, he'd given up three hits or fewer in seven straight starts.
* In 77 innings since June 15, he has almost four times as many strikeouts (102) as he has allowed hits (27).
Useless Diamondbacks Information
How 'bout those Diamondbacks? They just had the two longest losing streaks in the history of the franchise (11 and 14 games) -- and not just in the same season. They had them in a span of 34 games.
To find the last team to have two losing streaks that long that close together, according to Elias, you have to go all the way back to Casey Stengel's beloved 1963 Mets.
That Mets team lost 15 in a row from June 28-July 14, then started an 11-game losing streak four days later. But we're betting Casey had a lot more funny quotes than Al Pedrique.
Including those two semi-endless losing streaks, the Diamondbacks played 34 games between June 18 and July 25 -- and won four of them. The East Valley Tribune's Ed Price reports that only four other teams in the last 60 years have had a streak worse than 4-30:
2002 Orioles (4-32)
1996 Tigers (4-31 and 4-32)
1982 Twins (4-33 twice)
1949 Senators (4-34)
Thanks to the All-Star break and that 14-game losing streak, the Diamondbacks went a scary 18 days between wins -- from July 8 to July 26. In between wins, according to Ed Price, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 278.37 points.
Price also reports that the Diamondbacks have done something we bet very few teams have ever done:
They have gone more than a month without ever gaining on the leader in their division on any day. Since they pulled within 15 games of first on July 4, they've either lost ground or stayed the same every day since. Hard to do.
And one more incredible Diamondbacks trick from Price: They're just the second team in the division-play era -- and fourth since 1940 -- to lose 11 straight one-run games. They haven't won one since June 11.
The other teams to do that: 1983 Angels (11), 1967 A's (11) and 1958 Tigers (14).
Really Useless Information
In case you hadn't noticed the strange saga of Diamondbacks rookie Edgar Gonzalez, in each of his first three starts this year, his team lost by exactly the same score (10-3). (Then he broke the monotony with a 10-2 loss in his fourth start.)
We couldn't stop ourselves from asking the Elias Sports Bureau to look this up. And it found Gonzalez was the first pitcher in history whose team lost three straight starts by precisely the same score, and lost those games by at least seven runs. Amazing.
About 3 trillion readers thought it was truly spectacular that the Reds and Astros played a game last Friday that got suspended -- and when it resumed the next day, the winning pitcher (Cincinnati reliever Josh Hancock) was a guy who was playing for a different team (the Phillies) when the game began.
With the help of Retrosheet founder Dave Smith, we went through all the suspended games since 1989 -- and couldn't find any instance in which the winning pitcher in any game was someone who had been playing for another team when that game started. So we guess we'll keep searching.
Nevertheless, it reminds us of the greatest suspended-game feat we ever heard of:
In a suspended game in the International League in 1986, a guy named Dale Holman managed to get a hit for both teams (Richmond and Syracuse) in the same game. And that's a record, we can safely say, that will never be broken.
Has anybody figured out that Rangers offense? They're on a pace to score nearly 900 runs. Yet there have already been two occasions this year where they've been shut out in back-to-back games (May 26-27 by the White Sox, and July 27-28 by the Angels).
Well, we knew it was rare for a lineup that potent to do something like that. But we didn't know how rare, until Elias looked it up.
The last team to score 850 runs in a season but still get shut out back-to-back twice? It was, of course, Charlie Frisbee's 1899 Boston Beaneaters. They did it twice and still scored 858 runs that year.
As long as we're talking back-to-back shutouts, two teams just threw them on exactly the same days (July 21-22). That was the Cardinals (vs. Milwaukee) and the White Sox (vs. Cleveland).
It had been 12 years, according to Elias, since that happened. And, in a note that sums up just how bizarre baseball can be, the last time it did, three teams threw back-to-back shutouts on the same days (July 17-18, 1992):
Orioles (vs. Texas), Mets (vs. San Francisco), Braves (vs. Houston).
More Useless Shutout Info: Carlos Silva twirled a fascinating 11-hit complete-game shutout against the Angels on Tuesday, complete with six double-play balls.
Retrosheet.org's Dave Smith reports it's the first six-DP shutout in the division-play era. But how about all those hits?
Last 11-hit complete-game shutout: May 6, 2000 -- Curt Schilling (Phillies) over the Braves.
Last complete-game shutout in which a pitcher allowed more hits than that: June 2, 1998 -- a Dennis Martinez 12-hitter, for the Braves, over the Brewers.
Most hits ever allowed in a complete-game shutout: 15, by Walter Johnson (in 15 innings), on July 3, 1913 (Senators over Red Sox).
Really, Really Useless Info
What is it about guys named Abbott who pitch for the Phillies?
In 1992, they acquired Kyle Abbott from the Angels, and it took him 14 starts to win a game. This year, they signed Paul Abbott, and it took him eight starts to win a game.
Combined record of those two Abbotts as Phillies starters (through Thursday): 2-19 in 28 starts, with a 5.22 ERA.
There's something about Mark Bellhorn that fascinates us. His batting average is only .256, but his on-base percentage is .373. Here in the 2000s, just three other players have had an on-base percentage at least that high but an average at least that low:


But those guys aren't very Bellhorn-esque. So the last player to have a season like Mark Bellhorn was, well, Mark Bellhorn -- as a Cub, in 2002 (.258 average, .374 OBP).
Angels reliever Kevin Gregg threw four wild pitches in one inning July 25. So how hard is that?
His teammate, Brendan Donnelly, has spent three years in the big leagues, faced 585 hitters and thrown 2,398 pitches -- and has thrown just two wild pitches in his career.
At least Alfonso Soriano treats all his ex-teammates equally. On July 4, he hit a home run off Andy Pettitte. Ten days later, in the All-Star Game, he hit a home run off Roger Clemens.
When the Indians put a 14 on the scoreboard July 20, then gave up exactly 14 the next day, it seemed like more of a football feat than a baseball feat. But since the Browns resumed life in the NFL in 1999, they've scored 14, then allowed 14 the next game just once -- in Weeks 5 and 6 of the 2001 season (vs. the Bengals and Ravens).
It's usually a good thing to hit four home runs in one game -- but not if you're the Mets. Counting their 19-10 loss in Montreal on July 27, they're now 3-4 this year in games in which they homer four times. The other 29 teams are 81-26.
The Elias Sports Bureau reports that the Mets have tied the prestigious NL record for most losses in a season when homering at least four times. They share it with the 1970 Padres, 1995 Rockies and 1999 Rockies. The major-league record is five, by the 1987 Indians.
Loyal reader Noah Veltman watched Barry Bonds whiff twice in a July 15 Giants-Rockies game and wondered how often that's happened. Well, less often than a full moon, anyway.
Since June 23, 2003, Bonds has had exactly three multi-strikeout games (last Sept. 27 against the Dodgers, April 7 vs. the Astros and that July 15 game). In the same span, he has had 75 multi-walk games and 19 multi-intentional-walk games.
As Miguel Tejada heads for somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 RBI and 30 homers, loyal reader Justin Fenton wonders what the record is for biggest gap between homers and RBI in a season.
The modern record (an incredible 143) is held by Hank Greenberg, who knocked in 183 runs in a 40-homer season in 1937. But since the 1940s, only three players have accumulated 120 more RBIs than homers:
Vern Stephens, 1949 (159 RBI, 39 HR, PLUS-120)
Tommy Davis, 1962 (153 RBI, 27 HR, PLUS-126)
Manny Ramirez, 1999 (165 RBI, 44 HR, PLUS-121)
The amazing Ichiro Suzuki just had his second 50-hit month of the season (he also did it in May) -- and third of his career.
Last player before this to have two 50-hit months in one season, according to Elias: Joe Medwick, in July and August, 1936.
Last player with three 50-hit months in a career: Pete Rose. Except it took Rose 17 seasons. It has taken Ichiro a little more than 3 ½.
They moved the fences back in San Juan this year before the Expos launched their 21-game schedule there. And you might say the hitters noticed.
Expos media-relations whiz John Dever reports that Expos right-handed hitters hit zero home runs in those 21 games.
Strange but true: On July 20, the Blue Jays and A's played a 14-inning game in less time (3 hours, 39 minutes) than it took the Red Sox and Mariners to play a nine-inning game (3:50).
When the Padres told Jake Peavy to throw strikes July 21, he apparently took that literally. Loyal reader Mark Thoma reports that, in one stretch in the fifth and sixth innings, he threw 22 strikes in a row to seven different hitters.
Then, of course, he ended the streak by throwing four straight balls to Michael Tucker.
Devil Rays PR genius Rick Vaughn reports that it took five games for the Devil Rays to beat Kevin Brown this season. But when he finally did lose July 25, it wasn't to the Rays' big-league team. It was to their farm team in the New York-Penn League, the Hudson Valley Renegades.
Brown gave up four runs to them in six innings. In four starts against the major-league Devil Rays, he's 4-0, with a 1.88 ERA.
In the most historic pitching matchup of the month, that July 19 Orioles-Royals game featured Sidney Ponson (who had lost nine straight starts) vs. Brian Anderson (who had lost eight straight starts).
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was only the fourth time in history that two pitchers who had lost that many starts in a row faced each other -- and the first since 1907. The others:
Aug. 13, 1907 -- Art Fromme, Cardinals (8) vs. Irv Young, Braves (9)
July 3, 1906 - Frank Kitson, Senators (8) vs. Joe Harris, Red Sox (9)
Sept. 30, 1902 - Henry Thielman, Giants (12) vs. Roscoe Miller, Reds (10)
And the winner was ... Ponson (Orioles 7, Royals 4). Amazingly, neither of them has lost a game since.
Boxscore Lines of the Month
WALKATHON DIVISION
Cardinals pitcher Jeff Suppan, July 28 vs. the Reds:
4 2/3 IP, 5 H, 6 R, 6 ER, 10 BB, 2 K, 1 HR, 1 WP, 118 pitches (more than half of them balls) to get 14 outs. And after all that, his team won (11-10).
Last pitcher before Suppan to walk 10 in a game: Jason Jennings (Rockies) vs. the Padres on Sept 8, 2002 (in 5 1/3 1 IP).
Last pitcher to walk 10 and not even make it through five innings: Scott Ruffcorn (Phillies) vs. the Marlins on June 24, 1997 (in 4 1/3 1 IP), in a game his team also won.
Last Cardinals pitcher to walk 10 or more: Steve Carlton vs. the Giants on July 3, 1971 (10 BB in 5 2/3 2 IP).
15-HITTER DIVISION
Rockies pitcher Jason Jennings, July 20 vs. the Padres:
6 IP, 15 H, 9 R, 9 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 2 HR, 1 HBP.
Last pitcher to toss a 15-hitter, according to retrosheet.org: Barry Zito vs. the Devil Rays, on July 8, 2003.
Last National League right-hander to give up 15 hits or more: Bob Forsch (18 hits in RELIEF) vs. the Reds, on Aug. 30, 1989.
Last pitcher to give up more than 15 hits: Mike Oquist (A's) vs. the Yankees on Aug. 30, 1998 (16 hits in 5 IP).
MYSTERY-PITCHER DIVISION
Our old friend, Todd Zeile, sure screwed up his 0.00 career ERA on July 26, when he wandered into a 14-8 game in Montreal and unfurled this epic performance:
1 IP, 4 H, 5 R, 5 ER, 2 BB, 0 K, one career ERA that inflated to 22.50 by the time he left the mound.
With the help of Elias, we determined that Zeile was only the ninth position player in the division-play era to give up five runs or more in an ill-advised pitching escapade. Here are the other eight -- every darned one of them:
Manny Castillo, Mariners, 1983 -- 7 R, 2 1/3 IP
Larry Bittner, Cubs, 1977 -- 6 R, 1 1/3 IP
Derek Bell, Padres, 2000 -- 5 R, 1 IP
Rod Brewer, Cardinals, 1993 -- 5 R, 1 IP
Keith Osik, Pirates, 2000 -- 5 R, 1 IP
John Mabry, Mariners, 2001 -- 5 R, 1/3 IP
Larry Harlow, Orioles, 1978 -- 5 R, 2/3 IP
Manny Alexander, Orioles, 1996 -- 5 R, 2/3 IP
The Sultan's Corner
When the Indians began busting out in threes last month, it caused the Sultan of Swat Stats, SABR's David Vincent, to start pounding on his keyboard. And the classic home run notes started flying. First off, when Victor Martinez and Travis Hafner had three-homer games on the same road trip, it made the Indians just the fourth team in history to pull off that cool feat. The others:
May 21-22, 1930 -- Yankees: Babe Ruth vs. A's, Lou Gehrig vs. A's.
Sept. 10-15, 1950 -- Yankees: Joe DiMaggio vs. Tigers, Johnny Mize vs. Tigers.
June 24-July 1, 1956 -- Reds: Ed Bailey vs. Dodgers, Ted Kluszewski vs. Cardinals.
Sept. 25, 2001 -- Brewers: Jeromy Burnitz and Richie Sexson vs. Diamondbacks (same game).


Hafner, meanwhile, pulled off another exotic feat all by himself: He hit five home runs in 24 hours -- two in a night game July 19, three more the next afternoon. According to the Sultan, only five other men have ever homered five times in 24 hours (i.e., day game after night game, or a doubleheader):
Stan Musial May 2, 1954 (DH)
Joe Adcock July 30-31, 1954
Nate Colbert Aug. 1, 1972 (DH)
Dave Kingman July 27-28, 1979
Barry Bonds May 19-20, 2001
And on July 20, Hafner and Albert Pujols became the 12th players in history to have three-homer games on the same day. The others, courtesy of the Sultan:
July 4, 1939 -- Hank Leiber (Cubs), Jim Tabor (Red Sox)
Aug. 2, 1950 -- Larry Doby (Indians), Andy Pafko (Cubs)
June 6, 1965 -- Johnny Callison (Phillies), Tom Tresh (Yankees)
July 26, 1970 -- Johnny Bench (Reds), Orlando Cepeda (Braves)
Sept. 14, 1987 -- Mickey Brantley (Mariners), Ernie Whitt (Blue Jays)
Sept. 15, 1996 -- Benito Santiago (Phillies), Frank Thomas (White Sox)
Sept. 24, 1996 -- Mo Vaughn (Red Sox), Willie Greene (Reds)
April 25, 1997 -- Ken Griffey (Mariners), Matt Williams (Indians)
Sept. 25, 2001 -- Jeromy Burnitz (Brewers), Richie Sexson (Brewers)
Aug. 10, 2002 -- Sammy Sosa (Cubs), Mike Lieberthal (Phillies)
As long as we're on this three-homer-game roll, Kevin Millar's three-homer eruption against the Yankees on July 23 represented only the third time any player had ever hit three homers in a Yankees-Red Sox game. The other two:
June 23, 1927 - Lou Gehrig (Yankees)
May 30, 1997 - Mo Vaughn (Red Sox)
Maybe our favorite home run feat of July was Carlos Lee's two-homer game off his namesake, Cliff Lee. The Sultan reports that was only the fifth multihomer game in history involving a hitter and pitcher with the same last name. The others:
Aug. 29, 1986 -- Mike Davis off Storm Davis (2)
Sept. 2, 1916 -- Cy Williams off Steamboat Williams (2)
June 25, 1997 -- Chipper Jones off Bobby Jones (2)
Aug. 7, 2003 -- David Ortiz off Ramon Ortiz (2)
When Gary Sheffield hit his 400th home run last week, it meant there were nine active members of the 400-Homer Club. And it will be 10, if Fred McGriff gets another job this year. According to the Sultan, this is the first time in history that nine 400-homer men have been active at the same time. The previous record was eight -- twice:
2001 (8)
Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Rafael Palmeiro, Fred McGriff, Ken Griffey Jr., Jose Canseco, Cal Ripken.
2003 (8)
Bonds, Sosa, Palmeiro, McGriff, Griffey, Juan Gonzalez, Jeff Bagwell, Frank Thomas.
Before the 2000s came along, the old record was six (in both 1966 and '67) -- by a fabulous group:
Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Frank Robinson, Mickey Mantle, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews.
On another bizarre evening at Coors Field on Wednesday, the Cubs and Rockies combined to hit zero homers in the first six innings -- and then six in the last three innings. The Sultan reports this was only the fourth game in history where that many homers were hit in the last three innings after none were hit in the first six. The others:
July 18, 1942 -- White Sox at Yankees (6)
June 7, 1976 -- Reds at Pirates (7)
Aug. 26, 1998 -- Marlins at Cardinals (6)
Finally, two new ballparks opened this year (Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia and Petco Park in San Diego) -- and Phillies leadoff man Jimmy Rollins hit the first inside-the-park homers in BOTH of them (June 20 in Philadelphia, Wednesday in San Diego).
The Sultan reports he's just the second player in history to hit the first inside-the-parkers in the life of two different parks. The other: Fernando Vina (SBC Park in San Francisco on May 9, 2000 and Miller Park in Milwaukee on Oct. 2, 2001).

Is there a more famous ankle in America these days than Curt Schilling's?
If there is, we can't think of one. Adam Vinatieri's? Freddy Adu's? Natalie Portman's (just because it's connected to the rest of her)? Nope. Sorry.
The most famous ankle in America belongs to a guy who made two trips to the mound in October, with 55 stitches in that ankle, and held the terrifying lineups of the Yankees and Cardinals to a total of eight hits and one earned run in 13 innings.
Schilling was so good in those games, in fact, that he had several skeptics questioning whether his ankle was really in as rough shape as he said it was.
But ESPN.com was able to obtain two photos of the fabled ankle in question, taken on the day of Schilling's Game 2 World Series start. And let's just say you don't need a framed med-school degree to notice this ankle doesn't resemble yours or ours -- not unless you're sitting in an orthopedic waiting room as you're reading this, anyway.
If you look closely at the top photo accompanying this story, you can actually see the stitches, holding together what appears to be a basketball underneath his skin. However, reliable sources have confirmed that's really an ankle in there someplace.
It always amazes us what athletes will do at times to play in the biggest games of their lives. But the more we look at this photo, the more we understand that what Curt Schilling did last month is one of the most amazing sports stories of the 21st century.

CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Before we ask you today's blazing question, we'd better update you on a few things.
Let's see now. Carlos Beltran is in Queens. Sammy Sosa is an Oriole. Magglio Ordonez is a Tiger.
The major-league home run leader (Adrian Beltre) now works for the Mariners. And so does Richie Sexson.
Carlos Delgado swims with the Marlins. Moises Alou plays for his father in San Francisco. And the list of other mashers who can no longer be found where you saw them last includes Steve Finley (Angels), Troy Glaus (Diamondbacks), Jeff  Kent (Dodgers), J.D. Drew (Dodgers) and Edgar Renteria (Red Sox).
So now that this little game of Musical Bats is over, it's time to pull up your bar stool and debate a question that's way more fun than debating whether Jose Canseco can pass his pay-per-view lie-detector test. Here goes:
Which team has the best lineup in baseball?
Not the best defense. Not the best depth. Not the best cleanup man. Which team has the best collection of thumpers, top to bottom?
We'll give you a second to order another beverage and think about it.
Is it the Red Sox, the first team in half a century to lead its league in runs, batting average, on-base percentage and slugging in back-to-back seasons?
Is it the Yankees, a team that could easily get eight 20-homer regulars out of its modest little $200 million ball club?
Is it the Cardinals, a National League team with an AL-type middle of the order (Larry Walker, Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, Jim Edmonds)?
Is it the Orioles, a team that (surprise, surprise) led the major leagues in hits last year -- and has added Sammy Sosa?
Is it the Marlins, a club that signed Carlos Delgado and will have a 23-homer-hitting shortstop (Alex Gonzalez) hitting eighth?
Or is it someone else -- the Angels, Rangers, Indians, Phillies or maybe a team that just missed leading the league in on-base percentage last year, the San Bonds-isco Giants?
Hmmm. Not that easy, is it? In fact, it's not even a one-beverage kind of question. So in order to help you out, the next time you find yourself down at the old corner saloon with time to burn and nothing but hoops blowouts on the big screens, we asked four pitchers, three scouts and nine GMs or assistants the same question this week.
And just so we can get two debates out of this for the price of one, we're also dividing our discussion into two parts -- one for each league. After all, we have to make this a little more fair for the lineups that have to send sweet-swinging hurlers like Mark (2-for-75 lifetime) Redman to the plate. OK, ready for action? Here goes:
American League
NO. 1 -- RED SOX
Stunningly, they had a lot easier time beating the Yankees in this poll than they did in the ALCS. Of the 14 men who voted on the AL lineups, 13 picked the Red Sox as the best of the best. Hey, why not? They're already the fifth team in history to score at least 949 runs two years in a row. So just ahead are the 1930-31-32 Yankees and 1936-37-38-39 Yankees -- the only teams to do that at least three seasons in a row. And these Red Sox actually ought to be better offensively. They've added Edgar Renteria, who has averaged 40 doubles, 24 steals and 85 RBI a year over the last three seasons. So now every regular in this lineup has had at least a .370 on-base percentage in one, or both, of the last two seasons. Which is downright ridiculous.
THE REVIEWS: "The best, hands-down. They can all crush you, one through nine." ... "Their nine-hole hitter (Mark Bellhorn) had 57 extra-base hits." ... "They have such a relentless offense, it takes real mental toughness to get them out. It isn't the most talented [pitchers] who stop them. It's the toughest."
PITCHER'S REVIEW: "They're so tough at home. All their left-handed hitters have power the other way, so they can take you over the wall or off the wall. And they're all clutch guys -- every one of them."
NO. 2 -- YANKEES
Most of our panelists picked George's Bombers second to Boston, but not everyone is sold -- since they were also chosen as low as fifth. On one hand, seven of the nine regulars hit between 21 and 36 homers last year -- and an eighth (some guy named Giambi) used to hit 40 a year before You Know What. On the other hand, there are lots of age and health concerns -- especially at the bottom of the order. So about all that's safe to project from this group is that they'll make a ton of home-run trots. They've made at least 230 of them two seasons in a row -- and only the 2001-02-03 Rangers and 1996-97-98-99 Mariners have done that three straight years or more.
THE REVIEWS: "Still good. Just getting older and not likely to close the gap." ... "The big difference between this team and the Red Sox is the number of breathers in the lineup. The Yankees are easier to pitch to." ... "When Jeter, A-Rod, Sheffield and Matsui lock in, they can really grind at-bats and score runs in a hurry." ... "Needless to say, Mr. Giambi is the X-factor." ... "I don't like this group that much at all. I'm not sold on [Tony] Womack. Giambi, who knows? Bernie [Williams], the sun's setting. And Tino, I don't know what he's got left."
PITCHER'S REVIEW: "A lot like the Red Sox, with maybe a little more power."
NO. 3 -- ANGELS
They had exactly the same team batting average (.282) and on-base percentage (.341) last year as that Angels team that won the World Series in 2002 -- and hit more homers. So this lineup continues to be a handful. Only now the Angels have slightly retooled. They've subtracted Jose Guillen, David Eckstein and Troy Glaus -- but added Steve Finley, Orlando Cabrera and a rookie third baseman (Dallas McPherson) whose 43 homers and 186 minor-league strikeouts last year suggest he could evolve into anyone from Adam Dunn to Russell Branyan. One thing about this offense: It hasn't read "Moneyball." No team in the big leagues struck out less last year than the Angels -- but these guys also walked 200 fewer times than the Yankees or Red Sox.
THE REVIEWS: "More question marks than the Red Sox or Yankees, but you could make a case they could be better in the end, because of the gas in the middle of their lineup." ... "A little similar to Florida. They've got a lot of different types of guns to beat you -- speed, power and pretty good depth to the lineup if McPherson comes through."
PITCHER'S REVIEW: "Vladimir Guerrero is probably the best hitter I've ever seen in my life."
NO. 4 -- RANGERS
Only the Red Sox bashed more extra-base hits last year than this team. Only the Yankees and White Sox hit more homers. Only the Red Sox, Yankees and White Sox scored more runs. Now factor in the most hitter-friendly ballpark in the non-Coors Field portion of the continent, and it's clear that scoring runs will not be the Rangers' problem. And just for the record, this is not a recording. The only thing that makes this lineup tough to evaluate is trying to figure how much the ballpark inflates their numbers. If you're wondering, the answer last year was 30 points in batting average, 80 points in slugging percentage and a 35-percent assist in their home run rate. Most significant new face this year: Richard Hidalgo, who considers himself a clear winner in the contract-drive lottery.
THE REVIEWS: "A young lineup that should continue to improve, [but the] 7-9 holes aren't as strong as [Boston or New York]." ... "Superior collection of young hitters." ... "The guy at first base [Mark Teixera] is a monster. He should be a 40 home run guy for a lot of years. And look around: The second baseman [Alfonso Soriano], the shortstop [Michael Young], the third baseman [Hank Blalock], the left fielder [Kevin Mench], the right fielder [Hidalgo] and even the catcher [Rod Barajas] hit a lot of balls in the seats." ... "They need [Laynce] Nix to take the same step forward that Teixeira, Young and Mench have taken."
PITCHER'S REVIEW: "A lot of aggressive hitters who can hurt you. Probably the most aggressive team in the American League."
NO. 5 -- INDIANS
Talk about your deep lineups. This team had seven hitters with 70-plus RBI, eight with 70-plus runs scored and five with 50-plus extra-base hits. So no wonder they rocketed from 25th in baseball in runs to fifth. And that was with the youngest team in the league. If Jody Gerut makes it back from knee surgery and they succeed in reincarnating Juan Gonzalez and Aaron Boone, this No. 5 ranking might seem low by autumn.
THE REVIEWS: "Dark-horse offensive force, but the uncertainty of the right fielder [Gonzalez] can either drag it down or [surprise!] support it until Gerut returns." . . . "They just keep coming at you." ... "People don't talk about them, because they have so many young guys mixed in. But they've got a lot of bats in that lineup." ... "Deep and well-balanced.  Should be able to use their bench to get favorable matchups."
PITCHER'S REVIEW: "Nobody gives them any respect, but very scrappy."
NOT ENOUGH VOTES TO MAKE THE LIST: Orioles, Tigers, Athletics, Mariners.
Trivia answer
Astros (Jeff Bagwell, Lance Berkman, Richard Hidalgo) and Dodgers (Shawn Green, Adrian Beltre, Gary Sheffield).

When a team wins one of its first 14 road games and two of its first 22, our job here at ESPN is to look for reasons.
When a team goes nearly a month and a half without holding more than a one-run lead in any road game, our mission is to look for trends. Or tendencies.
Or even curses.
Which brings us to the mysterious case of the 2005 Houston Astros.
Our ESPN investigators have finally uncovered the real reason these Astros have had so much trouble finding the bright side of the road. It's all because of 
The Curse of Jim Deshaies.
"Yep," Deshaies admitted when we confronted him recently with the harsh truth. "It's me, the Bambino and a goat."
In case you're not familiar with our pal Deshaies, he appears, on the surface, to be your basic mild-mannered, quick-witted, always-incisive Astros broadcaster.
But if you delve beneath that theoretically innocent veneer, you will find he has a job description that would raise anyone's eyebrow during a season like this:
He only broadcasts this team's road games.
OK, any more questions?
Amazingly, not many folks, either inside or outside the Astros' little universe, have caught on to this seemingly inescapable connection.
"But I imagine," Deshaies chuckled, "that when you get done with this article, that's going to change, huh?"
Well, probably. But we can't help that. Just doing our job here, folks.
One man who has noticed, though, is Larry Dierker. Yes, he's the Astros' former manager. But that's not all he is. He's also the guy who, essentially, platoons with Deshaies on the Astros' broadcast team.
Dierker's gig: Home games. Deshaies' gig: Road games.
So, not surprisingly, the team's record when each broadcaster is in the booth looks slightly different. Dierker (through Thursday): four games over .500 (16-12). Deshaies: 16 games under .500 (7-23).
Which explains why, before one recent home game  when that road-record topic came up  Dierker couldn't help himself.
"You know," he said, "maybe the problem is Deshaies. I'm doing pretty good."
Whereupon the Astros went out and (what else?) lost. Which meant, Deshaies reported, that "Dierk had to immediately apologize to the gods of baseball."
But where are those gods of baseball when Deshaies needs them, huh? This poor guy went three and a half weeks at one point (April 15-May 9) without broadcasting a single Astros win. Which isn't easy.
Still, he never envisioned himself as being worthy of having his own curse named after him  until we so helpfully brought him face to face with that reality.
"I haven't really bought into that whole thing about curses," he said. "But if this thing takes hold, I might have to become a little more proactive about exonerating myself."
Well, let's look back into Deshaies' past and search for previous curse indicators.
In his 12 years pitching in the big leagues  seven with the Astros  he once set a strikeout record even Nolan Ryan never set: On Sept. 23, 1986, Deshaies became the only pitcher since 1900 to strike out the first eight hitters of a game  a streak so electrifying that manager Tommy Lasorda pinch hit for his pitcher in the third inning to stop it.
So that wasn't very curse-like.
OK, so Deshaies did finish his career with six straight sub-.500 seasons, including one (6-12, 7.39 ERA in 1994) in which he described himself as "the poster boy for bad pitching." But we can think of a thousand pitchers who had a worse career than Deshaies. So he sure didn't pitch his way into this curse.
And he certainly hasn't shown any prior curse tendencies as a broadcaster, either. Last year's Astros even went 44-37 on the road. They also made it to the playoffs in five of his first eight seasons behind the mike. So that can't be it.
And one thing that's been firmly established is no one has ever found any resemblance between Deshaies and Mr. George H. "Babe" Ruth  although, Deshaies confessed, "I did used to do a killer Bambino home-run trot in college."
But "on the all-time home run list," Deshaies calculated, "he's ahead of me, 714-0  plus four in Little League."
In fact, Deshaies is just about the official anti-Bambino offensively. The Babe holds the all-time record for most extra-base hits in a season (119 in 1921). Deshaies, on the other hand, holds the all-time record for most career at-bats (373) without getting any extra-base hits.
So it's safe to say that if Deshaies has caught the curse bug, he didn't get it from the fabled Bambino.
As for that goat, Deshaies said he's not a big eater or drinker of any goat products  even though he admitted, "We stop occasionally for some goat-cheese fudge in Haines City, Fla., during spring training." But that wouldn't seem to do it.
"I have been to the Billy Goat Tavern [in Chicago]," Deshaies acknowledged. "Maybe that's where I caught it. So I have been exposed to the curse germ, I guess. But it's very limited exposure."
At this point, though, the goal is no longer to find where the curse came from. It's to figure out what to do about it. And that's no simple challenge, either.
In New England, they once tried digging up the Bambino's piano from the bottom of a pond. But the only Deshaies broadcasting memorabilia we could unearth would be an old scorebook. And "you'd have to go through the recycling center in Houston to find that, I guess," he said. Not a real enticing thought.
Back in his playing career, Deshaies recalled, the Astros once lost 11 in a row in San Diego. So one day, while browsing through a bookstore, he came upon a book on witchcraft that he thought might help snap that Curse of Jack Murphy Stadium.
"I remember there were some specific twigs we had to gather," he said, "although we might not have gathered those exact twigs. Then we had to separate the twigs, light them on fire and say, 'The burner has burned. The turner has turned. Let everything but good come from this wood.'
"We did that, and we won. So that would be the last time I was actually in the curse-breaking business."
But he keeps forgetting to pack his twigs these days. So either he'll have to come up with a new incantation, he said, "or go watch 'Bewitched' this summer."
Then again, this would seem to be a trickier curse to bust than that one, mainly because Deshaies said he's not sure whether "I'm breaking a curse on myself or breaking a curse on the team. And if it's just the road, I mean, the road is kind of a vague notion. Isn't it?"
He figures he could always burn just the road portion of his pocket schedule, but that would involve some intricate scissor artisanship.
Or there's one particularly radical strategy he could try: Switching roles with Dierker  and just working home games for a while.
"Have I thought about that? Absolutely," Deshaies said. "But there's a fear there. If people started to really believe this, and then Dierk went on the road and they started to win, I'd be dead meat.
"Then," Deshaies said, a tinge of sadness in his normally chipper voice, "I legitimately would be a curse. And that's a risk I'm not willing to take."
So we'll leave this up to you to decide. Maybe he's not a curse, and this is just coincidence (the Astros have, after all, won five of their last seven on the road).
Or maybe there's no such thing as curses. Which would even get that goat off the hook.
It's all your call. Here at ESPN, after all, we're not in the business of accusing, convicting or re-enacting those Salem witchcraft trials. We just lay out the facts. Make of them what you will.
Convincing as these particular facts may be, we want you to feel free to let this great human off the hook. He deserves that.
We just have one question: Why was he last seen gathering all those twigs?

These 2005 Minnesota Twins apparently aren't Luke Skywalker's kind of team. Or B.B. King's kind of team.
They'd never be caught reading "Ball Four." And they'll never take a stroll down anyone's Walk of Fame.
In a sport where way too many pitchers can't tell the strike zone from a time zone, these 2005 Twins have turned into an entire pitching staff of control freaks.
Any time you find yourself comparing a team to the 1876 Hartford Dark Blues and the 1906 White Sox, you know you're talking about a team that is, officially, from a whole 'nother era.
But that's where these Twins find themselves these days, throwing strikes at a rate that's unheard of in the 21st Century. Here are just some of their highlights so far:
Through Thursday, nearly 600 innings into their season, this staff was issuing a ridiculous 1.74 walks per nine innings. That would be the lowest walk rate in a full season, since Red Lucas' 1933 Reds (1.71)  and the lowest by an American League team since the Doc White's 1906 White Sox (1.67).
In a sport in which one starting pitcher since 1919 (Bret Saberhagen) has made it through a 150-inning season with more wins than walks, this team went into Friday with two starters with more wins than walks  Brad Radke (five wins, four walks) and Carlos Silva (five wins, four walks). If you're wondering, the only team in history that had two starters with more wins than walks was those aforementioned 1876 Dark Blues  whose two starters (Tommy Bond and Candy Cummings) were also the only two pitchers on the entire staff.
Think about this: Through Thursday, Radke and Silva had walked four hitters apiece all season. Eight different pitchers this year have walked four just in one inning  and one (Phillies rookie Gavin Floyd) has done that twice.
With 387 strikeouts and only 113 walks, the Twins are on pace for the greatest strikeout-walk ratio (3.42 K per BB) of any team since 1900. No AL staff in history has ever even finished a season with three times as many whiffs as walks. (Current record-holders: the 2003 Yankees, at 2.98.)
Speaking of strikeout-walk ratios, this team's ace  the great Johan Santana  has 121 strikeouts this season and only 13 walks (9.31 K/BB). That would break Pedro Martinez's AL strikeout-to-walk record (8.88 in 2000). And it would approach Curt Schilling's major-league record (9.58 in 2002) for a non-strike season. Only one problem: Radke's ratio (60 strikeouts, four walks, 15.0 K/BB) would break both of those records by an even bigger margin.
Finally, Twins pitchers rank first (Radke), second (Silva) and fourth (Santana) in the AL in fewest walks per nine innings. And in a full season, no staff has placed three pitchers in the top four in that department since the 1942 Yankees (Tiny Bonham first, Red Ruffing third, Marv Breuer fourth).
So what's their secret? Well, there's no truth to the rumor they fine pitchers for every walk.
"Hell," laughed manager Ron Gardenhire, "we wouldn't get very rich that way."
Well, if it's revenue streams they're after, maybe they ought to release their own video: "How to Find the Strike Zone Without Asking MapQuest for Directions." Or something like that.
"Yeah, we could, I guess," said pitching coach Rick Anderson. "But it would probably be the most boring video ever seen."
OK, so it might be true that strike-throwing isn't quite as spine-tingling as the Home Run Derby. But it sure does work. The Twins are on pace to allow just 648 runs, which would be the team's fewest in any full season since 1970.
So what's their secret? It's a rare combination of basic philosophy and some unique individuals. Let's take a look at each.
Strike One
The Twins sure didn't invent the concept of throwing strike one. In fact, they don't even make a big deal of it.
"We just say, 'Make one of the first two pitches a strike,'" Anderson said, "because if they throw ball one, we don't want them thinking, 'Uh-oh. Now I'm already in trouble.'"
But no team in the big leagues throws strike one more relentlessly than this team. The Twins have thrown first-pitch strikes to 66 percent of the hitters they've faced this year, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, the best rate in baseball. The average team is at 58.5 percent.
"I have to admit," Anderson said, "that there have been some games where I'd get the game chart at the end of the game and look at the first-pitch strikes, and even I'm amazed. You'll see Radke: 28 of 31. Then the next night, you'll see Silva: 25 of 30. These guys are amazing."
According to Elias, Radke leads all qualifying big-league starters in first-pitch strike percentage, with a mind-boggling 77.1 percent. And Santana (68.7) and Silva (67.3) both throw strike one more than twice as often as ball one. Again, the average is only 58.5 percent.
"The magic number used to be 60 percent first-pitch strikes," Anderson said. "But we've gone up. Now we say 65 percent  and we've gotten there. For us, it's been pretty successful."
Root for Web Gems
In an era where many pitchers fear contact, the Twins are one team that's actually in favor of contact.
If you've watched many Web Gem highlight reels on Baseball Tonight, you may have noticed those Twins defenders tend to show up there now and then. So if you're pitching in front of guys who catch the ball the way this team catches it, why wouldn't you be in favor of letting them do that as much as possible?
"That," Gardenhire said, "is something we've really preached: Throw the ball over, and let the boys catch it. We think we've got one of the best outfields in the game in tracking and catching the baseball. And even though we've changed quite a bit in our infield, we still have guys who believe in catching the ball."
So it's no accident the Twins throw more strikes, in general, (66.9 percent) than any team in baseball. And because they catch so many of those balls put in play, they also throw fewer pitches per game (131.6) than any team in baseball.
"If you talk to our players, they'll all tell you that one thing we've always talked about is: 'The longer we're out there in the field, the more chance we have of making mistakes,'" Gardenhire said. "So we're always talking about, 'Get the boys off the field,' because everyone knows that when you're hitting, you can't give up any runs."
But using your good friends with the gloves isn't a concept the Twins started working on only when Torii Hunter showed up. This one actually goes back nearly two decades, to the arrival of Tom Kelly as manager.
"If you come out early in spring training," Gardenhire said, "you'll see our pitchers standing behind the screen, watching our fielders do their drills. We call it our "Good Morning America" drill. That was something T.K. [Kelly] brought in here. He used to tell [longtime pitching coach] Dick Such, 'Get those pitchers out there  and let them know how hard these guys are working to catch the ball for them.'"
Keep on throwing
Then there is one Twins ritual that Anderson openly admits to borrowing from Leo Mazzone and the Braves: Throw, throw and throw some more.
Every day, just about every Twins pitcher treks to the bullpen before games and does at least some light throwing  often in sneakers, not spikes.
"We do a lot of it in tennis shoes," Anderson said. "That way, if you overdo it, you'll slip and slide and fall on your butt. We don't want them overdoing it. We just like to see our guys touch the mound and touch the baseball as much as possible."
This isn't about guys trying to break the radar guns. This is more like baseball's version of shooting free throws in practice.
If touch and rhythm and muscle memory can help Steve Nash make foul shots, why can't they help Brad Radke throw strikes? After all, sometimes the best concepts are also the least complicated.
Major in psych
Does strike-throwing feed off itself? It sure seems to, because when a team is this good at anything, it tends to get in not just the pitchers' heads, but the hitters' heads.
"Everybody on that team is all over the zone, man," said Rangers shortstop Michael Young. "They don't walk anybody."
So think about how that knowledge plays on the minds of hitters walking to the plate against these Twins pitchers. Working the count is normally a great plan, but not against these guys.
"You know they're throwing strike one," Young said. "So the thing you have to remind yourself is to keep your normal approach, because it's really tempting to change.  You want to be aggressive against them. But at the same time, you don't want to force your hand. Then you get behind, and you've fallen right into their hands."
That, of course, is what the Twins want those hitters to do  get behind and fall into their hands. And there's more and more evidence that many hitters are beginning to psych themselves out against this staff.
Even the Twins have noticed that, as word of their strike-throwing exploits spreads, more offenses are hacking as if they're increasingly aware of that trend.
"We've had a few guys on the other teams talk to our guys in the last few weeks, talking about the walks," Anderson said. "You can see teams are coming up with contact in mind. They're thinking: 'Swing early, because you know they're going to throw it over.'"
But is that really the way to hit against this group? The Twins say: Bring it on.
"It should actually help us," Anderson said. "Santana has three pitches he can throw for strikes. So swing away. Pick one. Radke throws three pitches for strikes. [Joe] Mays and Silva both throw those hard sinkers. So if you want to swing away on them, it plays right into their hands.
"And they all know that if it's 3-and-2, they're swinging, because they know it's not going to be ball four. So if those guys throw a sinker, or Radke throws a slider, or Santana throws a changeup, and it's just off the plate, it probably gets hacked at."
Professor Radke
When Radke walks a hitter, you practically expect everyone in the Twins' dugout to pass out.
"He walked a guy in L.A. the other day," Anderson quipped. "And I was ready to go to the mound and say, 'What are you doing?'"
It's hard to believe there could be a pitcher on this planet averages nearly 100 batters between walks (388 hitters faced, four walks). But Radke is. That, however, is only because he's practically in a strike-throwing slump these days.
This man started out the season by walking one of the first 247 hitters who stepped into the box. Read that stat a few times and digest it.
"Radke's always laughing about this," Anderson said. "He says, 'I've got such crappy stuff, I'd better get ahead.'"
Well, he's sure done that. He leads all active starters in lowest career walk ratio (1.63 per nine IP). He has walked one hitter or none in all 14 starts this year. He has gone 78 straight starts without walking more than three. And he has thrown a higher percentage of strikes (73.3) than any qualifying starter in baseball this year.
"He's the guy who sets the example for everyone else," Anderson said. "I mean, Silva just worships Radke. He calls him the Professor. Silva actually comes out and watches him throw his bullpens. Then he'll come away and say, 'The Professor is good.' They all watch him. They watch how he attacks the strike zone. If Radke can do that, throwing 88-90, a guy like Silva, who throws 91-93, says, 'Why can't I do that?'"
Carlos Silva
There was a time when people wondered whether a guy who induces as little swinging and missing as Carlos Silva could ever be a consistently reliable starting pitcher.
Even though Silva's career strikeout rate (3.74 per nine IP) is the lowest of any active pitcher with as many innings as he's pitched, the secret to his success is that he has cut his walk rate three straight years  from 3.81 per nine IP two years ago, to 1.55 last year, to a microscopic 0.45 this season.
"He's a guy who has really surprised me with how few guys he's walked, just because of who he is," Anderson said. "It just stands to reason that you make a lot more mistakes with a sinker down than with a straight fastball.  But his ball moves so much that even if he throws that sinker in the middle of the plate, they still pound it into the ground."
Johan Santana
We've seen very few power pitchers in our lifetime like Santana.
It's one thing to strike out almost 11 hitters per nine innings (as Santana is doing this year). It's another thing to do it while throwing so many strikes that the hitters are almost afraid not to swing.
"Most strikeout pitchers wind up throwing a lot of pitches and walking guys," Anderson said. "But this guy is absolutely the ultimate example of a guy trusting his stuff.  He has three pitches he can throw for strikes at any time. He trusts his stuff. And he just pounds the strike zone with it."
Only Radke has thrown a higher percentage of strikes than Santana (70.3 percent). And Santana is so efficient that, incredibly, 95 starting pitchers are averaging more pitches per inning this year than he is (14.3), even though none of them have a higher strikeout rate than he does. Which is almost impossible.
So friends, this is how a team makes strike-tossing history. Feed off each other. Let the glove men do their thing. And watch the hitters try to figure out how to deal with it all.
In fact, there's only one Twin who doesn't seem to be cooperating. And that, we regret to report, is the manager  who is only two behind the league leader in most intentional walks issued.
"Hey, let me tell you," Gardenhire chuckled. "It's getting really hard to put up those four fingers, because I look down the dugout and all the pitchers are shaking their heads: 'No way.'"

HOW LONG IT'S STOOD:
65 years (1941)
CLOSEST CALL SINCE:
44 games, by Pete Rose in 1978
This is it -- the record that has it all. Held by one of the most worshipped players of all time. (Sheez, we were accused by an e-mailer of trying to "bring down" DiMaggio just because we merely dared to cover Jimmy Rollins' streak.) And so time-tested that only one guy (Rose) has gotten within two weeks of breaking it. Yet it still doesn't feel untouchable.
It's also 100 percent controversy-free (even though esteemed historian Pete Palmer says, correctly, that hitting streaks in general are "highly overrated"). And for sheer buzz factor, it's off the charts, because "it's something that builds, day after day after day," says ESPN's own streakmeister, Orel Hershiser. "Look at Jimmy Rollins and what he just went through. That daily buzz is pretty cool."
In a poll in which just about nobody agreed on anything, this was a runaway winner. So it's official. This is now the standard by which all records should be judged.

You think it's hard to hit 755 home runs? Let's talk about a feat that's just as hard:
Hitting one home run.
And only one.
In 3,379 at-bats.
Now you may think we're only tossing a crazy statement like that out there as some cheap stunt to get your attention. But this is one cheap stunt we can back up with actual facts.
And the actual facts tell us there are more members in the 750 Homer Club (two) than there are in the One Homer In 3,000 At-Bats Club (one). Feel free to look that up.
So as we interrupt pretty much all our regularly scheduled programming these days to commemorate a man who is about to hit more home runs than anyone else who ever played major league baseball, shouldn't we be fair? And just? And balanced?
Shouldn't we devote at least one small sector of cyberspace to the man who has made history in the most diametrically opposite way possible?
Well, of course, we should. So here's to the King of Not Hitting Homers. Here's to Duane Eugene Kuiper -- for 12 seasons a sure-handed, not-so-power-packed big league second baseman, and now, (irony of ironies) for the last 14 seasons, a terrific broadcaster for those San Francisco (Home of Barry) Giants.
In a few weeks, we can celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Home Run That Made Duane Kuiper Famous. So mark your calendars. It happened on Aug. 29, 1977. Who among us will ever forget it?
OK, so the answer to that is: just about everybody. But not Kuiper himself, naturally. He has retold this tale a whole lot more than 755 times since then. That's for darned sure.
He was playing second base for the Indians back then, in only his third full season in the big leagues. He stepped in to hit against White Sox pitcher Steve Stone in the first inning of a game at old Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Only 6,236 witnesses were on hand. We're sure millions more wish they were.
"I remember I hit it, and I saw Wayne Nordhagen, the right fielder, running after it, and I saw his number," Kuiper reminisced. "And I never saw a right fielder's number. I saw him running back, and I said, 'You know what? This is going to go out.'"
That's a thought that didn't exactly race through Kuiper's brain every time he swung the bat, you understand. So pay attention -- because, in fact, this ball did go out. Way out. Deep into the third row. Or possibly the fourth.
But the precise location isn't important now. What's important is that the historic baseball clattered off (what else?) an empty seat and caromed back onto the field.
So Nordhagen, astutely recognizing that this was a guy who was capable of playing eight more seasons without ever hitting another home run, picked up the ball and fired it toward the Cleveland dugout. Which means Kuiper got to save the baseball.
But that's not all he saved.
As he was leaving the dugout to head for the plate a second time that night, his teammate, Bill Melton, said to him: "You're not going to use that bat again, are you?"
"So I said, 'Yeah, why not?'" Kuiper recalled. "He said, 'You may not hit another one. You ought to put that one away.' Well, I didn't know he was telling the truth. But I tried to bunt for a hit my next time up, and then I did put my bat away. Never used it again."
Instead, he gave the bat and the ball to the equipment manager, who had them mounted together, with a plaque that read: "Duane Kuiper's first major league home run." A few years later, a clairvoyant teammate grabbed a marker and added the fateful words, "and only," on there. But that's not important, either.
What's important is that Kuiper has the ball and the bat. You'd think he'd have sent them off to Cooperstown years ago. But mysteriously, Cooperstown has never asked. So Kuiper knows just where to look anytime he wants to savor his magic moment.
"Yeah, in the attic," he laughed. "It's mounted in the attic. It would probably take me 10 minutes to get to it, but I have a general idea where it's at."
Meanwhile, we still have the general idea that you, our loyal audience, don't yet comprehend the cosmic significance of the home run that plaque has preserved. So let's pause for a brief history lesson.
In the 62 seasons since World War II, no other members of the One Homer in Their Whole Darned Career Club have come within 1,000 at-bats of Kuiper's lifetime total. And just two one-homer men made it to 2,000 career at-bats: Woody Woodward (1 in 2,187 at-bats) and Al Newman (1 in 2,107).
In that same time span, every other player who batted as many times as Kuiper managed to hit at least five home runs -- with the exception of longtime ping-hitter Frank Taveras (who hit two).
And even if we take in all of baseball's eras -- live-ball, dead-ball, gloves-without-fingers, mound-45-feet-from-home-plate, etc. -- you'd still have to go back to 1886 (to the retirement of the mysterious Davy Force) to find another player who hit just one homer and came within 450 at-bats of getting as many shots to hit one as Kuiper did.
So there. Impressed yet?
No wonder Kuiper hung on to the bat and the ball -- and the seat, too, for that matter. The Indians gave him the seat after they traded him to the Giants in 1982. And where can you find that historic seat now? In his garage, where it has been residing since he hauled it in from his yard because the paint started cracking.
"I like to say that I hit it so hard, the ball cracked the top of the seat," Kuiper quipped. "But it doesn't look like that happened."
At the time that home run hit that seat, it was too early in Kuiper's career for him, or anyone, to have the proper perspective on what that mighty blast represented. That home run left the yard in 1977. But Kuiper didn't leave the playing field himself until 1985. So he racked up another 1,997 at-bats in his day, every one of them 100 percent trot-free.
In all that time, he said, there were barely even any close calls. But there was one near-miss he'll never forget -- a triple off the top of the fence in 1981. And the reason Kuiper will never forget it is because the pitcher who gave it up happened to be the same guy who served up The Homer -- Steve Stone.
"I remember standing on third, looking at Stoney's face, and I realized that [having the second ball not go out] was a good thing," Kuiper said, at his sympathetic best. "To have two in your whole life -- and have them both off the same guy -- that would have been rough. Plus, Stoney was born in Cleveland. His parents lived there. He did not need to hear all that crap."
Nope, sure didn't. So instead, all the crap was reserved for Kuiper himself. As the seasons and at-bats mounted -- but the homer total didn't mount -- he heard it all from America's most compassionate fans, folks who obviously didn't sufficiently appreciate the art of not homering.
But Kuiper appreciated it. And that's what mattered. He knew exactly what he was and exactly what he wasn't. And while Hank Aaron reincarnate was what he wasn't, he never did see any problem with that.


-- Duane Kuiper

"You know, when I got to the big leagues, [my manager] Frank Robinson pulled me aside," Kuiper said. "And he said, 'I'll give you 10 at-bats. If you hit more than two balls in the air, I'll send you back to Triple-A.' I kind of laughed. And he said, 'This is not a joke. I will send your ass back to Triple-A,' -- because I could run, and his whole idea was: hit the ball in the hole and make the shortstop throw you out. And that was the stroke that kept me in the big leagues.
"Of course," Kuiper couldn't help but add, "I kind of had that stroke anyway."
Did he think about what he might do or say if he ever hit another homer? Sure he did. But does it bug him, even a little bit, that he never hit another homer? Not for one second.
"There's something special about one," Kuiper philosophized. "There's not a whole lot special about two. I mean, nobody ever keeps their second major league hit."
So this is our chance to recognize that Kuiper's special in his way, just as Barry Bonds' little rendezvous with history is special in a whole different way. But there's something totally cool about the way the earth has spun, in its own crazy path, to bring them together around this momentous baseball event.
What, after all, are the odds that baseball's all-time Home Run King would have the biggest homer of his life called by a play-by-play man whose specialty was not hitting homers? A billion to one? A trillion? A zillion?
"You know what?" Kuiper said. "I keep saying that, at the end of Barry's career, I want a picture of just him and me. And whatever his total is, let's say it's 765, that will be my Christmas card.
"It's going to say: 'Combined, we've hit 766 together.'"
And that, too, will be an actual fact. Feel free to look it up -- and take a moment to salute the fact that the singles hitter's total was just as unique as that other guy's.

There's nothing better than epic, must-see postseason baseball.
Too bad we didn't witness a whole lot of that this October.
We would love to believe that this disappointing Octoberfest was one of those things, just some freak occurrence we could file under "Stuff Happens." But we're not so sure of that.
The more we look at the evidence, the more it's beginning to appear as if baseball may have inflicted this curse on itself -- by treating its postseason as if it were just another fall reality show. Is it "Pitching With the Stars" or "America's Next Top Rich Guy"?
We're now into Year 13 of the stretched-out, three-tiered postseason. But this year, thanks to accommodations to chasing ratings and Fox's prime-time needs, baseball went to new lengths to wriggle its October showcase into super-stretch mode.
So how's that working out? Is "disaster" too strong a word? And the problems started long before this October gave us the special magic that only five sweeps out of seven total series can produce. Let's take a look.
•  Now contrast that to the olden days of division play, when the postseason lasted only two rounds. In the 25 years under that format, 64 percent of all World Series (16 of 25) lasted at least six games. And 40 percent (10 of 25) went seven.
• Meanwhile, we've already had more World Series sweeps (five) in 13 years of three-tiered Octobers than we had in 25 years of two-tiered Octobers (three).
Again, is that an accident? We don't think so. In fact, we could make a case that it's a direct result of all the sitting around teams are now forced to do in October. Here's the evidence:
• But in the 13 postseasons since the expansion to three rounds, we've already had seven years in which at least one team had to wait around for five days or more for the World Series to begin.
So how are we supposed to believe that the decline of the Fall "Classic" is a totally unrelated development? There may not be a 100 percent cause and effect. But there's a connection. You'll never persuade us otherwise.
Nevertheless, the commish, Bud Selig, tried to pull off that very persuasion.
"It's an interesting theory," the commish said. "But I'm not sure I agree with it."
Selig said he saw "no inherent advantage" for either league that's built into the current system. And he said the players and ex-players he has asked about the time-off factor in the World Series "looked at me like I was crazy."
But if that's what he's thinking and that's what he's hearing, he definitely isn't talking to the same people we're talking to.
"Baseball is a game you play every day," one baseball official said. "And with all these [October] off days, that's not happening."
Exactly. But that's an administrator talking. Ask players who have lived through this postseason marathon, and they're even more effusive.
"Of course, it makes a difference," said Todd Jones, a member of the 2006 Tigers team that had six days off before it lurched into its World Series nightmare. "You can't hit a baseball after you've been sitting for eight days without seeing 98 miles an hour. The proof was Josh Beckett in Game 1 [of this World Series]. Didn't he throw just about all fastballs the first three or four innings?


--commissioner Bud Selig

"And no way should a pitcher have to be coming into Game 1 of a World Series just to get some work in. But that's what I did last year. And that's what the Rockies did this year."
We saw those developments in this World Series with our own eyes. So we know it's an issue. But the question is: Can any of this be repaired?
Unfortunately, this is one yolk baseball will never be able to stuff back inside the egg. But there are tweaks that could help. So we ran some of them past MLB's scheduling guru, Katy Feeney.
GO BACK TO THE OLD POSTSEASON SCHEDULE: The folks at Fox wanted the World Series to start in the middle of the week this year. So guess when baseball agreed to start it? No shock there. But did they have to spread the postseason out over 4½ frigging weeks to pull that off? Of course not. But they did it anyway. Wouldn't want to get in the way of the season premiere of "Prison Break" or anything. So what are the odds that the crummy ratings for this postseason could lead to a rollback to the old schedule? Uh, zero, unfortunately. Next October's format hasn't been finalized yet. But both Selig and Feeney say it will almost certainly mirror this October. Hey, great.
END THE SEASON MIDWEEK INSTEAD OF ON A SUNDAY: Here's a logical thought (we hope). Just because the World Series has to start on a Tuesday or a Wednesday doesn't mean the postseason has to last nearly a week longer than it used to. Couldn't you eliminate excessive October off days by just ending the season a couple of days later? "You could," Feeney said. "And that would put you on the same postseason schedule you had in the past. But if you end [the season] in midweek, that creates other issues." Uh-oh. And by that she means, of course, television. If the season ends midweek, that would probably mean also starting the season in the middle of a week. And that causes a problem with ESPN's contract, which includes the right to televise a Sunday night opener. We're not authorized to resolve problems like that. But there ought to be a solution in there someplace, wouldn't you think?
DUMP THE EXTRA OFF DAY DURING THE LCS: Is there any rational reason to schedule an extraneous day off between Games 4 and 5 of the LCS, when nobody is traveling -- other than the fact that it keeps baseball from interrupting the integral flow of "Kitchen Nightmares"? Heck, of course not. So please, can we zap that off day from next October's schedule? All the extra off day accomplished this year was to further lengthen the time the Rockies had to kill between series. They were done sweeping Arizona on Monday, Oct. 15. At that point, the Red Sox had played three games of the ALCS. So there were still six days left in the AL series, and the other series was already over. There will always be complications when there's a sweep in one league and a seven-gamer in the other. But every needless day of nothingness is one too many.






START THE WORLD SERIES ON A TUESDAY, NOT A WEDNESDAY: From what we've heard, it was Fox's decision to begin the World Series on Wednesday, even though its contract allowed the Series to start on Tuesday. Again, we're sure Fox had its reasons (by which we mean: "House"). But they weren't reasons that did baseball any favors. That timing meant one more day of thumb-twiddling by the Rockies. But it also meant that baseball scheduled itself to go head-to-head with both "Sunday Night Football" and "Monday Night Football." It could have at least dodged Monday's shoulder pads with a Tuesday-Wednesday-Friday-Saturday-Sunday format. So baseball needs to insist on a Tuesday start next year. Doesn't it?
The trouble with the ideas we've laid out, though, is this: They don't solve anything. They could eliminate some of that October downtime. They would snip a day here and a day there off the endless march through October. They could help the sport return to the days when the momentum and plot lines built, instead of fizzled, heading into the World Series.
But would they fix the issues that are diluting one of the greatest events in sports? Not really. And the commissioner is in full agreement with us on that.
"Do I worry about the competitive nature of the World Series? Of course I do," Selig said. "But I think there are a myriad of factors. And many of those factors we can't do anything about."
Yeah, he sure isn't going to eliminate the Division Series. We know that. But that extra layer of playoffs is taking its toll on baseball's signature event. And how ironic is that?
It turns out that the wild card -- one of Bud Selig's proudest achievements -- has been one of the best things ever to happen to the regular season because of the drama it produces in late September. But we're only now discovering that it's one of the worst things ever to happen to the postseason.
• Now that A-Rod has positioned himself as the poster boy for greed, what America needs is a free agent to latch on to as the anti-A-Rod. So here's our nominee: Todd Jones, a guy who is demanding a one-year contract, even though he has saved more games (115) in the past three years than Mariano Rivera, Billy Wagner or Francisco Cordero.

Jones

"My agent probably wants to kill me for saying this," Jones told Rumblings. "But I couldn't look an organization in the eye and sign a deal I'm not sure I can finish." Jones turns 40 next April, and you wouldn't exactly describe him as a fireballer anymore. Nevertheless, if Mike Stanton could get a two-year deal last winter at age 39, why couldn't Jones get two years (or more) this winter? "I couldn't do that," he said. "I really think players need to think about that more. Chivalry is good." Yep. And rare.
• The most popular Yankees trade rumor of the week -- Johnny Damon for Joe Crede -- looks like complete bunk. According to teams that have spoken with the Yankees, they wouldn't make a deal like that for several reasons: (1) uncertainty about the health of Crede's back, (2) Crede is a year away from free agency, and (3) he's represented by Scott Boras, who (shockingly) doesn't appear to be their favorite agent these days.
• Did the Astros get enough for Brad Lidge? Early returns from baseball men we've surveyed were all on the same wavelength: NO.
"I don't know why they did it so early in the game," one AL executive said. "They could have waited to see who lost out on [Francisco] Cordero. And once Mo [Rivera] goes back to the Yankees, that takes him out of the equation. So I'm not sure why they'd have done this now, without hitting a home run."

Bourn

Center fielder Michael Bourn has off-the-charts speed. But the rest of his game is so limited, said one scouting director, that as an everyday player, "I think you'll always be looking for a little more."
Third-base prospect Mike Costanzo has "easy power, but he'll need to get better as a hitter to get to it," said the same scouting director. "And he's not a real good third baseman. For me, he'd probably have to move to first."
And the scouting report on reliever Geoff Geary is he's "just another middle reliever."
The best you can say for the Astros' end of this deal is that, if Bourn and Costanzo realize their potential, the Astros would get to hang on to them for a combined 11 years, compared to one year before Lidge hit free agency.
But this basically boils down to "quantity for quality," the AL executive said. "They get three pieces -- none of them significant -- for a guy with the potential to be a quality closer."
• Meanwhile, this also might seem to be a puzzling deal from the Phillies' end, at least from this standpoint: They just traded away a center fielder, in Bourn, at a time when they're almost certainly going to lose their starting center fielder, Aaron Rowand, via the free-agent express.
But we'd been hearing from multiple clubs that the Phillies have been aggressively talking about deals involving both Bourn and Shane Victorino for the past few weeks. So they were already trying to add an outfielder, either in center or in right field, to create enough depth to make one of those deals.

Crisp

They've kicked the tires on both free agents (Geoff Jenkins?) and trade options (Coco Crisp?). And this trade tells us that they were so confident they could plug their outfield holes, they had no second thoughts about flipping the switch on this deal right out of the chute. In fact, the Phillies are mostly grateful they could trade for a pitcher as good as Lidge without having to give up Victorino, who now projects as their Opening Day center fielder.
• Incidentally, the Phillies have just about given up on the idea of trading Pat Burrell, who continues to give them no indication he'd waive his no-trade clause to go anywhere.
• More and more, we hear officials of other clubs saying the Red Sox have replaced the Yankees as the model for how large-dollar teams ought to operate. But not only off the field. On the field. "Unlike the Yankees, even when they had their great teams, the big thing with the Red Sox is, they let their emotions come out," one NL executive said. "They have fun. They're loose. The manager lets them play. And it works."
• When Andy MacPhail agreed to take a job with the Orioles, very few people envisioned he would wind up as the de facto GM. But it's now clear that even though MacPhail hasn't assumed that title, he's running the baseball operation from top to bottom.
Not only did MacPhail take total charge of the Orioles' recent organizational meetings, the previous de facto GM, Mike Flanagan, wasn't even in attendance. Asked to describe Flanagan's current role, one longtime baseball man replied: "Are you familiar with the word, 'G-H-O-S-T'?"






• Meanwhile, other clubs are reporting that the Orioles are listening closely when teams inquire about ace Erik Bedard. It might take three big-time young players to get him. But MacPhail has been telling teams he's willing to talk about Bedard or anyone else on the roster. Which could make the Orioles a major auctioneer this winter.
• We asked a scout who covered the Arizona Fall League to name the most eye-popping player and the most surprising player he saw. Here were his picks:
MOST EYE-POPPING: Devil Rays third baseman Evan Longoria -- "the most sure thing here."
MOST SURPRISING: Indians left-hander David Huff -- "should be a good third starter soon."
Finally, among the many fascinating tidbits you can find in the new Bill James Handbook, which hit stores this month, are baserunning stats of all kinds. We sorted through those numbers to determine the players who did the best -- and worst -- jobs of scoring runs after they reached base this season. Here goes:


OK, let's all sing along to the most stunning number in that whole list: "13 percent?"

PHILADELPHIA -- He was so much more than the voice of the Phillies. Harry Kalas was the Phillies.
He didn't just describe the games. His voice took hold of those games and made them his personal amphitheater.
The home runs weren't officially home runs until Harry Kalas told you they were outta here.
The long outs didn't make Philadelphia's hearts flutter unless the volume on every speaker suddenly quadrupled and Harry announced they've got  a  chance.
Strike three wasn't strike three until Harry The K gave it that little chuckle and reported some Phillies pitcher had just struck some poor, overmatched schmoe with a bat "right on outta there."
And when the impossible happened, when a World Series title run erupted in front of his eyes, his town couldn't be totally sure this mind-warping event had actually happened until the great Harry Kalas' golden voice exploded with the words: "The Philadelphia Phillies are 2008 world champions of baseball."
So here is what people like me, people who have lived most of our lives in Philadelphia, are wondering on this sad and tragic day:
How are we going to do this?
How are we going to go on in a world with no more "outta heres?"
How do we fill the unfillable void that will hang over us forever now as we try to contemplate life, and baseball, without Kalas?
Can't be done. Can it?
The games will go on. The sport will go on. Voices will crackle out of our TV speakers. That's the way it has to work. That's the way it has always worked.
But we don't have to pretend it will ever be the same, because when you've spent 6,000 nights, over four decades, listening to Harry Kalas put his inimitable stamp on a baseball game, it's way too simple to say baseball will never sound the same.
Baseball in Philadelphia will never be the same.
I'm one of the lucky ones. I got to know one of the special human beings on this planet. It was one of the great thrills of my career.
Once, I was just one of the fortunate hordes who had the pleasure of listening to Harry Kalas. Next thing I knew, I was working alongside him.
Back when I was a rookie beat reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer and something memorable would happen on the emerald field below me, I'd often find myself thinking: I wonder how Harry called that one?
His voice, his presence, was that powerful. Even when you were witnessing something live, with your very own eyes, you still felt as if you were missing something -- because you hadn't heard Harry describe it.
If it had been only me thinking those thoughts, I'd have gotten therapy and tried to get that little voice out of my head. But it wasn't just me. Ohhhhh no.
Those players down there were way more addicted to that voice than I was.
Back on May 10, 2002, Phillies center fielder Doug Glanville hit an inside-the-park home run, the only inside-the-parker of his career. You know what he remembers about it now? Kalas' call of that magic moment.
The second he crossed home plate, Glanville said, "I wanted to hear him announce it. That was every bit as important to me as running around the bases."
Wait. Hold on here. You mean this man had just done something very few human beings have ever done, and all he could think of was the sound of That Voice? How can that be, you ask? Because it was Harry. That's how.
"Harry had that special gift," Glanville said Monday. "Just with his words and the emotion in his voice, he could take you to that game and put you right in that moment. If I was trying to explain to somebody what it's like to hit an inside-the-park homer, I'd say, 'Just listen to Harry call it.'"
But it wasn't only Glanville. When something big -- especially something really, really big -- came along, Kalas' voice towered over the event like a thunderclap from the heavens.
Let me transport you back to April 18, 1987. It's a day I'll never forget. I got to see Mike Schmidt hit his 500th home run that day. But that's not the part I'll never forget.
The scene that is lodged in my brain forever was a scene that took place long after Schmidt's emotional home run trot. The interviews were over. The players were all dressed. The bus to the hotel was almost ready to leave.
Then Harry Kalas entered the room.
It just so happened that he and his broadcast buddies had brought with them a tape of Kalas' still-indelible call. And so, right then, right there, life in that room screeched to a halt. Everything stopped. The bus could wait.
All 25 players gathered around the tape recorder. The "play" button was pushed. And here came That Voice:
"There it isssss. Nummmmmber 500. The career 500th home run for Michael Jack Schmidt. And the Phillies have regained the lead in Pittsburgh, 8-6."
They listened to it once, and they roared so loudly the walls shook. So then they listened to it again. And again. And again. And again. Screaming just as loudly every time.
That's when it hit me: Even they didn't realize what had just happened here -- not until they'd heard Harry The K put it into words.
Well, you know what? At least those words live. Still.
I heard them all over the airwaves Monday. It's the one consolation on days like this. Because Kalas did what he did, because he uttered his special brand of poetry into a microphone, the words live on.
We need them now. We need to hear those words again. And again. And again. And again.
We need That Voice because it has been such a constant in all our lives for as long as most of us can remember. And not just at game time.
When I heard the sad news Monday, I called my daughter Hali -- one of the great Harry The K fans on earth. Through the tears, she told me she had just changed the ring tone on her cell phone -- to the sound of Harry Kalas calling the final pitch of the 2008 World Series.
Later, my wife, Lisa, tried calling our neighbors, Bob and Karen Scheur, because we knew they'd want to know. They weren't in. But their answering machine clicked on -- and there was Harry Kalas' voice informing us that Bob and Karen had just gone on a lonnnnnng drive, and they were outta here  so please leave a message at the sound of the beep.
"The funny thing is," Bob told me later, "that in November, Karen finally said, 'It's time to change the tape.' So we did. But as soon as we did, my friends would call and say, 'Hey, what happened to Harry?' So when it was time for pitchers and catchers, we changed it back. It's one of the rites of spring. Harry's back."
I could relate to that feeling -- totally. In fact, my last conversation with Harry came just a couple of weeks ago, in Florida. Pitchers and catchers had reported weeks earlier. The games had been going on for nearly a month. But for the first time ever, those games were going on without Harry.
He'd had some medical issues, described as nothing serious. So the Phillies were muddling along without him as best they could. And then, one day, I was walking down a ballpark hallway and there he was.
"It's a Harry The K sighting," I said. "Now we can finally get this season started."
He laughed. We shook hands. We talked a little baseball. He was ready to go. And now, so was I.
But I was only half kidding. It wasn't baseball season without Harry Kalas -- not for me. And not for millions like me.
So now what?
There will be a season. And in time, I'm sure, we'll be grateful there's a season.
But it will take some getting used to -- because, for millions of Philadelphians, Harry was what baseball sounded like.
If there's a rhythm to the heavens, if there's a script to every life, then we can take some solace in knowing there was an amazing finish to Harry Kalas' script.
In the final game he ever called, on Sunday in Denver, Matt Stairs gave him one final, dramatic, game-winning outta here.
Before the final home game Harry ever called -- on Wednesday, when the Phillies received their World Series rings -- he was handpicked by team president Dave Montgomery to throw out the first pitch.
And in the final postseason game he ever called, he got to tell all those people who loved him that the Phillies -- his Phillies -- were "2008 world champions of baseball."
That was their moment. But he made it his moment. And that's only fitting because, for the people of Philadelphia, Harry Kalas didn't just describe their moments. He made their moments real.

One thing we know about the Phillies is: They sure can corner the market on "Roys."
Apparently, Roy Hobbs, Roy Smalley, Brandon Roy and Siegfried & Roy were all unavailable this week. So instead, the Phillies traded for Roy Oswalt on Thursday.
And now they'd love to assume that just pairing him with Roy Halladay will be enough to restart the engines on their October Express.
But will it? Not everyone is so sure.
"It makes the division more competitive," said one NL scout Thursday. "But does it make the Phillies the favorite? No. I don't think it does, because of Atlanta's pitching. Their pitching is still really good. I think [Tim] Hudson, [Jair] Jurrjens and [Tommy] Hanson match up very well with Halladay, Oswalt and [Cole] Hamels. And Atlanta's bullpen is better."
Then there's Oswalt himself. His numbers are still great. His stuff is still dynamic. But he's been giving off a very different aura on the mound lately. And it's been enough to make some people wonder if that's a sign there's a very different pitcher behind that now-familiar face.
"This guy is not the same," said another NL scout. "He's been pitching lately like a guy who didn't want to be there [in Houston]. If he gets back to pitching like he did in the past and the beginning of this season, then the Phillies have a No. 1 or a No. 2 who is capable of doing things the guy they traded for him [J.A. Happ] couldn't do.
"But that's not the guy I've seen lately. The guy I've seen lately has made me wonder: Is he healthy? Is his back OK? Is he feeling his age? Or has he just had enough of Houston? Because he just hasn't been the same guy. He hasn't been the super-competitive guy he's always been. That's what he's got to get back to, and he's capable of doing that. If he does, then it's a hell of a deal. If not, I don't know."
We've also heard this same talk from other folks in the last week or so, as the Oswalt trade rumors erupted. We heard an executive of one NL team explain to us, for instance, why he couldn't envision overpaying for THIS Roy Oswalt because "I used to fear facing that guy. Now, I don't have the same fear I used to have when he took the mound against us."
You listen to those doubts, and they seem to mesh with Oswalt's own words and get-me-outta-here body language in recent weeks. But when you stack them up against his performance, it's hard to believe we're talking about a pitcher in any semblance of decline.
He ranks among the league leaders in quality starts (15 -- as many as Ubaldo Jimenez), WHIP (1.11 -- better than Chris Carpenter), opponent OPS (.652 -- better than Tim Lincecum) and strikeout/walk ratio (3.53 -- better than all but a half-dozen pitchers in the league). So that kind of gets your attention.
He's allowing a lower opponent batting average (.229), on-base percentage (.280) and OPS (.652) than he has in any season in his fabulous career. His strikeout ratio (8.4 per 9 IP) is his best since his rookie year.
And his swing-and-miss percentage (20.7 percent) is almost identical to that of Halladay (20.8), Carpenter (20.6) and Jimenez (21.0), according to our friends at FanGraphs.
So if this is how this man pitches when he's not into it, imagine what the Phillies might get if this trade gets his adrenaline pumping again.
And Oswalt is also heading into the time of year when he has traditionally been at his best. His career record in August: 28-7. In September: 26-9. In October: 2-0. That's a .778 win percentage (56-16) after July -- the highest among all active pitchers, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
And we should probably toss in Oswalt's REAL October stats. He's 4-0, with a 3.66 ERA, lifetime in seven postseason starts, and his team went 5-2 in those starts. So if the Phillies were looking for a man who has never shown any fear of The Big Game down the stretch, Roy Oswalt would seem to fit the profile.
Which means that if the Phillies can run him, Halladay and Hamels out there in the first three games of every postseason series, that's an October-ready rotation that stacks up with anybody's.
Except there's one minor catch:
They still have to get to October.
And even if their new co-ace magically morphs back into the Oswalt of yesteryear, his addition isn't enough, in and of itself, to make the Phillies' 3½-game deficit in the NL East and 2½-game gap in the wild-card madness disappear.
FanGraphs estimates he'll be worth about five extra wins to the Phillies over the next season-and-a-third -- but that computes to only about 1.2 wins over the rest of this season.
Meanwhile, the 6 1/3 innings he's been averaging per start represent only about one extra out per start over what the Phillies were getting from Jamie Moyer, the pitcher Oswalt is effectively replacing in the rotation. So that still leaves a lot of outs for one of the league's shakiest bullpens to slurp up every night.
Plus remember this: The dollars Oswalt adds to the payroll also figure to make it less likely that the Phillies can now deal for a reliever who makes even quasi-significant money.
And one thing Oswalt, for sure, can't do is make the Phillies' lineup any healthier -- or remind these guys how to score runs on the road. And that's become a huge issue.
Over their past 30 games away from Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies have hit just .234, averaged only 3.2 runs per game, won just one series (in Yankee Stadium, of all places) and played .300 baseball (9-21). And ohbytheway, they have 31 road games left this year -- starting with Oswalt's Phillies debut Friday in Washington.
So as one scout put it Thursday, "this deal probably sets them up for 2011 more than it sets them up for where they are right now."
But you never know with a team like this. It's a team that has gone to two straight World Series. It's a team that's built to go to another one. And it's a team that basically inspired its front office to make this kind of deal by running off a seven-game winning streak in the last week.
So in the week that led up to this trade, the Phillies put themselves in position to make another mad charge at the postseason. And Thursday, they went out and traded for the kind of pitcher who makes that charge a little more possible.
But Roy Oswalt doesn't change the face of the National League -- or even the NL East -- all by himself. This team has 62 games to play. Oswalt figures to play in only 13 of them.
So for the Phillies to look like geniuses, the onus is on the men who dug themselves this hole in the first place -- far more than it is on the ace they just airlifted in to (in theory, anyway) re-enact The Cliff Lee Story.

Once again this year, the relentlessly creative sport of baseball was stranger than Lady Gaga's taste in meat, stranger than the concept behind "Bridal Plasty," even stranger (believe it or not) than Brian Wilson's beard.
So before Ryan Seacrest instructs that big ball to start dropping in Times Square, let's look back at baseball's Strange But True Feats of 2010 -- arriving this year in five spectacular parts, spread throughout this holiday week. In Part 1, we explore the Strangest But Truest Postseason Feats of the year.
How strange were your official World Series champions, huh?
That lineup those unbeatable San Francisco Giants ran out there in Game 1 of the World Series had exactly two position players playing in the same place you could have located them on Opening Day. (That would be Edgar Renteria, at shortstop, and Aubrey Huff, at first base.) Not to mention 
A cleanup hitter (Pat Burrell) who had gotten released by the Tampa Bay Rays.
A No. 5 hitter (Cody Ross) who showed up as a waiver-claim special.
A No. 3 hitter (Buster Posey) who had started the year in the minor leagues.
A leadoff hitter (Andres Torres) who had been a six-time minor league free agent.
And precisely two position players who had ever made an All-Star team. (They were Freddy Sanchez -- who made it three times in Pittsburgh -- and Renteria -- who was batting eighth.)
So naturally, it was this team that won the World Series -- while winning games started by Cliff Lee, Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt, C.J. Wilson, Cole Hamels, Derek Lowe and Tim Hudson (among others).
In the previous half century in their franchise history, the Giants assembled teams so talented, they produced nine MVP awards, three Cy Young awards, four Rookie of the Year awards -- and won no World Series.
Then this collection of Giants came along and ended the third-longest title drought in baseball.
Of course it did.
• Joe Mauer has played in nine postseason games -- and lost them all. But he's never been part of a nine-game regular-season losing streak.
• The Reds scored the most runs and tied for the fewest errors of any team in the National League in the regular season. How did their postseason go? They had more errors (seven) than runs scored (four). That's how.

Conrad

• Just in the span of the first six ground balls hit to him in Game 3 of the NLDS, Braves second baseman Brooks Conrad committed as many errors (three) as Robinson Cano committed all season -- in 1,393 innings.
• The Rays had never allowed a runner to score from second base on an infield out in any game of their history -- then allowed two Rangers to do it in the same game, a fairly important Game 5 of the ALDS.
• And for sheer impossible, déjà vu box-score craziness, you can't beat Braves reliever Peter Moylan. Thanks to defensive debacles beyond his control, he unfurled exactly the same pitching line back-to-back in Games 3 and 4 of the NLDS: 0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 0 K, 0 HBP, 0 WP, 0 Balks. Just so you know how hard that is, only one relief pitcher in the past 60 years ever went all-zeros on us in back-to-back regular-season games: Dennys Reyes, on Sept. 20 and 23, 2001. Now that's October nuttiness at its finest.
• Cody Ross hit cleanup in zero regular-season games. So naturally Giants manager Bruce Bochy batted him cleanup in the clinching game of the World Series.
• Aubrey Huff has been to the plate 6,112 times in his regular-season big league career without ever laying down a sacrifice bunt -- the second-most sac-free trips of any active hitter. So who got a sac bunt down in the Giants' game-winning rally in the last game of the World Series. Right you are. Aubrey Huff.
• Guess how many three-RBI games Edgar Renteria had all season? Not a one. Of course. So was there even any doubt the only Giant with two three-RBI games in the World Series would be  Edgar Renteria?
• And guess how many home runs Renteria hit after April 27? That would be two. And how many homers did he hit in the World Series? Yep. That would also be two. That's why he's Mr. Nov-Edgar.
• Rangers first baseman Mitch Moreland hit no big league home runs against a left-handed pitcher all season. So who hit the Rangers' first home run of the World Series? Mitch Moreland -- off a left-hander (Jonathan Sanchez).
• The Giants went almost four weeks (from Sept. 26 to Oct. 20) without scoring more than four runs in a game. Then (naturally) they became the first National League team in history to score nine runs or more in Games 1 and 2 of a World Series.

Holland

• Not one American League pitcher all season had an outing in which he threw at least 13 pitches and had only one of them called a strike. But the Rangers' Derek Holland unfurled that terrifying line in Game 2 of the World Series: 13 pitches, 1 strike. Oof.
• And the craziest game of this World Series was Game 1 -- a game featuring 18 runs, 25 hits, 10 extra-base hits, six errors and 12 pitchers. Guess which two pitchers started it? Those noted bums, Tim Lincecum and Cliff Lee. Yeah, who else?
• The game-winning home run that put the Giants in the World Series was an opposite-field shot by Juan Uribe. So how many opposite-field homers did Uribe hit all season? Not one, of course.
• In Game 4 of the NLCS, both teams hooked their starting pitchers (Joe Blanton and Madison Bumgarner) before the fifth inning -- which was kind of unusual because they were both leading when they were pulled. How many times had that happened in a postseason game? That would be nada.
• Cody Ross hit five home runs for the Giants in the postseason. How many did he hit for the Giants during the season (in 33 games)? That would be three.
• When John Jaso caught Wade Davis in the Rays' Game 4 victory in Texas, it was the first time in 63 years (according to the Elias Sports Bureau) that a rookie catcher caught a rookie starting pitcher in a postseason victory. And how long did it take until it happened again? Until the next day, when Buster Posey caught Madison Bumgarner in the Giants' 3-2 NLDS win over Atlanta.
• Josh Hamilton walked four times in the second game of the ALCS. How many four-walk games has he had in his regular-season career? Yup. Zero in 468 games.
• Cole Hamels threw zero regular-season shutouts. So what did he do in his first postseason start? Throw a shutout, obviously.
• The Reds haven't had a no-hitter thrown against them in the regular season since June 23, 1971. So what happened in their first postseason game in 15 years? Roy Halladay no-hit them. What else?
• And what did the Reds do the game after having nobody get a hit? Their first batter (Brandon Phillips) the next game hit a homer. No team has done that in the game after a regular-season no-hitter since 2003.
• In the first postseason game of his career, Posey stole a base. How many bases did he steal in the regular season? That would be none.
• Lincecum has made 122 regular-season starts -- and never once had a game in which he struck out as many as 14 hitters and allowed no more than three men to reach base. So what did he do in the first postseason game of his career? Strike out 14 and allow only three baserunners. Naturally.
• In the four ALCS games in which the Rangers beat the Yankees, they won every one of those games by at least five runs. So when was the last time the Rangers' margin of victory in four consecutive regular-season games was at least five runs? Would you believe September 2006 -- 664 games ago?
• And CC Sabathia and C.J. Wilson faced 391 left-handed hitters this year and gave up four home runs combined. Then they both served one up in Game 1 of the ALCS. But we appreciate it. Without stuff like that, this Strange But True column just wouldn't be possible.
Coming Tuesday: "Team"-ing up for strange-but-true madness.

It was another one of those Strange But True years in the old trainer's room. It wasn't safe to hit a grand slam. It's never been more precarious to celebrate a grand slam. And even slipping on a shirt had the potential to land a guy on the disabled list.
So if all that could happen in the same year, you'd better buckle up your seat belt before you check out all the Strangest But Truest Injuries of 2010:
There's nothing better than a little pie -- if you work for Betty Crocker. But if you're Chris Coghlan? Hoo, boy. Pie will never be the same for this guy again.
We're betting right now this is one Marlins hit machine who won't be ordering pie a la mode for the rest of his life -- not after tearing his meniscus trying to slam a postgame pie into the face of Wes Helms after a July 25 walk-off.
Thanks to that half-baked mishap, Coghlan needed knee surgery that burned up the rest of his season. And that left such a bad, uh, taste in his mouth, he may never even be able to watch "American Pie" again.
We've been worried for years that a home run ball was going to get somebody hurt someday. We just thought it would be some bleacher creature working on his sixth beverage of the night -- not the guy who hit the home run.
But after this past season, we know different -- because five different players found a way to get themselves injured either before, during or immediately after the once-glamorous act of going deep:
• Angels power plant Kendry Morales wiped himself out for the season when he tried to jump on home plate after a May 29 walk-off grand slam and didn't quite nail the landing. Instead, he broke his leg and never took another swing all year. So kids, don't try that at home -- let alone at home plate.
• With one mighty swing of the bat May 21, Cardinals pitcher Brad Penny moved ahead of Mark Reynolds and Rickie Weeks on the Most Career Grand Slams charts (1-0). But that'll about do it for the good news. The bad news was, Penny also ended his season with that swing of the bat. Tore a lat muscle. Spent the rest of the season on the disabled list, savoring his Mickey Mantle moment.
• If you've never heard of the awesome wezen-ball.com, a site that keeps track of the fastest and slowest home run trots on earth, let's just say it was invented for moments like this. On June 30, Orioles thumper Luke Scott discovered he literally didn't know his own strength. He lofted a ball into the seats in left-center at Camden Yards, but unfortunately wasn't aware of that until it was a little too late. So he roared around first, blew out his hamstring and clinched the Slowest Trot of 2010 Award. Wezen-ball timed his orbit of the bases at a gimpy 35.76 seconds. But it took even longer than that for Scott to heal up and make it back into the batter's box -- after the All-Star break.
• It sounds kind of cool that the final swing of Jim Edmonds' career might have been a Sept. 21 homer against the Brewers. But you won't have to thumb through any copies of the New Yorker to find any poetic accounts of this memorable blast. The only reason it was the last swing of Edmonds' year, and possibly his career, is that he popped his Achilles on the way around third base. But we're happy to report that at least he made it home 7.5 seconds faster than Luke Scott did.
• There were 409 home runs hit last season by big league second basemen. Exactly one of them was hit by a Met. And even that one didn't turn out so hot -- because the guy who hit it (Luis Hernandez, on Sept. 18) never played again. But at least he can't blame his troubles on a trotting snafu. The issue here was that Hernandez had just broken his foot with a foul ball, one pitch before going deep off Tim Hudson. Didn't seem to mess up his swing any. But he was in so much agony when he began the rest of his journey, it took him 33.08 torturous seconds to stagger around the bases. "It was his Kirk Gibson moment," said Hudson, with exactly the right touch of I-don't-believe-what-I-just-saw awe.
Anybody could stumble into one goofy injury. But Mariners masher Russell Branyan doubled his calamities last season.

Branyan

First, he got ambushed by his hotel curtains in July, when he woke up around dawn, headed for the window to close the curtains and toppled over a coffee table -- which then fell on his foot and executed a squeeze play on his toe. Missed a week after that misadventure.
Then, in September, he found a way to get hurt during a family trip to the always-hazardous pizza parlor. And he wasn't even attacked by a runaway pepperoni.
The trouble started innocently enough, when his son kicked off a flip-flop. Branyan then reached one way to pick it up. His chair went the other way. So he wound up falling on his tailbone and missing the last three weeks of the season. Just more proof that nothing in life is more underrated than takeout.
We bet you thought the worst thing that could happen to a guy while putting on his shirt was discovering it was missing like three buttons. But that would look like a GQ cover gig to Astros utility whiz Geoff Blum, considering the stunt his shirt pulled on him in July.
There he was, innocently slipping on that fateful shirt after a game, when he felt his elbow pop. Next thing he knew, he needed arthroscopic elbow surgery to zap some bone chips.
Blum has since absolved the shirt of all blame. But Astros broadcast-witticist Jim Deshaies later told our Strange But True correspondents that he only used to worry about chips while removing his shirt:
"When I took off my shirt," he said, "the only chips they found were a half-eaten bag of Lays Potato Chips."
You might think it would have been tough for the Orioles to top that little Luke Scott home run-trot misadventure on this Strange But True Injury of the Year list. But wait till you hear this one.
Last winter, the Orioles innocently set out to film a promotional commercial, only to have one of their best pitchers (Brad Bergesen) hurt his shoulder by throwing too many pitches -- at game speed.
Bergesen then showed up in spring training with that shoulder hurting, and the poor guy didn't get his ERA under 6.00 until the second week of August.
Oh, and apparently the commercial didn't help much, either, since the Orioles finished 24th in the big leagues in attendance.
So find this team some stunt doubles!
Twins manager Ron Gardenhire undoubtedly thought he was going to get through the season unscathed when he made it all the way to the last week of September in one piece. But that'll teach him.

Gardenhire

One second he was just doing his usual pregame thing Sept. 26, taking throws at first base from shortstop J.J. Hardy during batting practice. The next, second baseman Alexi Casilla smoked him in the ear with a throw he never saw coming.
Within moments, Gardenhire reported, his ear "went ka-boom." And he wound up having ear surgery that day in the clubhouse, while the game was going on. But it could have been worse, he said: At least Casilla had finally showed off that great arm of his.
"Best throw he's made all year," Gardenhire told the Minneapolis Star Tribune's Joe Christensen. "I've been telling him all year, 'Quit lobbing the ball. Throw the ball, son.' Just didn't know he'd do it in BP when I wasn't looking."
• Marlins pitcher Ricky Nolasco essentially ended his season in August when he tore his meniscus -- while tying his shoelaces.
• Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson was stung by a scorpion.
• Dodgers catcher Russell Martin blew out his hip -- by turning to see if he'd just been called out at the plate.
• Mets pitcher Mike Pelfrey fell asleep on his flight back from the All-Star break, got scrunched in the wrong position and strained his neck enough that the Mets had to rearrange their post-break rotation.
• Phillies reliever Ryan Madson blew a save, took it out on the nearest folding chair, broke a toe and spent two months on the disabled list.
• Orioles manager Buck Showalter tweaked his knee arguing with an umpire.
• We're guessing Rays reliever Grant Balfour won't be making any future guest appearances on editions of "Monday Night Raw" after straining a rib-cage muscle in a "playful" pregame wrestling tussle with pitching coach Jim Hickey.
• Indians coach Ruben Niebla had to be carted off the field after wiping out his ACL during some "harmless" pregame shagging.
• Assuming we can believe the 78th different account of this, A.J. Burnett sliced up both hands -- and knocked himself out of a July 17 start in the third inning -- when he got teed off about the three runs he'd just given up in the first two innings, tried to slam the clubhouse door in frustration and cut himself on the lineup-card holders mounted on the door. Good times.
• Two different Pirates second basemen (Bobby Crosby and Neil Walker) got bonked in collisions with two different right fielders and wound up with concussions.
• Now Cardinals infielder Felipe Lopez knows how Jose Canseco once felt. Lopez aggravated his elbow in April -- by pitching in the Cardinals' 20-inning marathon with the Mets. Got a three-week visit to the disabled list out of it.
• Finally, Padres ace Mat Latos wound up on the disabled list after straining a rib-cage muscle -- in a not-real-successful attempt to avoid sneezing. And there are only three words for that: "Strange."  "True."  And "Gesundheit!"

We probably should have hauled in Jim Cramer or Maria Bartiromo to guest-author this edition of Rumblings, because the subject this week is the stock market.
We're not talking about the kind of stock you'll find on the S&P 500, though. Nope, here on the floor of the Rumblings and Grumblings Exchange, we're buying stock in starting pitchers this week.
With perfect games and near-perfect games busting out every few days, and Stephen Strasburg about to become the ultimate IPO, we surveyed 22 GMs, executives and scouts this week on this burning question:
Which five starting pitchers, aside from Strasburg, would you buy stock in today -- for the next 10 years?
We had two stipulations as we composed this field: All these pitchers already had to be in the big leagues to qualify. And all had to be 26 or younger as of July 1.
Meanwhile, to make sure our clients had a diversified portfolio, we imposed two rules on them: They had to vote for at least two right-handers and two left-handers. And they couldn't vote for any pitchers on their own team (which made some members of our panel very unhappy).
So which stocks were they trading in? Our intention was to take the five who got the most votes -- except we had a tie for the final spot. So you'll get six for the price of five. Here goes:

Hernandez

1. RHP Felix Hernandez, Mariners (age 24)
You might have thought Ubaldo Jimenez would be our leading vote-getter. Nope. It was King Felix, with 15 votes.
One big reason: His age. If you were wondering who was the answer to the trivia question, "Which active pitcher under age 25 has the most career wins?" that would be Hernandez, with 60 already.
But the other obvious reason is this: In case you hadn't caught on to this before, this man is one huge, strong guy -- with spectacular stuff. One GM said Hernandez might have the "best four-pitch package" in baseball. That word "dominant" came up a lot. And there was also a sense that, as good as The King is already, he could explode into a whole 'nother dimension one of these years.
"Only he knows how good he can be," said one AL executive.

Johnson

2. RHP Josh Johnson, Marlins (age 26)
Here's a shocker. The great Ubaldo didn't finish second in this race, either. Johnson actually outpolled him, 12 votes to 11, even though they're the same age.
So what's up with that? Well, the Josh Johnson Fan Club loves the chances of this 6-foot-7, 240-pound monster holding up to be "a horse for the next 10 years." Plus, quipped one panelist, "He's already had Tommy John [surgery], so he's got that out of the way."
But beyond the "absolutely overpowering weapons," our panelists kept extolling Johnson's "drive to be special" and his "great desire to be the best." He also has the aura of a star who's on the rise. Since this guy came back from his Tommy John surgery just before the 2008 All-Star break, he's 28-8 and has the best winning percentage (.778) among all big league starters not named Chris Carpenter (24-6, .800).

Jimenez

3. RHP Ubaldo Jimenez, Rockies (age 26)
OK, here's the man America can't stop talking about, even if half the people we polled did manage to stop themselves from voting for him. You've got us how anybody could not vote for a guy with a 0.78 ERA. But as one GM said, after leaving him off his list: "He's probably not going to throw 100 [miles per hour] for 10 years -- not that he needs to, to succeed."
Another concern is that Jimenez has had what the same GM called "some odd injuries," and that he has thrown more pitches the past two years (4,787) than any pitcher in his age bracket -- not to mention the third most in any age bracket. So as much as everyone loves Ubaldo Inc., some members of our panel were reluctant to buy this stock and hold it for a decade.
But the Ubaldo admirers didn't share any of those reservations. They see a "well-proportioned, coordinated man" with four unhittable pitches and "tremendous makeup." And for pure stuff, it doesn't get any more "ridiculous" than this.
"It's like facing a closer every inning," said one scout. And "you can just see guys saying, 'How am I supposed to hit this stuff?'" laughed another. So our clients can pass on this stock if they want to. But here at the Rumblings brokerage, we're buying -- in volume.

Price

4. LHP David Price, Rays (age 24)
The left-handed portion of this competition turned into a mad three-way scrum among Price, Jon Lester and Brett Anderson. And it came down to the very last voter before we closed the polls -- an NL executive who said: "Price proved he can pitch in the big moment. Lester proved he can pitch in Boston. Anderson still has to prove to me he can pitch in a race."
So we wound up with a virtual three-way tie on our hands -- Price with 11 votes, Anderson and Lester with 10 apiece. And Dodgers stud Clayton Kershaw (six votes) wasn't far behind.
We heard one scout say he was concerned about Price's pitch-ability as he ages. We also heard a GM express concern about whether he would stay healthy. But there isn't much to pick apart in a power left-hander with this formidable a "combination of size, stuff, pitch angle, intelligence and makeup."
Said one AL exec: "It will be fun to watch him battle with Anderson for best left-handed starter in the game over the next decade." Assuming they're both not battling Lester, too, of course.

Anderson

5. LHP Brett Anderson, Athletics (age 22)
Anderson might be the best-kept secret on this list. But that's changing fast. He was barely 21 when he first hit the big leagues last year, and it took him a while to settle in. But since June 29 (i.e., his past 22 starts), the only starting pitcher in the American League with a lower ERA than Anderson (2.73) is -- who else? -- Lester (2.60).
Anderson's issues this year with elbow inflammation scared off a couple of people we surveyed. But the rest of the panel thinks he's roaring toward greatness, assuming he can dodge his friendly neighborhood orthopedic surgeons.
He's "neck and neck with Lester for the best left-handed stuff in the game," said one exec. Another said he has always loved Anderson's "combination of touch, command and stuff." A third predicted: "This guy's going to be a perennial All-Star." Hey, that's good enough for this brokerage house.

Lester

6. LHP Jon Lester, Red Sox (age 26)
It's true that Lester is two years older than Price and four years older than Anderson. It's also true he's a cancer survivor, so there are always going to be worries about his health -- and not just the health of his left arm. But 26-year-old left-handers with stuff this radioactive seem as though they ought to be tough to leave off any list of stock picks to click.
After the first 102 starts of his career, Lester is an amazing 48-18 -- the third-best winning percentage (.727) after 102 starts, in the history of baseball, behind only Dwight Gooden and Ron Guidry. And in case you hadn't caught his act lately, this man is on a serious Cy Young kind of roll.
He has ripped off six wins in his past seven starts (with a blown save in the seventh). And he's the only starter in the American League who is holding all those poor hitters who have to face him to a sub-Mendoza batting average (.195).
"Dominant stuff, with a frame to match," said one AL exec. But what separates him, said another AL assistant GM, is that he "possesses three unique qualities: He is a dominant pitcher with elite ability. He is a tenacious winner. And he has proven to be extremely durable."
So it may be true that if you bid up this guy, you're buying stock in the only left-hander on this list who will be 36 in 10 years. But our advice to our clients would always be: Betting against Jon Lester to do anything is a dangerous idea.
Surprises: Zack Greinke (age 26) got "only" seven votes -- fourth most among all the right-handers on the ballot. We wonder where he'd be on this list if he hadn't joined the Royals' Witness/Winless Protection Program.   His fellow Cy Young incumbent, Tim Lincecum, stunned us by getting only three votes. But remember, we're buying stock for the next decade. And the same people who were once terrified of Lincecum's frame and delivery in the draft find the same issues "scary" now.  We also were surprised that Phil Hughes (age 24), Rick Porcello (age 21) and Matt Cain (age 25) got only one vote apiece, that Tommy Hanson (age 23) and Jaime Garcia (age 23) got just two votes each, and that Cole Hamels (age 26) and Clay Buchholz (age 25) got no votes at all. You think the vote totals for Hamels would have looked a little different if we'd taken this poll around Thanksgiving of 2008?
Rest of the vote: Zack Greinke (7 votes); Clayton Kershaw (6); Tim Lincecum, Ricky Romero and Brian Matusz (3), Tommy Hanson and Jaime Garcia (2); Matt Cain, Matt Garza, Phil Hughes, Francisco Liriano, Yovani Gallardo, John Danks and Rick Porcello (1).
Early Birds: You may not be able to trade for Roy Oswalt in the next 15 minutes. But two clubs that spoke with the Orioles this week say they'd listen to offers on Kevin Millwood right now.
Doesn't appear they're overwhelmed with interest in a guy who hasn't won a game yet in 12 starts as an Oriole. ("He's out there, but he's just a back-end guy," said an official of one club. "He's a third or fourth starter. It's just not ace-type stuff.") But Millwood's availability is the clearest sign yet that the Orioles have essentially given up on 2010 and are retooling for the 13th consecutive year.
And the impending firing of Dave Trembley would fit right into that line of thought, since there's no longer anything left of this season for this manager to salvage.
Cliff dwellers: OK, so you can't trade for Roy Oswalt right this minute, but how about Cliff Lee? Clubs that have touched base with GM Jack Zduriencik continue to report that the Mariners "have to make sure their season isn't salvageable" before they begin seriously contemplating dealing Lee.
But an executive of one team says he thinks Zduriencik could be tempted to move Lee today if he could get a package fronted by an impact bat "he could have around for a while." But it's hard to envision any contender trading away that kind of bat for a half-year rent-a-starter.
O no: We sense increasing pessimism out there that the Astros will be able to find a team willing to take on all of Oswalt's money and give up three centerpiece players to get him next month. But keeping him could be trouble for this team, too. If he still finds himself in Houston after the deadline, scouts who have cringed at Oswalt's body language so far are beginning to wonder if he'll be able to keep his sanity.
"Every time he goes out there," said one scout, "he's basically telling you, 'I'm finished here.' He's frustrated, and he's making it very obvious to everyone."

Changing Sox: As the White Sox drift out of the AL Central race, it's hard not to wonder if GM Kenny Williams will listen to offers on any of his starting pitchers. But longtime Williams watchers would be shocked if he deals anyone other than replaceable bullpen parts and possibly Paul Konerko.
"The thing you have to remember about Kenny is, he always expects to have a good team," said one rival GM. "If he doesn't think he can win this year, he still expects to win next year. So why would he move his [top four] starters? I don't see him doing that. He'll move a free agent, or bullpen guys he thinks are overpriced, because those guys are replaceable. But he can't replace a Gavin Floyd or a [Mark] Buehrle or a [John] Danks. So I don't see that one."
Meanwhile, one scout reports that he thinks rumors of Bobby Jenks' demise as a useful closer have been seriously overblown.
"I still think Bobby Jenks, with the right team, could bring them a decent return," the scout said. "His velocity is down a little, and he's throwing more two-seam fastballs. But I don't think his stuff has declined that much to where I'd think he can't close."
Ring that bell? As the Padres keep rolling, teams seem increasingly resigned to the idea that Adrian Gonzalez isn't going to get traded this summer -- not that some clubs (i.e., Seattle) don't continue to try. But officials of two different teams told Rumblings this week they could see the Padres trading Heath Bell even if they stay in the race.
"Bell is a lot easier to move than Gonzalez," said one. "I don't see why [Mike] Adams can't close, and just move everyone else up one spot. They've got plenty of arms out there."
Odd Cub out: When Lou Piniella abruptly decided to put Carlos Zambrano back into the Cubs' rotation, he kicked off a chain of events that look as though it's going to propel Tom Gorzelanny on to the market in a couple of weeks.
Teams that have checked in report the Cubs aren't shopping Gorzelanny yet. But when John Grabow comes off the disabled list later this month, that's likely to change, because the Cubs would no longer need Gorzelanny to plug that left-handed hole in the bullpen.
Then again, if Zambrano goes back to pitching the way he did before he got booted to the 'pen in the first place (7.45 ERA in his first four starts), almost anything is possible with this staff.

Strasburg

Operation Shutdown: If people in Washington thought the wait for Stephen Strasburg to arrive was excruciating, we're just warning them now: Enjoy him while you can -- because don't be shocked if the Nationals shut Strasburg down for the year in September, whether they're two or 22 games out of first place.
Strasburg will probably have somewhere between 100 and 110 innings left on his unofficial innings quota when he arrives in Washington. And he'll be joining a staff that will have about 20 turns through left the rotation before the season ends.
So the club might be able to get him through the year by instituting a tight pitch count or skipping a start here and there. But it's unlikely that he'll still be going out there all the way through September, barring an outbreak of Joba-mania.
"I don't know that he'll make it to Oct. 1," team president Stan Kasten told Rumblings. "I do think he'll get into September. But let's see."
So wouldn't the Nationals have a tough time pulling the plug on a guy this talented if they're still in a race? Of course. Much like the rest of us, they've noticed this fellow has a chance to be a serious difference-maker.
"But if that's what we thought and we didn't think long-term, he'd have been up on Opening Day," Kasten said. "But we've been disciplined about it from the beginning, and we'll continue to be."
Open Mike night: Strasburg won't be America's only mega-phenom to hit the big leagues next week. Sources have indicated that the Marlins will call up the minor league home run leader, Mike Stanton, sometime during their series in Philadelphia next week, Tuesday through Thursday.
It's still unclear whether the Marlins will send down Cameron Maybin or the incumbent rookie of the year, Chris Coghlan, to make room. But it appears they've now ruled out any sort of platoon between the two.
Not coincidentally, teams have calculated that the call-up date for players to miss out on hitting the Super-2 arbitration lottery is also going to arrive sometime early next week -- the latest date in the 29-year history of Super-2 status. In the short term, that's going to mean a big week for the old transactions column. But in the long term, it's going to mean something else entirely.
"I can guarantee this will be an issue in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement," promised one baseball man. "We either have to eliminate [the Super-2 concept] entirely, or it needs to be a set date. The way we're doing it now just isn't working."
The way they're doing it now, for those who haven't studied their CBA small print lately, is by percentage. Players with between two and three years in the big leagues qualify for arbitration only if they're in the top 17 percent of most service time accumulated by that group.
So as more and more teams delay recalling their prospects to slow their arbitration clocks, the "safe" call-up date has gotten later and later. And if they're going to push that date toward mid-June, that's hurting teams, players and fans. So let the debate on the best solution begin.

Batting around: Baseball people who have spoken to the Angels' brass since they lost Kendry Morales are convinced they'll be out there bat-hunting at some point -- but not for a few weeks.
For now, the Angels will try to fill Morales' spikes from within, mostly by giving Mike Napoli a shot to play a lot of first base following the return of fellow catcher Jeff Mathis. But they're also assuming the bat market will open up in July. At that point, they'll no doubt be shopping.
With Morales under control through 2013, though, the Angels would have no interest in someone like Prince Fielder, who has a year and a half left before free agency, because they're "not going to tie up that position with somebody who's signed," said an official of one club.
What they're interested in, the same official said, is either "a rent-a-bat or a dual-position guy -- somebody who could play first in 2010 but could move somewhere else in 2011." An executive of one NL club has a suggestion for them: Ty Wigginton, who is currently leading the Orioles in home runs (13) and just about every other major offensive category. Wigginton's versatility could make him the Mark DeRosa of this year's deadline crop.
"Ty Wigginton would be a great fit out there," the exec said. "He's got that Mike Scioscia kind of attitude. What hurts him is that when you look at him and the way he's built, you think he'd hurt you defensively at second, third or left [field]. But he's a way better athlete than people give him credit for."
It's also possible the Angels won't deal for a masher at all. They haven't ruled out looking for a leadoff man or a burner in the Chone Figgins mold.
Short circuit: An executive of yet another team that has spoken with the Orioles say they're "sniffing around for a shortstop."
"Of course, they've been looking for two years," the exec said. "But what they'd love to do is something like what Tampa Bay did a couple of years ago when they got Jason Bartlett -- find a guy who hasn't quite made it where he is now but who they project just needs a change of scenery."
One shortstop prospect who is rumored to have piqued their interest: Minnesota's Trevor Plouffe.
Fresh Prince: Here's one GM, on the possibility that the Brewers could decide to put Prince Fielder on the market in July: "It would be interesting to have Prince for a year and a half. Looking at his body, I'm not sure it would be interesting to have Prince for six or seven years."

Lincecum


Jimenez

Battle of the aces: Scouts who witnessed the much-ballyhooed Ubaldo Jimenez-Tim Lincecum duel on Memorial Day gave us this review of those two aces, two months into their season:
First scout on Lincecum: "I don't see as much fastball. The velo [velocity] is not down a whole lot, but I don't see the finish on any of his pitches, except the changeup, that I'm used to seeing. The ball's not jumping. The curveball's not finishing the same way. The only pitch that appears to be the same is the change, and he's throwing so many of them, it's not as effective.
"He threw six changeups to right-handed hitters, which is normal. But to left-handers, he threw 21 changeups. So that's close to 30 changeups in six innings. And he's pitching completely different when he's behind in the count. He's using the changeup more than ever, which says to me he doesn't think his fastball is doing enough, either."
First scout on Jimenez: "He finally seems to have figured out the timing and the tempo of his delivery. So the arm gets up there where it needs to be to locate the fastball. And he's locating fastballs to both sides, with movement. Before, he was going to throw a strike with that fastball and see what happens. Now he's locating with power to both sides, and mixing in that offspeed stuff. And if he can do that consistently, he's going to make a lot of hitters look silly."
Second scout on Jimenez: "Some of the stuff he throws up there, you just shake your head. Like I'm watching him pitch to Andres Torres, and he starts him off with a comeback sinker at 99 [mph]. Then comes an 89 split that just bottoms out. Then he goes to the top of the zone at 100, and [Torres] somehow lays off it. Then he snaps an 84-mile-an-hour downer hook, and it's see you later. Who does that stuff? That just doesn't happen."

Running on empty: When the Marlins started selling unused tickets to a game that had already taken place (Roy Halladay's perfecto) this week, it reminded us of one of our favorite goofy stats -- the non-attendance leaders.
We compute it by figuring out the capacity of every park, then subtracting actual attendance from potential attendance. Then we translate all those unsold tickets into the non-attendance leaderboard.
This is a longtime Marlins specialty. And they lead the league in that category again this year. So if they can keep figuring out ways to get fans to pay real money not to go see their games, they might even be able to afford to keep Dan Uggla around another year.
On that note, we now present the non-attendance leaders for 2010 (through Wednesday):
National League
1. Marlins 687,820 (31 dates)
2. Reds 611,491 (30 dates)
3. Padres 571,076 (30 dates)
American League
1. Blue Jays 931,873 (28 dates)
2. Indians 660,080 (22 dates)
3. Mariners 645,673 (28 dates)
Once again this week, let's check in with some of America's most brilliant scouting minds:
• On Ryan Howard: "Early in the year, he was staying on the ball and hitting more balls to the middle of the field than I'd ever seen. Now he's reverted back to this mindset where he can't get beat inside. So he's really spinning off the ball. He's easy to get out now. You just show him a couple of fastballs in, then go back to offspeed stuff away, and he's an out."
• On Chase Utley: "He looks like he's not seeing the ball. He's shooting the bat out like he's just trying to make contact, instead of firing the bat out to try and drive it. It just looks like he's not seeing it out of the pitcher's hand, and that's what's always made him so good, why he hits left-handers so well. He just sees the ball so well. But not right now."
• On Trevor Hoffman: "To be honest, I think his body is quitting on him. He doesn't have the arm speed to make his change effective anymore. That was always the one thing he had. Even after he lost his fastball, he still had the arm speed. And now it's gone."
• On Jaime Garcia: "This guy really impresses me. His stuff is real good. He's got two breaking balls that are both above average. But what's jumped out at me is he's very competitive. He's a nasty competitor. He has this aura like, 'I'm gonna beat your rear end.' Like when he faces the Pirates, he doesn't just want to beat them. He wants to embarrass them."
•  From Astros masher/humorist Lance Berkman (to MLB.com's Alyson Footer), on why he smashed his bat into the ground Monday after a game-ending strikeout: "There was a centipede crawling across the ground right in front of me and I didn't want it to bite any of the fans that stuck around, so I had to take care of it."
• From Rays manager Joe Maddon, on his rhubarb with ump Bob Davidson while the two found themselves approximately 5/8 of an inch apart: "There was definitely some intimacy about the whole argument."
•  From Phillies broadcast wit Scott Franzke to his trusty partner, Larry Andersen, after learning that the Marlins planned to sell unsold tickets to Roy Halladay's perfect game: "I'm thinking about buying a ticket to that game just to prove that you were there."
From the hilarious parody tweetster @UmpJoeWest, authored by a mystery man who identifies himself only as Not Ump Joe West:
• First prize: "Just had the family over for a cookout. My cousin brought potato salad which we already had, so i tossed him."
• Second prize: "Ken Griffey Jr to announce his retirement. I regret I never got to throw him out of a game."
• Third prize: "If I was calling Galarraga's perfect game bid, I'd change the strike zone to force walks. Too many perfect games. Disgrace."
Finally, this bulletin just in from the always-amusing goofballs at Sportspickle.com:

Nobody loves a good trade rumor more than Rumblings and Grumblings. But this just in:
While we've all been obsessing these last few weeks over Chad Qualls' next destination, some amazing stuff has apparently been happening on the field, too. Yeah, it's shocking. We know. But it's true.
So now that it's safe again to pay more attention to actual baseball than to Rumor Central, we want to direct your attention to five on-field stories you need to follow these last two months -- because it could lead these five men to a place where very few players have traveled in our lifetimes:
Could Votto win a Triple Crown? It still isn't out of the question. He leads the league in batting. He was leading in homers until Adam Dunn passed him Wednesday. And in the RBI column, Votto trails a guy who just landed on the disabled list (Ryan Howard) by only eight.


2010 STATS
HR27
RBI73
R75
OBP.423

And if the traditional Triple Crown doesn't work out for him, Votto is still on pace to win the "Modern Triple Crown" -- championed by my friend Joe Posnanski over at SI.com. He leads the league in batting, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. And if he can hang on, he'd become just the ninth man in the last half-century to win the all-decimal-point version of the Triple Crown.
But even if the Reds' big bopper doesn't win either trifecta, the "Double Crown" Votto is chasing would still land him in some cool company.
It isn't all that rare for a player to win two legs of the Triple Crown. But it's exceptionally rare for a guy to win the two legs Votto has the best shot at -- homers and batting average -- in the same season.
Barry Bonds never did it. Willie Mays never did it. Stan Musial never did it. Not in the same year, anyway. In fact, only three men ever did: Ted Williams in 1941, Johnny Mize in 1939 and Babe Ruth in 1924. Good group. Historic group. And Votto is in excellent position to join them. We'll keep you posted.
Speaking of men who could win the Triple Crown, we regret to announce that it's looking increasingly unlikely that Cabrera is going to be hanging out with Carl Yastrzemski, Frank Robinson and Secretariat. Over in the old HR column, Cabrera is seven behind Jose (The Bambino) Bautista -- and has homered only twice since Magglio Ordonez went down July 24.


2010 STATS
HR26
RBI93
R75
OBP.430

But Cabrera could still get to join Yaz and Robinson (though not Secretariat) in another cool group if he keeps doing what he's doing.
Cabrera leads the AL in extra-base hits. But he's also hitting .346, meaning he's second in the batting race to Josh Hamilton, a fellow whose .357 average is 53 points higher than his previous career high and nearly 50 points higher than his lifetime average.
So if Hamilton returns to earth and Cabrera goes on to lead the American League in hitting -- while also leading in extra-base hits -- he's putting himself in some amazing company. Only five players have led the AL in both categories since World War II -- and four of them (Yaz, Robinson, Mickey Mantle and Williams) won the Triple Crown the year they did it.
But to lead the league in extra-base hits without leading in homers, while still winning the batting title, is a feat we haven't seen in years in the AL. Last man to do it: Tony Oliva in 1964. Before him, you have to go back to Snuffy Stirnweiss in 1945.
Oddly, this has happened four times in the NL since 2000 -- by two Rockies (Matt Holliday in 2007, Todd Helton in 2000), plus Albert Pujols in '03 and Derrek Lee in '05. But before that, no one had done it since Hank Aaron in 1959.
So it's still a fantastic, and challenging, feat. And if you've watched Cabrera swing the bat lately, you know it's one that's well within his reach. For that matter, what the heck isn't within this guy's reach?
It's fashionable these days to dump on RBIs. We understand the reason for that. We readily acknowledge that, for most of baseball history, the good old RBI has been one of baseball's most massively overrated statistics.


2010 STATS
HR23
RBI81
R65
OBP.356

But somebody needs to drive in these runs. And no matter what you think of this stat, Howard has dominated it like nobody we've seen in years.
Now that he's stuck on the Phillies' disabled list for at least the next two weeks, he's probably lost his shot to join only Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the ranks of men who drove in at least 135 runs in five straight seasons. But Howard hasn't lost his chance to join a group that's almost as impressive.
He led the NL in RBIs in 2008, tied Prince Fielder for the RBI title last year and is leading again this year. If he can make it to the finish line with that lead despite his stint in DL limbo, he would become only the fourth NL player since RBIs became an official stat (in 1920) to lead the league three straight seasons.
The others to do it: George Foster (1976-78), Joe Medwick (1936-38) and Rogers Hornsby (1920-22). That's it. And ohbytheway, if Holliday hadn't gotten to play a 163rd game in 2007 (and drive in two bonus runs), Howard would be working on a fourth title in a row.
OK, there are two subplots we need to consider here. The first: What are the chances of Howard leading the league despite a stay on the DL? Well, as recently as last Thursday, he had a 10-RBI lead in this category, and that's already shrunken to three. So it won't be easy. But by the time he returns, the Phillies will be close, at least theoretically, to getting their full lineup back on the field for the first time since May. So there should be many, many RBI opportunities for this guy down the stretch.
And that brings us to the other element in this discussion: RBI opportunities. Granted, to achieve this feat, you need as many of those opportunities as you can get. And Howard has arrived at home plate with more runners on base than any player in the NL, according to Baseball Prospectus. He also finished third and sixth, respectively, in that department the previous two years. So this is a team feat, almost as much as it is an individual feat.
But that still doesn't make this a meaningless achievement. We know the sabermetricians don't agree. But particularly this year, as the Phillies' lineup has crumbled around him, Howard has been more important to his team than ever.
He also ranks second in the league in percent of runners driven in from second base and fourth in percent of runners driven in, period, among NL hitters with at least 450 plate appearances. So it's not as if these runs are all scoring by accident.
Now don't get us wrong. We're not asking anyone to worship RBIs. We're merely suggesting we shouldn't ignore them, either. Like everything in this sport, just put them in their proper perspective. It's not that complicated. Is it?
All right, so it hasn't been Lincecum's most dominant season. We can all agree on that. But in case you hadn't noticed, he's 11-5, with four blown saves by his bullpen, a 3.15 ERA and more strikeouts than innings. So he hasn't exactly been John Van Benschoten, either.


2010 STATS

BB58
K159

And one thing Lincecum continues to do, despite slightly less cooperation from his fastball, is make those poor hitters out there swing and miss. He leads the league in strikeouts, now one ahead of Roy Halladay.
Regardless of how that start goes, though, Lincecum remains in tremendous position to do something only the great ones do -- lead his league in strikeouts for a third year in a row.
If Lincecum outwhiffs the league again this year, he would join Randy Johnson (1999-2002) and Warren Spahn (1949-52) as the only NL pitchers since World War II to do that in at least three straight seasons. Only those three, plus Johnny Vander Meer (1941-43), have done it since 1940. And just those four and Dizzy Dean (1932-35) have done it since 1931.
It's happened more often in the AL, for some reason. But here's what hasn't: Lincecum will have done this in his first three full seasons (not counting his rookie year of 2007, when he made just 27 starts). And that's a feat we know is rare. We're just not 100 percent sure of how rare.
We know Lefty Grove and Bob Feller did it. We know Nolan Ryan and Johan Santana did it in their first three seasons as full-time starters, though not as full-time big leaguers. But we had a tough time coming up with a definitive list. So feel free to submit more nominees to uselessinfodept@yahoo.com.
In the meantime, we have no idea how long Lincecum's career will last, or exactly how many pitches it will take before his arm just flies off his shoulder. But for now, you should go out of your way to watch him do his inimitable thing -- because, as we've just proved again, he's still something special.
When we talk about great pitchers, it probably takes us a little too long to get to Wainwright's name. But that could change. Boy, could it ever.

We don't know what the odds are of anybody winning the Pitching Triple Crown in the Year of the Pitcher -- especially in a league that has Lincecum, Halladay, Josh Johnson and Ubaldo Jimenez in it (among other luminaries). But if you check your handy dandy stat sheet, you'll find Wainwright has a real shot at it.
To win the Pitching Triple Crown, you have to lead your league in wins, strikeouts and ERA. And in case you hadn't noticed, Wainwright is second in wins (two behind Jimenez), third in ERA (only 23 points behind Johnson) and fifth in strikeouts (just 11 behind Halladay). So it sure isn't out of the question.
In the division-play era -- or, in layman's terms, the post-Koufax-ian era -- only four NL pitchers have won that particular Triple Crown: Jake Peavy (2007), Randy Johnson (2002), Dwight Gooden (1985) and Steve Carlton (1972). Over in the AL, they're joined by Santana (2006), Pedro Martinez (1999) and Roger Clemens (1997-98). We're guessing you've heard of all of them.
Now is it realistic to think Wainwright can pull this off? Your first inclination is probably to say it's not. But not so fast.
He plays for a heck of a team, so the wins should keep on coming. He leads the major leagues in ERA over nearly the last two full seasons, dating to Sept. 1, 2008 (at 2.54), so there's no reason to think his ERA is going to explode. And he's averaging 8.25 whiffs per nine innings (a higher rate than Halladay) and seven innings per start, so he's going to pile up well over 200 strikeouts.
So while we're not going to predict Wainwright can do this, we're not going to predict he can't, either. What we can predict with total assurance is that we'll be watching -- because he's one of many plotlines that should make these last two months way more intriguing than waiting for, say, the next Jose Guillen trade rumor.
Owning up: There's an owners meeting coming up in Minnesota next week. And we don't have to consult Vladimir Shpunt to know already what the most contentious topic of that session will be:

How the heck were the Rangers allowed by MLB to add so many negotiable U.S. dollars to their payroll before the trading deadline?
Originally, we estimated last weekend that the Rangers had added about $6 million with their four major July deals. Turned out that was too high.
What we forgot to factor in was the payroll they unloaded in those trades (Chris Ray, Justin Smoak, Jarrod Saltalamacchia, etc.), plus the cash they got from Boston in the Saltalamacchia trade. So the actual amount they added to the books came to about $4.6 million. But that's $4.6 million more than some clubs thought they should have been allowed to add. That's for sure.
After learning last week that Texas had assumed more than $1.5 million of the $2.1 million Jorge Cantu still had coming this year, for instance, one GM erupted, muttering: "How'd they do that?    I'm not happy about that.  That ticks me off. It's not right."
And he wasn't alone. There will be multiple teams asking those same questions at those meetings next week. But we're hearing the official answer will be that the Rangers had, from the beginning, left room in the budget -- which MLB had approved for them months ago -- to allow for July acquisitions. So will that be the end of the conversation? We'd bet on no.
Who Dunn it? We'll never know exactly what happened to Adam Dunn on his way to the White Sox last week. But we do know this: The Nationals have been adamant since the trading deadline that they never offered to trade Dunn for Edwin Jackson -- not straight up, anyway.

Jackson


Dunn

Baseball men who have spoken with the Washington powers-that-be report the Nationals have consistently maintained in recent days that they never told either Arizona or the White Sox that a Dunn-for-Jackson trade worked for them.
What the Nationals did explore with Arizona, we've heard, was an expanded, multiplayer deal in which Jackson would have been a secondary piece. But that conversation never advanced beyond the "what about this" stage.
And clearly, the Nationals and White Sox later had numerous conversations about Dunn. But again, the Nationals have insisted to people they've confided in that Jackson would never have been more than a complementary piece for them in any White Sox deal, as well. And his $8.35 million salary for next year was always a massive obstacle.
But would they have taken Jackson if the White Sox had fronted the package with Gordon Beckham? We'd guess yes, in a millisecond. But would an offer of hot catching prospect Tyler Flowers, plus Jackson, have done it? Doubt it.
We've also heard that early on, the Nationals turned down a proposal of Flowers and Dan Hudson for Dunn. And they rejected prospect-based pitches from the Rays and Yankees for Dunn, too. Other clubs have confirmed that Washington asked for a "quality" big league-ready bat in any deal for Dunn. So Jackson's odd place in this scenario is going to remain a mystery for a long time, we'd guess.
In the meantime, looks as if, now that Dunn hasn't moved, the Nationals are most likely to turn their attention back to signing him to an extension. But the sides have been hung up on the length of that extension for weeks and are said to be looking for a creative solution. So we may not have heard our last Adam Dunn trade rumor for 2010 after all.
Ryan's hope: We never would have guessed that the most significant bat to change teams before the deadline would be Ryan Ludwick, not Dunn. But that's because Ludwick's availability was a better-kept secret than the location of the Chelsea Clinton wedding.

Ludwick

So how did Ludwick wind up in San Diego? The Padres had been monitoring Ludwick's recovery from a calf injury and asked the Cardinals about him several times but couldn't find a match. At the same time, Padres GM Jed Hoyer had been trying to deal for Jake Westbrook after a stealth run on Roy Oswalt went nowhere.
When it became clear late last week that the Cardinals were also homing in on Westbrook, Hoyer became the chief architect who, in the words of one source, "brokered" the three-team deal that sent Westbrook to St. Louis, Ludwick to San Diego and pitching prospect Corey Kluber to Cleveland.
But that trade still could have broken down as late as Saturday, if Westbrook hadn't agreed to pass on his $2 million relocation bonus -- because if the money hadn't worked, the Indians would have backed out of the deal.
However, Westbrook then agreed to go. The union signed off on the restructured contract. And the most fascinating trade before the deadline was, finally, a done deal.
Manny wouldn't: Could there possibly have been a more overblown story on deadline day than the tales that the Dodgers were fielding offers for Manny Ramirez? That deal was never going to happen.


Ramirez

The Dodgers quickly blew off the White Sox, who were merely offering to take $1 million of the more than $8 million left on Manny's contract, just in case the Dodgers had had enough of that act. Then, when word got out, the Rays and two other AL teams called, mostly just to kick Manny's tires for the fun of it.
But none of those teams came away with the feeling that Ramirez was actually available. And why would he have been? The Dodgers were one of the most aggressive buyers before the deadline. They're kind of desperate for offense themselves. And if Manny wants to play next year, he's going to need to (A) come back and play sooner or later, and (B) hit like Ty Cobb when he does.
Oh, and one more thing: Ramirez has a total no-trade clause. You think he'd have just waived that on deadline day without a perk or two being tossed his way?
Now if the Dodgers don't climb back into contention by the last week of August and Manny clears waivers, as expected, the team figures to have a very different approach. But what we saw Saturday was a classic example of how fast rumor can start looking like reality in this nutty world we live in.

Royalty: We didn't squeeze the Royals into our list of deadline winners last weekend. But the consensus of clubs we've surveyed is that they did well -- turning guys who were just passing through (Scott Podsednik, Rick Ankiel and Kyle Farnsworth) into a bunch of useful, controllable young players.
Most attractive of that bunch: 5-foot-9 left-hander Tim Collins, who is averaging more than 15 strikeouts per nine innings in the minor leagues and is viewed as Joakim Soria's future eighth-inning accomplice.
Speaking of Soria, we've seen no signs that the Royals ever had sincere interest in trading him. Not to the Yankees for Jesus Montero. Not anywhere else. Too good at what he does. Too affordable for too many years.
Deadline deals that never were: There's always fascinating stuff that gets talked about as the deadline approaches -- but never winds up happening. Here are some of the rumblings we heard:

Granted, the only deal the Rays were able to complete was their trade for Chad Qualls, but they were in on all sorts of big-time action. Turns out they made a more aggressive run at Cliff Lee in early July than people realized -- but would have had to move money (most likely James Shields or another veteran player off their big league team) to make room for him.
The Rays were also in on Dunn and explored a couple of scenarios to get Lance Berkman, including three-team options.
We've also heard that stories of Berkman's invoking his no-trade clause to turn down a deal to the White Sox weren't quite correct. He informed the Astros early on he wouldn't go to the White Sox but it doesn't appear he ever quashed a specific trade.
The Red Sox lost out on Kerry Wood, took a run at the Cubs' Sean Marshall and were one of many teams that got nowhere trying to deal for Seattle's Brandon League and Toronto's Scott Downs.
All those Jose Guillen trade rumors turned out to be nothing more than wishful Royals thinking. The Royals never had one team pursue Guillen seriously. If you're making a list of players whom teams should be most wary of claiming this month, Guillen might be No. 1.
The Angels never really got into "sell" mode. But an official of one club came away with the impression that one name you could see them dangle this winter is Mike Napoli.
The Rockies had more hits on Joe Beimel than any other player. But Beimel is such a low-budget asset, they never got serious about peddling him. If they cliff-dive this month, that could change.

Figgins

The Mariners tried to get teams like Atlanta interested in Chone Figgins in the hours before the deadline but got nowhere. An exec of a team that would have nowhere to put Figgins found that lack of interest a little odd, actually, since he sure didn't lack for suitors last winter. "So if you think he's the same player you liked then, only you get him for three years times $9 million, instead of four years times $9 million, why would you not be interested now?" the exec wondered.
We heard some faint talk of the Braves looking into acquiring Adam LaRoche yet again, in the wake of Troy Glaus' second-half disappearing act. But they decided to err on the side of loyalty to Glaus and backed off all their other first base options -- at least for now.
The Twins, Reds, Mets, Dodgers and even the Blue Jays tried to swoop in and deal for Wandy Rodriguez on Saturday. But the Astros never seriously entertained trading him.
The Reds were trying to drum up interest in Aaron Harang, even though he's been on the disabled list for a month with back spasms. Harang figures to be a potential August attraction if he resembles any semblance of his former self.
'Pen pals: Has there ever been a worse bullpen market at the trading deadline? Only four prominent relievers changed teams. Two of them -- Wood and Qualls -- were salary dumps. The other two -- Matt Capps and Octavio Dotel -- went for a heavy price.
But the Blue Jays and Mariners slapped high sticker prices on their "available" relievers and never budged. The A's kept their bullpen intact. And nobody else ever dangled anybody worth dealing for, other than some assorted reclamation projects.
So even though Billy Wagner and Jose Contreras got traded last August, don't expect much to change on the waiver-trade circuit this month.
"A couple of guys might pop out there," said one AL executive. "But I don't see somebody like a Scott Downs moving. At this point, Toronto will just hold onto him and take the [compensation] picks before they'd move him for what you can get in August."

Feel a draft: Finally, we're not sure exactly what it says about how the Nationals' negotiations with Bryce Harper are going, but we're hearing that when other clubs check in to ask about their talks with the No. 1 pick in the draft, the Nationals are already floating the hard line that if they don't get Harper signed, they'd happily take the No. 2 overall pick next year in what's viewed as a much deeper draft.
That's not exactly your classic, upbeat, don't-sweat-it-we'll-get-him-signed kind of talk, considering the Nationals now have less than two weeks to get this deal done. But whether it's spin or an indication that their negotiations with Scott Boras are in a danger zone, it's one more sign that teams are prepared to hang tough with their picks, now that the prospect of some sort of slotting system looms in the next labor deal.
"I'll say this," said an official of one team. "Considering that [Harper] is 17 years old, there's a good chance that No. 2 pick next year gets to the major leagues before Bryce Harper."
Once again this week, we check in with baseball's most incisive scouting minds.
•  On Brett Wallace: "I don't get it. He's always in demand. People always want him. But as soon as they get him, they're willing to move him out the door. So what am I missing?  If I was going to hang my hat on a [young hitter] to say, 'This guy will hit in the big leagues,' he'd be right at the top of the list."
• On J.A. Happ: "For me, he's at least a No. 3 starter -- at least. The people who say he's just a fifth starter are people who saw him when he first came up and don't actually watch him. He's better than that. This guy is smart. He has a great feel. And guys swing through his fastball."
• On Kyle Farnsworth: "He's pitched better this year. He's quit trying to pitch like his hair is on fire. I think his stint as a starting pitcher this spring really helped him. It got him to pitch more like a starter. He's slowed things down. He's had a good changeup. He's actually been a usable guy."
6 -- Number of Opening Day starters who have gotten traded in midseason over the last three years: Oswalt, Dan Haren and Westbrook this year; Jake Peavy and Cliff Lee last year; CC Sabathia in 2008.
104 -- Number of specially marked "600th homer" baseballs that Major League Baseball ran through until Alex Rodriguez finally hit one of them out.
185 -- Number of players who hit a home run during the week and a half while A-Rod was still trying to figure out how to get from 599 to 600 homers. That group included a pitcher (Yovani Gallardo), a fellow who hadn't homered in his previous 809 at-bats (Juan Pierre) and two Rodriguezes not named Alex (Pudge and Sean).
• From legendary Brewers broadcast-witticist Bob Uecker, after returning to the booth following heart surgery, on how he thought his surgeons would do throwing out the ceremonial first pitch: "I hope they do better than they did on my incision."
•  From Nationals pitcher Miguel Batista, when told that his favorite beauty contestant, Miss Iowa, had been practicing her pitching before throwing out the first pitch in Washington last weekend: "Really? Well, if she thinks I'm going to be practicing the swimsuit and the high heels, not a chance."
• From Miss Iowa herself, Katherine Connors, after tossing out that first pitch to Batista -- and keeping it airborne all the way to home plate: "I think I could probably take his job after that pitch."
From the great Eric Stangel (@EricStangel), "Late Show" writing genius and Twitter sports-quipster supreme, on the Yankees' trade deadline acquisitions:

You don't need Rumblings and Grumblings to tell you that Cliff Lee, Mariano Rivera and Rafael Soriano are the three most ballyhooed free-agent arms that money can buy this winter.
But who ELSE belongs on your free-agent shopping list? Rumblings has been breaking down the numbers of this year's pitching crop. And you might be stunned at some of the names that popped to the top of those statistical rankings. So let's take a look:

Padilla


De La Rosa

If we asked you which starting pitchers in this market have the best stuff, we're not sure how long it would take you to recite the names "Vicente Padilla" and "Jorge De La Rosa." But those two are, against all odds, the correct answers. For pure swing-and-miss stuff, those two probably even rank, on their good days, above Lee.
Lowest opponent batting average in 2010 against any free-agent starter? That would be Padilla's .226. He also had the second-best strikeout rate (7.96). And only Lee had a better WHIP than Padilla's 1.08.
The No. 1 strikeout rate on the entire free-agent list? De La Rosa's 8.36 whiffs per nine innings beat all the free-agent starters in the field. And his .235 opponent average was second only to Padilla.
So does that mean it's time to go out and give these guys A.J. Burnett money? Noooooo. Not according to the people we surveyed.
With De La Rosa, said one NL executive, "what you're getting is top-of-the-rotation stuff, but the consistency doesn't warrant top-of-the-rotation dollars. He just doesn't get you deep enough into the game consistently."
Padilla, meanwhile, has health issues (elbow, neck) that add an extra tier of terror to the usual level of trepidation that teams have long had about his ability to match up his performance -- and, just as important, his off-the-field professionalism -- with his talent.
"He has really good stuff on certain days," said the same exec. "But there are other days where, even though he takes the ball, he doesn't really [show up]. The only place I'd feel comfortable with Padilla is an incentive-laden contract, where you'd pay him to pitch the way a bona fide third starter gets paid, but the only way he'd get that money is you'd backload it with incentives. Then if he meets the incentives, he gets the money. But you can't guarantee it. He's too hard to trust."

Pavano

Guess who led all free-agent starters in wins and innings this season. If you guessed Cliff Lee, it's time to re-examine your stat sheets. The answer: That would be Carl Pavano, ladies and gentlemen, with 17 wins and 221 innings.
But does that mean it's time for somebody to wipe Pavano's debacle in the Bronx off his slate and pay him like a legit, dependable, difference-making horse? Uh, let's not get carried away.
"He's all about comfort," said one exec who has a history with Pavano. "When he's pitching for a contract or pitching in that comfort zone, he gives you starts, he gives you innings, he's a horse. But take him out of that comfort zone, and put a lot of emphasis on him winning and being productive and it's not a contract year, and I think you'll always see a dip in performance.
"Now maybe, after last year, he may be beyond that a little. He's made his money. He's more mature than he's been. But he needs that mid-market environment. You still can't trust him in a place like New York or Boston. … In general, I think if you get him as a fourth starter, an inning-eater, someone to take the ball, that's a good [role]. But if you're looking for more out of him, if you think you're going to be able to really rely on him to produce and win, I'd be wary about that."

Fuentes

Perception and reality often diverge this time of year. The perception of Brian Fuentes is that he was never quite what the Angels signed him to be. Yet if you look at your handy-dandy free-agent bullpen stats, here's what you find:
Left-handed hitters hit .128 against Fuentes this season -- the best rate of any left-hander on the market. All hitters -- left and right -- batted .181, which places him at No. 3 on the free-agent charts (ahead of even Mariano Rivera). And Fuentes' strikeout rate -- 8.81 K's per nine innings -- ranked second among all free-agent left-handers.
So he might be a better buy than many people are giving him credit for.
"You know what? He's deceptive," said one scout. "He's got that swing-and-miss changeup, and it's still a good pitch. I've been shaking my head on him since I saw him in the Eastern League. But he can still get you out. You've just got to be numb to the side effects of deep-count pitching."

Choate

So how many years would you guess Randy Choate has hung around the big leagues now? Five? Six? Nope. How about 10?
Yes, it's as great as ever to be left-handed and breathing, all right. And while Choate's 4.39 career ERA, and his 4.23 ERA this season, may not make him Billy Wagner, he has his niche.
Left-handed hitters batted just .202 against him -- the third-best opponent average of all the free-agent left-handers. His ground-ball rate (1.55 for every one fly ball) was No. 1 among all free-agent left-handers and No. 2 among all free-agent relievers -- period. And he's one of only six free-agent left-handers who struck out more than eight hitters per nine innings (8.06, to be precise).
So while Scott Downs and Pedro Feliciano may march at the front of the situational-left-hander parade, good old Randy Choate is right behind them.
"A pure matchup guy," said one NL scout. "In his role, those numbers don't surprise me. He just needs a good manager. A good manager matches those kinds of guys up with hitters he knows he's going to get out. Put Randy Choate in that role, and he'll do a good job."

Benoit

There isn't even a question who the most unhittable relief pitcher in baseball was in 2010. And it wasn't Rafael Soriano, Mariano Rivera or Brian Wilson. The actual answer: Joaquin Benoit. If you haven't checked out his insane numbers, here goes:
Benoit's ERA was 1.34 -- No. 1 among all free-agent relievers. His opponent batting average was .147, also No. 1. His opponent on-base percentage: .189 (No. 1, of course). And his opponent OPS was .454 (likewise No. 1).
So that explains why a guy who could get himself only a minor-league deal (from Tampa Bay) last winter just agreed to a three-year, $16.5-million deal with Detroit, according to ESPN Deportes' Enrique Rojas.
"I love Benoit," said the NL exec quoted earlier. "I'd be one of the nuts who'd take a chance on him to close. I know he's never closed successfully anywhere. I know he doesn't like to close, and he's said that.  But he was as good as any eighth-inning guy has ever been. His numbers were off-the-charts ridiculous. And he proved he can handle the wear and tear of getting up and down.
"I know we get hung up on the ninth inning, but in some ways pitching the eighth is even more difficult, because it's not all laid out for you. You don't always get that clean inning. And he handled it great. His stuff was electric.
"The thing with him before this year was, he was a guy you always said goes as his split [fingered fastball] goes. And his split never left him this year. And his change was also an out pitch. That pitch disappeared on him in Texas, but it came back this year. So he was out there throwing 93-94 [miles per hour] with a plus change and a plus split. Before, he didn't have the secondary out pitch to handle right-handers and left-handers. But now he does. So I'm sold."

Uehara

For two years, the Orioles employed one-time Yomiuri Giants great Koji Uehara and never seemed too sure what the heck he was. He started. He set up. He spent a thousand nights in the trainer's room. And then, when Buck Showalter showed up, he became the emergency closer.
Well, if you stack up Uehara's numbers against the rest of the free-agent bullpen crop, you could understand why.
Who had the No. 1 strikeout rate of all free-agent relievers who pitched 40 innings or more? That would be Koji Uehara (at 11.25 per nine innings).
And once you got past the Benoit-Soriano-Mariano Big Three, who led all right-handed free-agent relievers in opponent OPS and on-base percentage? That would also be Koji Uehara (at .594 and .243, respectively).
"What exactly is Koji Uehara?" mused one scout. "I'm really not sure. But I know he was awesome for two months."
But Uehara's other eye-popping number was 103 -- as in the number of days he rolled up on the disabled list the past two years. And we're finding that's the number teams shopping for him can't get out of their heads.
"This guy logged a lot of innings in Japan," said one exec. "And that's what I'd have to think long and hard about, plus his injury history in Baltimore. Everyone thinks that if you get what he was in August and September, you'd get a high-impact guy. And you would. He's got plus command and a plus split, and he can pitch. But the health history and the innings are exorbitant. So he's your classic high-risk, high-potential-reward guy."
Then again, that's a great description of free-agent bullpen shopping in general: You've got to take the risk. And you pray you get rewarded.
But you can't go shopping without doing your homework first. And sometimes, when you do that homework, it's shocking what you can find. Randy Choate? Koji Uehara? Vicente Padilla? Just remember, when your favorite team signs those men, you heard it here first.

Gonzalez

• Yo Adrian: Even if Adrian Gonzalez had no health questions, it was probably only about a 50-50 shot that the Padres were going to trade him this winter. But Gonzalez's recent surgery to "clean up" the labrum area in his right shoulder downgrades those odds considerably -- at least for now.
Gonzalez told the San Diego media corps this week that he should be ready to play by the end of spring training. But other clubs are hearing talk that he won't even swing a bat until March. So that's not what you'd call a great incentive for teams to charge in there in the next few weeks and trade three big-time prospects for this man.
"I think that complicates this for them [the Padres]," said one front-office man. "And it's got to be a concern for any team. They can always keep him and trade him at the deadline if they're out of it. But suppose he starts slow. … Then it gets even harder for them to get a real return."
But if the clubs floating this talk think it means they have a shot to get Gonzalez on a discount, uh, good luck. You can expect the Padres to argue that this wasn't a serious injury or a serious surgery, that Gonzalez was healthy enough to start every game after July 3 and that, given the kind of dollars he'll be chasing next winter, it's a stretch to question either his health or his motivation as heads into the biggest season of his life.
Nevertheless, we'd bet this won't be the last time you hear about Adrian Gonzalez's labrum between now and his first multi-homer game.
• Cut bait: It will be fascinating to see where Dan Uggla's contract negotiations go now that it's the Braves he's negotiating with.
The Marlins clearly concluded that, despite all his talk about wanting to stay, he wasn't going to sign no matter what they offered. And in this case, they might be right -- because the question we kept hearing from other teams on Uggla was this:
How could he not have taken the four years and $48 million the Marlins threw at him?
Good question. Only one second baseman in baseball has a contract that will guarantee him more, in ANY future season, than the $12 million a year Uggla turned down. And that's Chase Utley, who will get $15 million from the Phillies in each of the next four seasons.
Elsewhere, Robinson Cano has club options at $14 million and $15 million in 2012 and 2013. But Brandon Phillips' deal tops out at $11 million. Brian Roberts' deal pays him $10 million a year. Dustin Pedroia's contract peaks at a $10 million guarantee, with an $11 million club option in 2015. Ian Kinsler has a $10 million club option in 2013. And Chone Figgins, who signed as a multi-position bat, won't earn more than $9 million a year.
"So he might find," one NL exec said of Uggla, "that teams just don't want to pay the kind of money he's asking at that position."
How, then, could Uggla's agents, Gregg Clifton and Terry Bross, justify asking for five years and $71 million? Here's their selling point: Uggla is one of only four right-handed hitters who has hit at least 30 homers in each of the past four years. The others: A-Rod, Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera. And yep, they're all earning well above $12 million a year.

Zambrano

• Northern Exposure: All of a sudden, the Cubs seem a lot less inclined to deal players like Kosuke Fukudome and Carlos Zambrano than they were a few months ago. And for that, you can credit the Mike Quade Effect.
How much difference did Quade make? Well, the Cubs went 24-16 in the 40 games he managed -- after going 24-42 over the final 66 games Lou Piniella managed. And the changes didn't just show up in the standings.
Scouts who followed the Cubs said they saw young players and the bullpen crew, in particular, relax and perform without the high-strung Piniella around. And Fukudome was also a different guy, hitting .277/.390/.482 (with more walks than strikeouts) from Aug. 20 on -- after hitting .258/.365/.425 before that.
"He needed a change of scenery," said one executive. "And he got it -- without going anywhere."
Meanwhile, we're hearing the Cubs have gotten some "feelers" on Zambrano's availability. But his big finish (8-0, 1.58 ERA after his suspension) has eliminated any sense of urgency the Cubs might have had to move him and eat a bunch of money to do it.
Other teams report the Cubs would still talk about Zambrano. But he has a full no-trade clause, and has salaries of $17.875 million and $18 million coming the next two years, plus a vesting $19.25 million option for 2013.
So for the Cubs, said an official of one team, "this is not like last year, when moving Milton Bradley was a had-to-be-done kind of move."
• Off The Matt: We keep reading and hearing those Matt Kemp trade rumors. But an official of one team that kicked those tires reports: "They ain't trading Matt Kemp." One reason, obviously, is that Kemp's talent is irreplaceable. But another is that Kemp had a great relationship with his new manager, Don Mattingly, and the Dodgers are betting he'll have a big year.
One guy the Dodgers would talk about if they could fill a big pitching or left-field hole is first baseman James Loney. But they'd need to save money and they'd want to move Loney fast, so they could replace him with one of the free-agent first basemen out there.

Werth

• Philling Up: Since the Phillies felt such a strong need to refute last week's Rumblings report that there's "zero" chance they can re-sign Jayson Werth, let's clarify that.
That note was never intended to imply that the Phillies weren't trying to keep Werth. But "zero" was simply a realistic assessment by one Phillies official of what he believed the chances were, based on the three-year deal the Phillies have been willing to talk about -- compared with the 5-7 years agent Scott Boras is kicking around.
All you need to know is that they continue to explore numerous options for replacing Werth. They've done what one source described as "extensive" groundwork on a potential deal for the White Sox's Carlos Quentin. They remain interested in Jeff Francoeur to play against left-handers. And while they have mild interest in Jermaine Dye, that appears to be on just a back-burner, spring-training-invite level.
Despite rumors floating around Philadelphia that the Phillies would be willing to trade Shane Victorino to clear dollars (and center field) for Werth, teams that have spoken with the Phillies report there's no evidence they're actively moving down that road.
• What's He Werth: One more Jayson Werth note: The Red Sox have been widely portrayed as the favorites to land Werth, and they're clearly interested. But an official of one club who spoke with Boston says, flatly, that if Boras is determined to get $100 million for this guy, "he will NOT be a Red Sox. I'll tell you that."

Dunn

• Not A Dunn Deal: Here's another popular free-agent theory that keeps getting shot down: Adam Dunn heading for the Cubs. One NL exec who spoke with the Cubs' brass reports they're finding it "hard to get excited" about Dunn, much as they like his bat. With a 21-year-old (Starlin Castro) at short and uncertainty at second next year, the Cubs have told people they want an above-average defender at first. And much as we love Adam Dunn, "above-average defender" isn't how anyone would describe him.
• Eye Of The Tigers: Beyond Werth and Carl Crawford, Victor Martinez might be the most attractive bat on the market. But one AL exec offered this prediction:
"I'd bet on the Tigers signing Victor Martinez. They're motivated. They really like him. He fits their team. He can catch some with [Alex] Avila and DH some. They saw a ton of him in their division all those years when he was in Cleveland. They like his makeup. I just think they value him more than the other teams he's been connected with."
• A New DL.: One item on the agenda at the GM meetings this week was potentially adding a seven-day disabled list for players who suffer concussions and, conceivably, other injuries that wouldn't keep them out for 15 days. Excellent idea. But don't expect to see it implemented until 2012.
• The Average Bear Market: Finally, Scott Boras is out there marketing Kevin Millwood -- who is coming off a horrendous year (4-16, 5.10) -- as a great buy for teams that play in a big pitchers' park. But when Rumblings asked one scout which park would be a good fit for Millwood, his immediate quip was: "Jellystone."
Joe Mauer just became the second catcher ever, and also only the second active player, to have at least three consecutive seasons in which he won a Gold Glove AND Silver Slugger award. Then again, only 10 other players have done it at any position in the three decades since the invention of the Silver Slugger. Here's that distinguished list:
Pudge Rodriguez 1994-99 C
Ken Griffey Jr. 1996-99 OF
Barry Bonds 1990-94 OF
Ryne Sandberg 1988-91 2B
Kirby Puckett 1986-89 OF
Don Mattingly 1985-87 1B
Dale Murphy 1982-85 OF
Dave Winfield 1982-85 OF
Lou Whitaker 1983-85 2B
Mike Schmidt 1980-84 3B
Let's check in again with America's sharpest scouting minds, on what they saw in the Arizona Fall League:
• On Giants 1B Brandon Belt: "You can have Brett Harper. Give me that kid. He's got a chance to be Larry Walker. Athletic. Powerful. Good defender. And he hits the ball line-to-line with thunder."
• On Cubs pitching prospect Chris Carpenter: "Easy power stuff. Great life. This guy has a chance to be a front-of-the-rotation starter."

KYOTO, Japan -- A late-night stroll through Kyoto reveals white-faced geisha, the mysterious teahouses of Gion, the millennia-old Shinto shrines ... and a small red and blue sign for a bar named Fenway Park.
Wait a minute. Fenway Park? What the hell?
A shake of the head and a short ride in a cramped elevator later, you walk into a little piece of Beantown here in Japan's most traditional city. It's complete with Red Sox memorabilia on the wall and Sam Adams in a bottle. A Boston fan named Yasuyuki Ohta holds court behind the bar he owns with his brother.
"Yankees suck," Ohta says, some of the only English he knows.
The World Series might start in Detroit on Saturday night; but for Red Sox fans from Kenmore to Kyoto, it's already next year. The only World Series that will be playing at the Ohta brothers' bar this week is the one that was played in October two years ago. They've got a highlight tape, and that's what is thrown up on a wall by a projector.
They're stuck in 2004 in this third-floor Kyoto pub. Curt Schilling always pitches through the pain and the Cardinals always lose in four straight. Last week, five New Englanders bellied up to the bar. They'd flown halfway around the world to experience a new culture, but a little taste of home is never a bad thing.
So the 2004 championship video played, and they cheered at the appropriate parts. Kevin Millar looked into the camera and said, "If they're watching in Japan, we'll show them, too."
Well, they were watching. A few locals and the New Englanders. One of them, Mary Anne Baker, read about this place in the Boston Globe, so she came bearing gifts: a copy of the article and a new Red Sox hat. Like everyone, she was curious about exactly how this bar came into existence, an incongruent oasis, more out of place than Toby Keith at a sushi counter.
It started, predictably, with a love of one team and a hatred of another.
In Japan, the Yomiuri Giants are like the Yankees and the Hanshin Tigers are like the Red Sox. The Tigers even come with a curse, and it's way wackier than anything having to do with the Bambino. In 1985, during a post-Japan-Series-win euphoria, fans made Tigers look-alikes jump into an Osaka canal . . . except no one could find a local who looked like star Randy Bass. So an enterprising Tigers backer grabbed a statue of Kentucky Fried Chicken's Col. Sanders. In he went.
No one ever found the Colonel, and the team is allegedly cursed until someone does.
Ohta has always loved the Hanshin Tigers. That means he had love for their brothers-in-curses in Boston. So, 15 months ago when he quit his job as an engineer and realized his dream of owning a bar, he didn't have to think hard for a name: Fenway Park.
It meant he got to show off his team pride. And he knew that every American who walked by and saw the small sign would have to go upstairs and see what in the name of Carl Yastrzemski is up with this place.
"A lot of tourists visit Kyoto," he says, "and Kyoto is Boston's sister city."
The bar is easy to miss; but once you find it, you don't have to move for a while. It stays open until 5 a.m. It's on Kawaramachi-Dori, a main drag near the river, right across from the Kyoto Royal Hotel & Spa.
That's where the New Englanders were staying. When they arrived in Kyoto, before checking out the Shogun's castle or the spectacle of a tea ceremony, they walked over for a few drinks and a few laughs. The locals certainly got a kick out of their cahs and pahks and bahs, and the tourists no doubt got a kick out of the profound weirdness of the whole scene.
Thousands and thousands of miles from New England, they raise their glasses. And you know what? They aren't really that far away from home at all. They're at Fenway Park.
"We made a toast, and we toasted to next year," says Pat Morrison. "Every Boston fan knows that."

CLEARWATER, Fla. -- It was never Craig Biggio's ambition to become the most versatile middle-of-the-diamond player in baseball history. Some things in life you don't plan. They just evolve. Like reality shows. And Jennifer Lopez marriages.
No one sets out to be an All-Star catcher, then an All-Star second baseman and then, at age 37, a center fielder in a ballpark with its own hill and flag pole in center field. You never saw Yogi Berra or Johnny Bench try anything that wild. There's a reason for that.
It wasn't Craig Biggio's dream to become not just the first Houston Astro in history, but the first player in history, to be a regular at all three of those positions. In fact, in retrospect, he's still wondering how he ever survived the move from catcher to Mazeroski-ville 11 years ago.
"I would never say this when I was still playing second," Biggio says now. "But going from catcher to second base was like telling me I'm going to be the president of Wal Mart tomorrow. That's how out of place I felt. So this is just another challenge. I'm excited about it."
When it comes to the art of playing center field, he knows nobody is sitting around this spring saying, "Boy, he reminds me of Andruw Jones." But Biggio can't imagine any way this could be tougher than that other move he made 11 years ago.
"That was one of the hardest things I ever had to do in my life," he says. "I can't express how difficult that was. I was a catcher my whole life. Then I had to learn a new position in the big leagues. And everything about it was so different.
"As a catcher, everything goes away from you. As a second baseman, everything is coming at you. So you're in the field, and you've got to concentrate every second: 'Who's up? Fast guy? Slow guy? If a ball is in the gap, where do I go?' Cutoffs. Relays. Turning the double play. I had to learn all that. It took me 2½-3 years until I actually got comfortable, where I didn't have to think about it, where it was second nature."
But what Biggio wants now, and what he wanted then, was to remain an Astro. So his motto now, like his motto then, hasn't changed: You do what you've gotta do.
Eleven years ago, his manager at the time, Art Howe, was looking for ways to save his leadoff man's legs from the burden of squatting 200 times a night. And it also wasn't exactly a complete coincidence that the Astros had just traded a kid center fielder named Kenny Lofton to Cleveland for hotshot catching prospect Eddie Taubensee.
Now, it's the unforeseen arrival of a gentleman named Jeff Kent that has thrown Biggio's life into its current state of upheaval. When Kent essentially knocked on the Astros' door this winter and volunteered to start driving in his regularly scheduled 100 runs a year in Texas, the Astros found it easier to send Biggio a road map to the outfield than to tell Kent there was a "no vacancy" sign at second base.


The big question at the time was whether Biggio would play left field or center. But luckily for Biggio, the Astros -- being the upstanding democratic institution they are -- gave him a vote.
"He wanted to play center field," says manager Jimy Williams. "He'd played out there before. I know it's been a few years. But the majority of games he's played in the outfield in his career, he's played in center field."
Except "majority" is a relative term for a guy who has been in the outfield 64 games in his career -- 39 of them in center field. Except for a few lineup emergencies, he hasn't played more than a game here or an inning there in the outfield since 1990 -- when he was 24. And he hasn't started a real game in center field since July 26, 1990.
"I know that was a long time ago," Biggio says. "But at least it's not like it's a whole new experience."
How much those 111 fly balls he ran down 13 years ago will help him is a question no one can answer yet. But the Astros already know this is no ordinary athlete.
We are talking about the only player ever to make the All-Star team as both a catcher and a second baseman. So now, for his next trick, can he become the second player in the last eight decades to go from being a regular at second base one year to a regular in center field the next?
Well, says the only other man to try it, it's harder than it looks.
"It's not easy," says Tigers coach Juan Samuel -- whom the Phillies tried to turn into a center fielder, with disastrous results, in 1989. "My advice to him would be: Get your rest. There's a lot of ground to cover out there."
Samuel spent the first two months of that '89 season playing center for the Phillies, then played another 84 games out there for the Mets after being traded in midseason for Lenny Dykstra. The Mets then dealt him the next winter to the Dodgers, who moved him back to second base. And that was that.
But his experience trying to make this same move might offer some insight into the adventures Biggio will face this year. So here is what Samuel recalls, in his recurring center-field nightmares, as being the biggest pitfalls:
Knowing your limits: "I found myself trying to catch everything," Samuel says. "I was going 100 miles an hour out there. ... I think the only triple Alan Ashby ever got (at least in '89), I gave him. I dove for a line drive, and I wasn't even close to it. But I was just trying to catch everything."


Taking charge: "When I was playing second base, I was always good at going back on fly balls," Samuel says. "But in center field, it's about knowing who you're playing with, and knowing which balls other guys could get. One of the toughest things about going to the outfield is that, if you're a middle infielder, if you're not camped under a fly ball, they call you off. But as a center fielder, you're in charge.
"What happened to me was, I'd call some balls too early and then I didn't get there. I thought, with my speed, I could get there. Then I'd think, 'Oh, crap.' "
Too much thinking: "I used to think a lot about my hitting out there," Samuel laughs. "I didn't want to, but I had too much time to think. Now, we tell guys, 'Don't take your hitting out there,' but guys still do it. And I found myself doing it a lot, instead of anticipating situations. In other words, I got surprised a lot."
In the long run: "After a while, I could feel my legs getting weak," Samuel recalls, "just from running back and forth (from the dugout). Then, one day in spring training, somebody hit a line drive to right-center field. It went by the right fielder, and I tried to kick it in gear, and I pulled my hamstring. I could see that coming.
"You've got to run at second base, too, but this is different. That's a lot of short, quick steps. This is more running. You have to back up everybody -- balls hit to the right fielder, balls hit to the left fielder. You've got to back up both of them. You're constantly doing something. That's why I say, 'Get your rest' -- all the running. A few times, I ran a ball down in the gap. Then I'd have to run all the way in, and I was the leadoff guy the next inning. I got back and said, 'Hold on. I need a break.' "
So does any or all of that stuff apply to Biggio and his new excellent adventure? Of course. But that doesn't mean he can't handle it.
Judgment: "It looks to me like he can read the ball instinctively," Williams says. "And he's not afraid to live on the edge a little bit. That's the way good athletes are. He doesn't fear failure, even though it's out there."
Taking charge: "Oh, he'll take charge," says GM Gerry Hunsicker. "This is probably the first time since Cesar Cedeno (who left Houston after 1981) that the Astros have had a center fielder who will take charge of the outfield. I think he'll be very aggressive out there, and he'll communicate with the guys on the wings."


Thinking time: "I'm ready for that now," Biggio says. "I'm 37 years old. I'm going into my 16th season. In baseball, there's always a lot of thinking. I'm coming from the infield. There was a lot of thinking there. At second base, I ran the infield. That was my job. I'm a little older now. So maybe it's good there's not as much thinking.
"There's still thinking involved. It's just not at the same level there was in the infield. But I make myself think about every situation: 'OK, there's a fast guy up. Is there a guy on first? Is there a guy on third? When should I try to throw a guy out at third?' There are a lot of different situations I'm trying to think about. I've got pretty much the whole aspect of the outfield to think about."
The running: "Yeah, it's a long run," Biggio chuckles. "I've noticed that already. It's definitely a lot longer going out there. But I knew in the offseason I'd be doing this. I've prepared my legs, and I've prepared my body. I was running 15-20 miles a week, knowing I'd be doing this."
Maybe the biggest difference, though, between Samuel and Biggio is this: Samuel admits he never wanted to move in the first place, and all he could think about all year was what it would take to get back to second base. Biggio is at a different stage in his career, with clearly different priorities.
To help ease the move to center at his age, he coaxed a one-year, $4-million extension out of owner Drayton McLane that leaves him signed through 2004. And his main selling point was that he wanted to retire an Astro.
"It's baseball, and I love the game," Biggio says. "The game is everything to me. I've had an opportunity to spend the last 16 years playing it here, and this last contract was not about the money. It was about staying here, finishing my career here. Not many people get to play their whole career in one organization. I want to do that.
"When you remember Kirby Puckett, you think of the Minnesota Twins. When you remember Robin Yount, you think of the Milwaukee Brewers. When you remember Don Mattingly, you think of the Yankees. It's an honor to have played my whole career for one team. It's a good thing for baseball when that happens. I wish it happened more."


Well, the script is now all laid out for it to happen here. But for it to happen successfully, Biggio has to make this move work -- and he has to hit.
He hasn't batted.300 since 1998. His on-base percentage -- which was .415 in 1997 -- slid to just .330 last year. He stole 50 bases in 1998, but since tearing his ACL and MCL in 2000, he has swiped only 23 total over the past two seasons.
Nevertheless, he has a chance to be the right man in the right place at the right time -- because, Hunsicker says, "We've been looking for a center fielder for 20 years."
Since the Cedeno era, they've run through Terry Puhl, Tony Scott, Omar Moreno, Jerry Mumphrey, Billy Hatcher, Gerald Young, Steve Finley, Derek Bell, Brian Hunter, Richard Hidalgo and Lance Berkman. Now it's Biggio's turn.
"In the infield, I was used to catching balls in the palm of my glove," Biggio says. "Now I'm in the outfield with this big glove, and I'm still catching them in my palm. But you know what? As long as it stays in there, I don't care."
And given their alternatives, as long as their new center fielder doesn't re-enact the Juan Samuel Story, the Houston Astros won't care, either.

Kevin Youkilis
Boston Red Sox
Position: 3B Height: 6-1 Weight: 220 Born: 3/15/79  Bats: Right Throws: Right
Background
The Red Sox drafted Kevin Youkilis in the eighth round in 2001, out of the University of Cincinnati. A college senior, he'd played well with a wooden bat in the Cape Cod League after his junior year, getting on the prospect radar due to his bat. But questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft. Youkilis hit .317 in short-season ball after signing, but what was especially interesting was his superb strike-zone judgment. He's continued drawing buckets of walks at the higher levels, without many strikeouts, and has quickly become a favorite of the new Boston administration under general manager Theo Epstein.
Scouting report
Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is adept at working counts and outthinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and breaking pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, and he may never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10-14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, and is likely to end up at first base down the road.
Performance
Having spent the last seven weeks of 2002 at Double-A, Youkilis now has the equivalent of a complete season at that level under his belt. This comes out to a .330 average in 136 games, with 110 runs, 33 doubles, 11 homers, 62 RBI, 12 steals, 115 walks, and only 58 strikeouts in 467 at-bats, with a .462 OBP. This is equivalent to a batting average around .305 at the major-league level, with an OBP over .400. Not shabby at all for a 24-year-old, and a great basis for development.
Health record
Youkilis doesn't have great athleticism, but his hand-eye coordination is obviously excellent, and that's the key thing for a hitter. He's had no significant injury problems.
What to expect
Youkilis has nothing left to prove in Double-A, and should get a chance in Triple-A sometime soon. The trade of Shea Hillenbrand opens up a slot in the Red Sox lineup for Youkilis as soon as next year. Right now, Youkilis looks conservatively like a .280-.300 hitter with an outstanding on-base percentage and adequate gap power at the major-league level. Given a normal growth curve, he could be a potential batting champion down the road. That's a big expectation for a young hitter to live up to. Some Red Sox faithful have gone so far as to herald Youkilis as the new Wade Boggs. Youkilis is an excellent offensive prospect, but it is important to have perspective. It's possible Youkilis could settle into Bill Mueller-type usefulness, rather than Wade Boggs-type excellence. I hope fan expectations don't get out of hand and put extra burdens on a fine young hitter.

Cole Hamels
Philadelphia Phillies
Position: LHP Height: 6-3 Weight: 170 Born: 12/27/83  Bats: Left Throws: Left
Background
A very successful high school pitcher, Cole Hamels was considered by many experts to be the best lefty available in the 2002 draft class. But his medical history (see below) scared many teams off, and he ended up going "just" 17th overall. Hamels signed in late August of '02, and didn't make his pro debut until this May. He was literally unhittable at times this year, and may be the best LHP prospect in the game right now.
Scouting report
Hamels has a very good fastball. He throws it anywhere between 89 and 94 mph. The pitch has good movement, yet he often has pinpoint command of it. The combination of velocity, movement, and location was too much for A-ball hitters to handle this year. Hamels is more than just a good fastball, though. His curve and changeup are both above average pitches and he mixes them well. His mechanics are clean and he repeats them consistently. He's very efficient for a young pitcher and has excellent presence on the mound. Hamels is still physically projectable and could add another inch plus 20 pounds to his frame. This would likely boost his fastball even more.
Performance
The South Atlantic League provided very little competition for Hamels, who went through the circuit like a knife through butter. In 74.2 innings at Lakewood, he allowed just 32 hits. He fanned 115. Left-handed hitters managed just a .101 average against him, righties .150. The Florida State League was a stiffer challenge, but he still held his own in five starts for Clearwater, though he walked a few too many people. In a combined 101 innings, he struck out 147 while walking only 39, giving up just 61 hits. His K/IP and H/IP marks are off the charts.
Health record
This is the rub on Hamels. He broke his pitching arm as a high school sophomore. The injury healed properly, and wasn't the same type of break that ruined the careers of Dave Dravecky, Tom Browning, and Tony Saunders. Doctors say he should have no ill effects from it, but the Phillies are understandably cautious with him. They invested $2 million dollars in his signing bonus, and given his undeniable talent, it would be tragic for both the player and the team if he gets hurt. I don't know enough about these sorts of injuries to make any sort of direct, medical/historical judgment. But it seems unlikely that the Phillies (or any other team) would invest in him if there were any actual doubt about his arm. The odds are that if health issues derail his career, it will be the standard elbow or shoulder woes that attack young pitchers, and will have nothing to do with the sophomore break.
What to expect
Hamels is one case where the numbers and the scouting reports agree: this guy is a stud. His ratios are not merely good, but are outstanding across the board. He throws hard, throws strikes, and knows how to pitch. He's the crown jewel of the Phillies' farm system. Hamels still need to prove he can stay healthy, but that's true of any pitcher his age.

More out of habit than anything else, we still refer to baseball as the national pastime.
In truth, the tag hasn't fit for some time. Football began making inroads as far back as the 1970s, and two decades later, it wasn't much of a contest anymore. If baseball still had the hearts and minds of the American sports fan, then football could lay claim to everything else.
By any measure -- TV viewership, merchandise sold, fan surveys -- football rules. The game may not be superior, but it undeniably is more popular.
Some of that is baseball's fault; some of it is not. A look at what switched America's sports pecking order around.
1. TV
If ever a sport seemed made for television, it's football. Neatly packaged into three-hour programming blocks, it provides networks with dependable programming.
What's more, it's as if football moves across the screen, as though developed by a TV executive. While baseball features a one-on-one matchup who stand 60 feet apart from one another, football involves 22 players, all of whom are lined up in an area far more compact.
At the snap of the ball, all but a handful of players are within camera view. In baseball, the opposite is true.
Football's unique setup allows each game to (potentially) be a national telecast. With baseball, it's a hodgepodge lineup with an array of local broadcast options.
Baseball's Game of the Week takes place on warm summer afternoons when people are at the beach, the mountains or amusement parks. Football's national telecasts take place in the late fall and winter, when inclement weather in many parts of the country forces people inside to gather around the electronic hearth.
2. Violence
Football is chartitably called a contact sport. In actuality, it's a collision sport. You can watch a nine-inning baseball game and never see two players come in physical contact with one another.
Not so with football, which guarantees high-speed crashes between players of ever-increasing size and strength on every play.
The more fierce the collision, the better. And once again, TV helps out here, zooming in on these crashes and showing them in slow motion, giving them the look of a stylized ballet.
A very, very violent stylized ballet, that is.
3. Gambling
Football easily lends itself to wagering. Team A is favored by three points over Team B. Pick one and watch your investment play out for the next several hours.
Ever try to decipher baseball odds? There's something in there about one team being plus-130, and the other being a minus-120. You need a degree in calculus to make sense of it all.
Meanwhile, tens of millions watch an otherwise uninteresting Monday Night Football matchup to the very end because they've got the under, or they've picked the team with the nice blue uniforms in the office pool.
The league -- unofficially of course -- helps sanction this interest. While baseball investigates Pete Rose to the ends of the earth, football demands that its teams compile a full and accurate injury report by mid-week.
For the, um, fans.
4. Attention span
Colletively, we don't have one. Not a very long one, anyway, and it's baseball's bad fortune to demand focus and involvement.
Not so with football. A play is run, a replay or three is shown, and before you know, the offense is breaking from the huddle. And never mind that studies have shown that there's actually about 10 minutes worth of action in a given NFL game.
Thanks to TV, it sure seems more.
Baseball, meanwhile, is languid and leisurely. A single at-bat, producing no more than foul balls, can last for several minutes. To the hard-core fan, this can be fascinating and provide time for conversation and analysis.
For too many others, however, it makes baseball d-u-l-l.
For a culture accustomed to the quick-cut edits of MTV and instand satisfaction, baseball is hopelessly out-of-date.
The fact that football is generally played one day a week -- while every baseball team plays every day for six months -- is another point in the NFL's favor.
It's a serious investment of one's time to watch a team for 162 games. Not so with football, whose 16-game schedule better suits the busy lifestyle.
5. Labor peace
Football has it. Baseball can only dream of it.
The last work stoppage in football came in 1987, almost a generation ago, and lasted only a few games. The last baseball stoppage came in 1994 and wiped out half the season, the World Series, and part of the next spring training.
Only 18 months ago, baseball stood on the brink of another disaster, and though it was averted at the 11th hour, the mere possibility of another stoppage did some damage.
It's a perverse dictum, but as a general rule, the weaker the union in a particular sport, the more popular the game seems to be with the American public.
That's bad news for baseball -- whose Players Association is mighty and nearly undefeated in the legal arena -- and good news for the NFL, which runs roughshod over its Players Association.
6. Socialism
Forty-something years ago, former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle had the brilliant business sense to determine that what was good for one team was good for all. Revenue sharing has made it possible for a team in Green Bay to compete on equal footing with two teams in New York and other large cities.
Not so in baseball, where it's every club for itself. Parity has improved in baseball, and likely will continue to do so under the current collective bargaining agreement. But beyond poor management in Phoenix -- and until recently in Cincinnati -- NFL fans don't feel disenfranchised.
Try telling that to baseball fans in small-market cities likes Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and others.
None of which is to suggest that baseball has completely lost its hold on the sporting public. It's still the game that more people attend in person than any other. It's mid-season exhibition game draws more viewers to TV than any other during the summer months. And it's important grab on the American psyche was never more apparent than in the days and weeks following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But baseball has ceded its title of American pastime, and more than likely, it's not going to get it back anytime soon.

You'd go broke betting against the capacity of some athletes to worm their ways through just about all manner of items available in the general category of gaining an edge, no matter what preponderance of evidence suggests dire long-term effects. We didn't just tumble off the truck from Naive Flats, and even if we had, we've got the BALCO scandal to break our fall.
And so, when they ultimately get around to counting chips and divvying up the take, Monday may not go down in history as the day the trouble stopped.
It's not at all the same as saying Steve Bechler died in vain.
A federal judge's decision not to overrule the national ban on dietary supplements containing ephedra caps a year of what by rights passes as lightning-fast governmental action to strike the sale of a substance already linked to 155 deaths, and that action traces almost directly to the February 2003 death of Bechler during training camp with the Baltimore Orioles.
Bechler was using Xenadrine, an ephedra-laced product, in a desperate effort to lose weight and avoid falling off the Orioles' pitching depth chart. He collapsed on Feb. 16, 2003, and died of heatstroke a day later, his body temperature having spiked to 108 degrees. Later, the manufacturer's insistence to the contrary, a medical examiner concluded that ephedra had indeed played a significant role in the development of the heatstroke.
And that was it, evidently. Years of accumulating evidence as to the potential harmfulness of ephedra had come to no particular end, but the very public case of Steve Bechler was the tipping point. Suddenly, the movement was swift and decisive, warnings followed by lawsuits followed by bans, and ephedra-based dietary supplements almost immediately began to suffer in the marketplace. Sort of makes you wonder what might have been achieved if all that evidence had come tumbling forth sooner.
Bechler's death had the odd effect of both raising the conversation about ephedra and, at least in the sporting sense, standing it sideways. Bechler actually was using Xenadrine as part of a weight-loss effort, which may reflect the larger public marketplace but had little in common with the baseball world. Anecdotally, at least, most of the players who popped Xenadrine or anything like it were essentially using it as speed.
In the end, it didn't matter in the slightest. It was Bechler's death that drove the outrage. It was Bechler's death that prompted the review of where things stood. The tragic tale of a 23-year-old baseball player opened doors that the suffering of other more anonymous consumers couldn't.
And, sure, it guarantees nothing, but you knew that already. In the little self-contained universe of sports, it is safe to assume that, among those actively seeking an edge for whatever reason, their attention merely turned away from ephedra-based products (if indeed they used it to sharpen the old reflexes) and toward something else. BALCO, with its discovery of a previously undetectable steroid-like substance in THG, is the obvious suggestion of that otherworld in which the true cutting-edge experimenters are always one step ahead of the testing lab or the FDA warnings.
Bechler's life, though, will stand for something. It was 10 days after he was pronounced dead that Major League Baseball announced a ban on the substance at the minor-league level. It was 11 days after Bechler's death that the FDA ordered warning labels placed on dietary supplements containing ephedra. It was barely two months later that giant health-supplement retailer GNC said it would stop selling ephedra-based substances. It was two months more that Bechler's widow, Kiley, filed a $600 million lawsuit against the manufacturer and distributor of Xenadrine and asked for a banishment of the products from the marketplace.
Now it comes to Monday's action, when the FDA's ban on ephedra-based supplements, announced in December, was allowed to stand. It was by no means the end of the threat, as other substances with ephedrine-like effects are both approved and marketed, and with a lawsuit still pending by a manufacturer of the product, it's premature even to suggest that there'll never be another Xenadrine-type product sold over the counter again.
But it is a step. It's a significant step that was completed barely a year after Steve Bechler's death, a death that seemed so incomprehensible and pointless at the time. It's small consolation to the family living without Bechler, but it is something. And sometimes, something will have to do.

When it was finally over, after four hours and 23 minutes of the most intense and compelling regular-season baseball anyone could remember, the Red Sox and Yankees went their separate ways early Friday morning.
Following a three-game series sweep that seemed to get incrementally worse for the Red Sox each night, the Yankees stayed put in familiar surroundings and the Red Sox headed south.
Which, when you think about, is perfectly fitting. The gap between them -- a yawning 8½ games -- is the biggest since the end of the 2002 season, when the Yankees won yet another division title and the Red Sox finished out the postseason.
Since their last meeting at the end of April, the Yankees have played at almost a .750 clip while the Red Sox have struggled to stay above .500. While a number of Red Sox players bristled at the suggestion that they were now playing for the American League wild-card spot, the stark reality is that the Sox must make up some ground on the division front-runners before their next dance: July 23-25 at Fenway.
Though the series visited one indignity after another upon the Sox -- from the slap-in-the-face embarrassment of Tuesday's 11-3 drubbing to the kick-in-the-teeth late-inning squander in the second game to the hard shot to the solar plexus in Thursday's marathon defeat -- the Sox maintained they had been made stronger.
"We take more from this game than we lose,'' insisted Pedro Martinez, who gave the Sox seven strong innings but was left holding a no-decision. "I bet we'll capitalize on the things we did tonight.''
"They got the better of us in this series,'' acknowledged Johnny Damon. "But this is going to be our worst dip in our year. We still believe we're going to go off and win the World Series.''
First, the Red Sox have some issues to address.
Curt Schilling, who's been pitching most of the season with a bad ankle that requires a painkilling injection at least once per start, confronted setup man Scott Williamson Wednesday night after Williamson had taken himself out of the game, and questioned the reliever's manhood. Schilling's frustration was shared by plenty.
As it turns out, however, Williamson this time had a legitimate injury -- an impingement of the radial nerve of his right elbow -- and will miss a month, a crippling blow to the bullpen. GM Theo Epstein spent much of Thursday on the phone, trying to determine if what little there is available on the trade market is any better than what he has at his disposal at Pawtucket.
Then, there's the curious play of Nomar Garciaparra, who either asked out of Thursday's lineup or was given the night off by manager Terry Francona, take your pick. Garciaparra committed three errors in the first two games, is hitting just .235 (.274 OBP) with one homer in 17 games and appears either distracted, physically limited, or both.
One thing's for certain: The Red Sox don't lack the backing of their manager. As they trudged up from the dugout to the clubhouse late Thursday night, stunned by a reversal of fortune that had seen them go from leading by a run with two outs and strikes and the bases empty in the bottom of the 13th to a sudden, dispiriting loss, Francona was there to greet them.
He slapped them on the back enthusiastically, and shook their hands as if in congratulations.
"Keep [expletive] battling,'' Francona shouted. "You guys are [expletive] great.''
Later, he added: "I've never been so proud of people in my life.''


Though the Sox no doubt welcomed the change of venue, the schedule does them no favors before the All-Star break. They play at Atlanta for three this weekend, then host Oakland and Texas, two potential wild-card aspirants, next week.
If the Sox could, they would take their All-Star break right now.
The Yankees, too, have their challenges. Jason Giambi, who made just one late-inning cameo in the three-game set, has been battling parasites, and now Kevin Brown is doing the same.
Though the Yankees were heartened by the last start from Jose Contreras and hopeful that fellow-Cuban Orlando Hernandez will return soon, the starting rotation has yet to click. Mike Mussina has been spotty and Javier Vazquez, while he's pitched well, is still something of an unknown quantity in big games.
Then there's the bullpen. Felix Heredia may have taken big strides -- his strikeout of David Ortiz with the bases loaded in the seventh inning of the middle game may have constituted the single-biggest at-bat of the series -- but setup men Paul Quantrill and Tom Gordon are in danger of overuse.
Still, the Yankees' lead is plenty comfortable. They have built themselves a significant cushion, which should forestall any panicked trade moves instigated from the owner's box.
Not yet at the halfway point, the division is the Yankees' to lose. History teaches us they seldom do.

The Arizona Diamondbacks made a solid baseball decision Tuesday when they kicked Russ Ortiz to the curb -- but contrary to what you'll read about this almost anywhere you look, they won't be "eating" $22 million of his salary (which appears to be a new record for the highest dollar amount owed to a player who's been let go). They won't be eating one cent, because the money was already gone. The Diamondbacks ate that money the moment the ink dried on Ortiz's laughingstock of a contract.
Here's a snapshot of the Diamondbacks' committed payroll expenses for 2007, as of Tuesday morning:
And here's how it looks Wednesday:
From a financial standpoint, nothing has changed. The D-Backs were going to pay Ortiz his money whether he was on the club or not. The economic term for this is a "sunk" cost: Whether you use the player/item/service or not, you've committed already to the expense.
The decision of whether or not to use the player or product or service is independent of the money committed, because it's already spent. You often see the misunderstanding of sunk costs from people who sign a multi-year contract to use a fitness club, then drag themselves to the gym because they're spending the money anyway -- when the truth is that the money is gone even if they never set foot on a treadmill. The go/no-go decision should have nothing to do with the expense.
Arizona's Ortiz decision is just another go/no-go choice: Since the money was wasted already, was the team better off with Ortiz on the roster or not? Clearly, at this point, the Snakes were far better off without Ortiz. He is no better than replacement level when he makes it on to the field -- which isn't often -- and had drifted further into flyball-pitcher territory even as he moved into the most homer-friendly park of his career in Arizona. Dustin Nippert might not be fully ready for the big leagues, but he's going to do more to keep Arizona in contention than Ortiz is.
(As an aside, Ortiz earned a lot of wins during his peak years -- 99 wins during 1999-2004 -- despite not pitching all that well. Often he has been labeled as a pitcher who "knows how to win." Given that he stopped winning last year, his first season pitching for a lousy team, are we just to assume that he forgot?)
Ortiz's contract was a bad idea from its conception. Original errors often are compounded when teams are unwilling to acknowledge their initial mistakes by releasing the players in question. Roughly one-third of all major-league teams have players for the sole reason that they make "too much" money to be released. And that is just plain stupid; there is no greater fool's errand in baseball than waiting for a player who was never that good in the first place to suddenly earn his pay. Unless you can foist the bad contract onto someone else in a trade, which happens very rarely, you're better off releasing the player as soon as a better alternative arrives.
Recognizing the difference between "eating" a contract and releasing a player whose salary is sunk already is a critical skill for any GM. It should be a question on the GMAT (General Manager Aptitude Test), right after the question about when employing Tony Womack would be a good idea. (The correct answer is D, "Never.")
So no, the Diamondbacks aren't going to "eat" Ortiz's contract with this procedural move. You could argue now that they're swallowing it, or merely trying to pass it like a kidney stone. Trust me -- it'll feel better once it's gone.

MIAMI -- On the most important day of his career, Hanley Ramirez tried to take it all in stride.


Ramirez, the rising young star of the Florida Marlins, was teaching his wife, Elizabeth, how to drive when he got the call from the Baseball Writers' Association of America and found out he had won the National League Rookie of the Year Award.
"I'm very blessed. I'm very fortunate," Ramirez told ESPNdeportes.com from his home in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. "I'm experiencing so many emotions at the same time. I can't describe how happy I've been from last February until now."
Ramirez is the sixth Dominican-born player to be Rookie of the Year, following Alfredo Griffin (1979) and Angel Berroa (2003) in the AL, and Raul Mondesi (1994), Rafael Furcal (2000) and Albert Pujols (2001) in the NL.
Ramirez, acquired by the Marlins from the Red Sox in the offseason deal that sent Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell to Boston, was named Florida's starting shortstop in the spring by then-manager Joe Girardi. The 22-year-old quickly justified his skipper's decision.
Ramirez topped all rookies in baseball in average (.292), hits (185), triples (11), stolen bases (51) and runs (119). He was second among first-year players in doubles (46), while hitting 17 home runs with 59 RBI.
"I always knew I could play, but it wasn't likely to happen in Boston," said Ramirez, who is the second Marlin to win the award (Dontrelle Willis won it in 2003). "I'm grateful to the Red Sox for trading me and to the Marlins for giving me the chance."
Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria called Ramirez to congratulate him on the award, and during the call he gave the shortstop permission to play winter ball in the D.R. with the Licey Tigers.
"I really want to play in front of my people, and Loria gave me that special gift," Ramirez said. "I'm doubly happy now."

"I always knew I could play, but it wasn't likely to happen in Boston. I'm grateful to the Red Sox for trading me and to the Marlins for giving me the chance."
-- Hanley Ramirez

Ramirez was giving his wife the driving lesson when he was informed of the award. "I didn't want to alter my regular routine, and reviewing the driving lesson was one of the last chores on my list," he said.
Upon learning the news, the young couple went home to the house they share with their 2-year-old son (Hanley Jr.) and Hanley's parents.
"My mother was going crazy trying to locate the whole family to throw a little party," Ramirez said.
His mother, Isabel, put everything in perspective: "The first celebration is to give thanks to God for blessing this house."
The new NL Rookie of the Year summed up his emotions: "The best reward is to be with my family in these special moments."

BOSTON -- It had already been a long day for Terry Francona by the time the ninth inning rolled around Monday night.
Francona had begun the day in Philadelphia, having flown there the previous night to attend his son Nick's graduation at the University of Pennsylvania before arriving back at Fenway Park a little more than three hours before first pitch.
Then, as he watched what Jon Lester was accomplishing in the ninth inning against the Kansas City Royals, Francona felt a familiar sensation return from the morning: paternal pride.
As the inning built, a choked-up Francona felt bashful about the swelling emotion until he turned to pitching coach John Farrell and found he was not the only one being overcome.
"He was being a big baby next to me," Francona said. "It made me feel a little bit better."
When Lester was done overpowering the Royals with a four-seam fastball he located up in the strike zone at 94 mph, it was hard to find a face beaming more than Francona's.
"This probably isn't fair to say," Francona said after Lester, 24, became the second under-25 Red Sox pitcher to throw a no-hitter at Fenway since last fall, "but I feel like my son graduated and my son threw a no-hitter  It's probably selfish on my part to even say something like that. But I think it's obvious how we feel about this kid."
Francona's feelings, it turned out, weren't misplaced.
"Through everything I've been through," Lester said, "[Francona] has been like a second dad to me."
No-hitters are, by definition, emotional moments, but Lester's was something truly powerful. Less than two years earlier, he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Now, he had achieved something no Red Sox lefty had done in more than half a century.
The winning pitcher in last October's World Series-clinching sweep against Colorado, Lester seemingly has a knack for big moments. They are made even more dramatic considering his successful comeback from cancer.
"Learning to dominate at the big league level is one thing," Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein said. "But it's nothing compared to what he's already overcome."
From the time Lester took the mound in the ninth, having pitched to one batter over the minimum, Fenway stood as one, just as it had last Sept. 1 when Clay Buchholz had trotted out for the final outs of his no-hitter against Baltimore.
Monday night, Buchholz watched from the dugout, lodged on the disabled list. He recalled experiencing what his teammate was going through.
"He looked a little nervous going out for the ninth," said Buchholz. "It's a different feeling for everybody."
Buchholz had reacted to the final out of his effort with an almost eerie calm before becoming, as he put it, "speechless." Lester, meanwhile, demonstrated his composure by coolly conducting on-field interviews after the final out.
Last season, Lester's battle was so fresh that he hadn't healed -- physically or emotionally. It took much of the year to fully rebuild his shoulder strength. Mentally, he fought against the well-intentioned sentiment of supporters.
They were happy just to see him healthy; Lester wasn't satisfied because he wasn't winning enough to fulfill his own expectations, his own competitive tastes.
Earlier Monday, there was no hint of what was to come. Lester's bullpen session was "terrible," and Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek termed the first few innings "a struggle" as the lefty grappled with his grip. The baseballs were slick because of the cool, dry weather. Lester probably got away with some pitches, too.
The night's best defensive play came too early for it to be truly appreciated. Jacoby Ellsbury's sprawling grab of Jose Guillen's sinking liner to end the fourth was terrific, but few recognized its importance until later in the game.
For sheer drama, it lacked the brilliance of Dustin Pedroia's diving, late-inning stop of a grounder headed for center field in Buchholz's masterpiece, but it served as the perfect counterpoint to that game -- both games were authored by homegrown pitchers and saved by homegrown position players.
Epstein, under whom the Sox drafted Buchholz, Ellsbury and Pedroia (Epstein was assistant GM when Lester was picked in 2002), worried that two no-hitters within a 40-game stretch at Fenway might spoil everyone.
"I hope our fans don't come to think of this as a rite of passage for our young pitchers," Epstein joked.
The success for both Buchholz and Lester -- however fluky, which no-hitters can be -- reflects well on the team's ability to stockpile and nurture quality young arms. But Monday night was validation of another sort, too.
"I think winning the World Series is better evidence that we're doing things the right way," Epstein said. "But it's important, with young pitchers, to celebrate good nights because there are some rough nights along the way, too.
"The development of young pitchers is not linear. It's not a straight line. There are times it's incredibly frustrating. A night like this shows the potential these guys have. Then, there are other nights when you see how hard it is [to develop young pitching]. Every night, all over the game, there are incredibly talented pitchers struggling to get through their starts."
The Yankees and countless other teams can vouch for that. But nights like Monday are reminders of the potential payoffs, too.

SEATTLE -- One is almost 42 years old; the other is 33. One has won 174 games in the major leagues; the other, 18. One has been with the same team since 1995, while the other has been with four organizations since the end of 2006.
But where it counts -- on the pitcher's mound -- Tim Wakefield and R.A. Dickey are more alike than not. Both belong to an exclusive club, which has a membership of two: themselves.
Like some sort of endangered species, they are the only two current major league pitchers who throw a knuckleball. As such, they share a unique kinship.
Across baseball, there are approximately 370 pitchers. Select almost any two at random, and the pair could compare notes and share common experiences.
Not Wakefield or Dickey, though. Nobody knows the troubles they've seen. Or felt. Or faced.
Except themselves, of course.
"I don't mean this as any disrespect to conventional pitchers," Dickey said, "but it takes a special amount of fortitude to throw a 65 mph pitch to Vladimir Guerrero."
Knuckleballers were never exactly rampant, but in the modern era, the game has had its share. Some -- such as Phil Niekro and Hoyt Wilhelm -- were good enough to earn induction into the Hall of Fame.
Some were good enough some of the time to win 20 games multiple times (Wilbur Wood, each season from 1971 to '74) or consistently win in double figures (Charlie Hough, nine straight seasons from 1982 to 1990).
Most pitched well into their 40s before retiring. But now Wakefield and Dickey stand alone, as if threatened by extinction. If they're not the last of their breed, they are, for now, the only links to the game's most unique pitch.
And though they pitch for different American League teams -- Wakefield for the Boston Red Sox and Dickey for the Seattle Mariners -- and their teams face off nine times this season, they're in this together.


-- Tim Wakefield on knuckleball pitchers

"It's lonely sometimes," Dickey said of his existence. "You almost feel like a place-kicker on a football team. 'Yeah, you go over on that other field by yourself.' Lots of guys throw a slider or a sinker or a changeup. But only we throw knuckleballs. That's a bond that Wake and I share."
Monday afternoon at Safeco Field, as the Mariners left the field after batting practice and the Red Sox took over, Dickey lingered in the outfield and talked with Wakefield for almost a half hour.
Even from afar, Wakefield could be seen going through his motion, rotating his hand to demonstrate a grip or a release point as Dickey listened intently.
"This is valuable time for me," Dickey said, "because I don't get to see him very often."
Sometimes the two talk on the phone. Wakefield offers advice and, sometimes, encouragement.
"I can't believe how accommodating he is," Dickey said. "It's kind of humbling because he doesn't have to do this."
But Wakefield feels, if not a sense of duty or obligation, then a certain past debt. When Wakefield was learning his signature pitch, he learned from Hough. Later, after he was released by the Pirates and desperate to reclaim his command, he worked with Phil and Joe Niekro, who won a combined 539 games. Still later, he occasionally consulted with Tom Candiotti.
Now it's Wakefield's turn to help someone else, to pay it forward, as it were.
"It's such a small fraternity," Wakefield said. "When I was coming up, it was nice to talk to guys. I remember when I worked with Charlie for the first time, I watched him throw and carried a tape recorder with me. I can remember Phil standing behind the screen, watching me throw and giving me direction -- 'Take a little off this one; throw this one a little harder.' I can still hear him.
"It's not a responsibility that I feel. But I think it's cool to give back to somebody, to be able to help someone like those guys helped me."
Not all knuckleballers are created equal. Some throw harder than others, and some throw the knuckler more often than others.
Then there are the mechanical differences and stylistic variations.
"We're all different," Wakefield said.
But the knuckleballers share enough similarities, especially when two members of the fraternity get together.
"Think about it," Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell said. "They can't talk to someone else in their own dugout [when they're struggling] because the other guys can't relate and can't help them. So they have to seek out like-minded pitchers to share their experiences. There's some commonality there."
Farrell has learned enough about Wakefield's checkpoints that he sometimes sits in when Wakefield and Dickey exchange ideas and offers some thoughts of his own.
Like Wakefield, who was drafted as a first baseman but fell into the knuckleball as a way to avoid being released in Class A, Dickey came to the knuckler late in life. He took his early tutorials, the basics, from Hough.
But Wakefield, who one day could surpass Cy Young and Roger Clemens to become the Red Sox's all-time winningest pitcher, can offer a master class.
"Where he's valuable," Dickey said, "is with the arm arc, the action on the pitch, the rotation.  Charlie was really instrumental in building my foundation. But now I have to execute it consistently, and to do that, mechanically, you have to be so perfect."
Beyond the vagaries of the pitch, there's the mental aspect. Almost every modern knuckleballer has a career record near .500 because the pitch sometimes is as baffling to the pitcher as to the batter attempting to hit it.
"I've learned that being able to weather all the ups and downs that go with throwing the pitch is very important," Dickey said.


-- R.A. Dickey

In stark contrast to the career of Wakefield, the longest-tenured Red Sox player, Dickey's baseball journey has been nomadic. He spent parts of 11 seasons in the minor leagues and turned to the knuckler three seasons ago.
He just now may be beginning to command the pitch: After moving out of Seattle's bullpen, he's 1-1 with a 1.37 ERA in his past four starts. He'll use the knuckler Tuesday night to try to beat Wakefield's Red Sox.
"I hope we win 1-0, or 2-1," Wakefield said when asked whether he'll feel conflicted. "I want him to do well, and I want us to win."
Dickey echoed that sentiment: "It's not awkward for me. We're human beings; we have a relationship. There's that unwritten code [among knuckleballers], about being as helpful as possible to one another."
Told that Wakefield hopes the Mariners knuckleballer pitches well but loses a low-scoring game Tuesday night, Dickey smiles and nods.
They understand, even if others don't. They know.
"You want to win," Dickey said, "by half a run."

The stat line is unsightly, and it's trying St. Louis pitcher Adam Wainwright's patience. He's a prideful athlete, and nothing galls a ballplayer with high standards more than a failure to perform to expectations.
Here we are, 35 games into the Cardinals' season, and Wainwright has two measly doubles in 20 at-bats. For a pitcher who prides himself on his ability to rake, a .100 batting average is a personal affront.
But he's confident he'll figure it out eventually. Wainwright continues to work diligently in the cage with coaches Mike Aldrete and Dave McKay, and he believes in using every other resource at his disposal. He recently approached Mark McGwire, St. Louis' new hitting instructor, in hopes that Big Mac might have an observation or two to share.
"I said, 'Come on, man, give me some tips,"' Wainwright said. "But he's just so busy. He's been working his tail off with the rest of the hitters."
As Wainwright keeps grinding out at-bats and hoping a few more balls find holes, he'll have to settle for pitching his way into the good graces of his teammates and Cardinals fans. Judging from that set of numbers, he's doing just fine at his day job.
The Cardinals, fresh off three straight losses in Houston, owe their 20-15 record and half-game lead over Cincinnati in the National League Central to lockdown pitching from every starter not named Kyle Lohse. Chris Carpenter, Wainwright, Brad Penny and rookie Jaime Garcia are a combined 15-7 with a 2.08 ERA.
Wainwright, who is 5-1 with a 2.08 ERA heading into Saturday night's start against Reds rookie Mike Leake, might have the best curveball in the majors. According to Inside Edge, he struck out a major-league-high 140 batters with the pitch in 2009. Houston's Wandy Rodriguez and the Yankees' A.J. Burnett were the only other pitchers to record more than 100 strikeouts with the curveball.
Wainwright also has a genuine feel for the art of pitching. He throws his fastball in the 90-93 mph range, dials back to the mid-70s for his hook, and visits numerous radar-gun destinations in between in his quest to keep hitters off balance. During a recent game at Citizens Bank Park, Wainwright threw a handful of splitters against the Phillies; he later revealed that it was the first time he'd thrown the pitch in a game this season.
"I try to change the pace in my delivery and my pitches all the time, so they don't know what in the heck is coming," he said.
Wainwright is picking up where he left off in 2009, when he went 19-8 with a 2.63 ERA and a league-high 233 innings pitched. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Carpenter and San Francisco's Tim Lincecum as Cy Young announcement day approached, so his mind naturally began racing when Cardinals media-relations director Brian Bartow reached him by phone in early November.
"Brian said, 'I've got some great news for you,'" Wainwright recalled. "So I'm thinking, 'Tell me I won the Cy Young. That would be unbelievable.' He tells me, 'You won a Gold Glove.' And I went, 'Shut up! Get out of here! What are you talking about?'"
Wainwright hung up and immediately shared the news with his wife, Jenny.
"She said, 'Shut up! Get out of here! No you didn't!" Wainwright said, laughing.
If Wainwright seemed destined to win any non-pitching award, it was a Silver Slugger. From 2006 through 2009, he hit an impressive (by pitchers' standards) .244 in 217 at-bats. Wainwright's five home runs in that span tied him with Dontrelle Willis for third most among pitchers behind Carlos Zambrano and Micah Owings, and he developed enough of a reputation as a threat that opposing clubs took pains to pitch him carefully.
Wainwright has even made a positive impression on St. Louis' hitting coach -- the guy who spends most of his time tending to Albert Pujols, Matt Holliday and the players who actually get paid to hit.
"I love watching him take BP," McGwire said. "He's got a terrific swing. He's actually really short to the baseball. Unfortunately, pitchers don't get to hit enough where they can zero in on pitch selection. They get maybe three or four at-bats a week if they're lucky, and it's pretty tough to keep in tune."
Athleticism is a great equalizer, and Wainwright is one gifted individual. He was generally regarded as the best golfer on the St. Louis roster before McGwire joined the coaching staff this season. As a high schooler at Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Ga., Wainwright played soccer, set the county record for batting average and home runs, and was a wide receiver, backup quarterback, placekicker and punter for the Red Terrors' football team. He kicked a 60-yard field goal off a tee in practice and tied the school record with a 48-yarder in a game.
"I sort of fell in love with kicking," Wainwright said. "It was like pitching or golf, where the game is on the line and you have to make a big shot. Everyone hates the kicker until he makes a big kick, and then they love the kicker. Then you miss and they hate you again. But the pressure is always on, and I like the pressure spots."
Even though Wainwright stood a gangly 6-6½, 170 pounds, he claims to have been quite the pass-catching threat. But his St. Louis teammates have their doubts.
"We give him a little flak in here about being a kicker," Cardinals second baseman Skip Schumaker said. "Everybody else played offense and defense, and he was out there with one bar on his facemask and no shoulder pads."


“
Adam's a terrific athlete, especially when you consider how tall he is.
”

Before the 2000 draft, Wainwright traveled to Pittsburgh and took batting practice at Three Rivers Stadium. The Pirates considered drafting him as an outfielder, but decided to use the 19th overall choice on lefty pitcher Sean Burnett. The Braves picked Wainwright 29th overall and quickly signed him to a $1.25 million bonus. Former Braves executive Dayton Moore, now Kansas City's general manager, negotiated the deal with Wainwright's brother Trey, then a University of Georgia law student and now an established attorney in Atlanta.
The Wainwrights' hometown of St. Simons Island, Ga., went into a frenzy as the word spread about Adam.
"As the news traveled around the neighborhood and across the island, we had people spilling out into the front yard," Trey Wainwright said. "Somebody came and put a big Braves flag up, and people were bringing over Braves hats and license plates." One friend drew up a big banner reading, "Adam Wainwright -- Atlanta Braves," and it hung in the yard for two weeks.
During his apprenticeship with the Braves, Wainwright went to two spring training camps with the big club and took mental notes as Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz worked on bunting, properly fielding the position, and the other little things necessary to have a well-rounded game.
Although the lessons stuck, Wainwright had no say in his future. In December 2003, Atlanta traded Wainwright and pitchers Jason Marquis and Ray King to St. Louis for outfielder J.D. Drew and catcher Eli Marrero. Walt Jocketty, the Cardinals' general manager at the time, refused to make the deal unless the Braves included Wainwright, who was rated the Braves' top prospect by Baseball America in 2003.
The trade was an emotional jolt for Wainwright, who grew up rooting for some bad Braves teams in the late 1980s before the franchise began its run of 14 straight division titles. Ask him about his boyhood allegiances, and he quickly reels off the names Dale Murphy, Ozzie Virgil, Lonnie Smith and Andres Thomas -- players who were around when things were grim and the Fulton County Stadium stands were empty.
"The boys," Wainwright calls them.
Wainwright adapted quickly to his new surroundings in St. Louis. When Cardinals closer Jason Isringhausen suffered a hip injury in September 2006, Wainwright stepped in as closer and threw 9 2/3 shutout innings in October. He froze the Mets' Carlos Beltran with an 0-2 curve to conclude the National League Championship Series, and struck out Brandon Inge on three straight sliders to clinch St. Louis' deciding Game 5 victory over Detroit in the World Series.
As a student of pitching, Wainwright considers himself fortunate to have Carpenter, pitching coach Dave Duncan and catcher Yadier Molina as sounding boards. He talks the usual good-natured smack about his hitting acumen and seems amused by his budding reputation as a defender. He jokes that his strategy for winning a second Gold Glove is to "get out of the way" and let shortstop Brendan Ryan catch the ball and throw it to first base.
Still, for someone so tall and lean, Wainwright is quick off the mound and aggressive in making plays.
"It's funny when you see people on TV, then you notice so much more when you see them on an everyday basis," McGwire said. "Adam's a terrific athlete, especially when you consider how tall he is. And he's so coordinated. If you want to use the term 'all-around pitcher,' he's an all-around pitcher."
With the notable exception of Pujols, Wainwright might be the game's premier Triple Crown threat. Mike Hampton of the 2003 Braves was the last pitcher to win a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger Award in the same season, but he failed to make a dent in the Cy Young balloting. If Wainwright can get his bat out of neutral, who knows where things might lead? He finished third behind Lincecum and Carpenter in the 2009 NL Cy Young balloting, and it appears he'll be in the mix again this season.
Just for fun, Wainwright was asked how he might respond if Brian Bartow calls in November and tells him he's won Gold Glove, Silver Slugger and Cy Young Awards in the same season. How much of a mind-blower would that be?
"I might retire if that happens," Wainwright said. "That would be the only bad thing about it."

A pennant contender can always use reinforcements, so Chris Young keeps plugging away in the minors in hopes of making a contribution with the San Diego Padres. One night he's pitching relief for the San Antonio Missions in the Texas League, then it's off to the Pacific Northwest for a start with the Triple-A Portland Beavers, followed by a cameo with the Lake Elsinore Storm in the California League playoffs. Young doesn't stick around long, but he makes sure to pay for the food spread at every stop.
It's been 15 months since Young shut it down with discomfort in his right shoulder, 13 months since Dr. Heinz Hoenecke performed arthroscopic surgery to repair an impingement, and five months since Young threw six innings and 86 pitches against the Arizona Diamondbacks in his only major league appearance of 2010.
The initial news accounts of Young's surgical procedure in August 2009 described it as a "minor cleanup.'' In reality, shoulder cleanups are "minor'' only if it's somebody else's shoulder.
After Young threw a bullpen session in February, Padres manager Bud Black said he was in a "very good spot.'' In April, Young went on the disabled list with shoulder tightness and told reporters, "I'm not too worried about it.'' That was followed by an aborted minor league rehab start in May, an MRI and months of strengthening exercises, long toss and simulated games before Young finally received clearance to begin his whirlwind tour of San Diego's farm clubs. He's starting to feel like a kid who's forced to unwrap his big birthday present in installments.
"I want to pitch in a big league game,'' Young told reporters last week. "That's my goal and that's what I'm working for.''
Young's intentions are admirable and his commitment is beyond question. But if he wanted certitude, he picked the wrong body part.
If 2010 is the "Year of the Pitcher," it's also the year of the pitching injury. The Minnesota Twins lost Joe Nathan to a torn elbow ligament in spring training, and made do with Jon Rauch and then Matt Capps in the closer role. Jake Peavy, the Chicago White Sox's presumptive ace, suffered a detached latissimus dorsi muscle in July and hopes to be ready by spring training. And now the New York Mets, whose capacity for generating bad news knows no bounds, just lost ace Johan Santana to shoulder surgery.
The most high-profile blowout of the season came in August, when Washington Nationals phenom Stephen Strasburg threw a 90-mph changeup to Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Domonic Brown and reacted as if he'd just touched a piping-hot stove burner. After two medical consultations, an MRI, lots of internal hand-wringing and some ill-conceived remarks by Nationals broadcaster Rob Dibble, Strasburg underwent reconstructive elbow surgery earlier this month.
The injury was an emotional crusher for Strasburg -- not to mention Nationals fans and the team's season ticket department. But if Strasburg needs a boost, he should check out the 2010 All-Star Game rosters, which featured 11 former Tommy John surgery patients. The list includes Josh Johnson, Brian Wilson, Billy Wagner, Tim Hudson and 2009 AL Rookie of the Year Andrew Bailey.
Select pitchers who have been on the disabled list with an elbow or shoulder injury during this season:
Hudson, 35, tore his ulnar collateral ligament in 2008, and Dr. James Andrews replaced it with a tendon from his hamstring. Hudson returned a year later looking sharp enough to warrant a multiyear contract extension, and now he's a contender for the National League Cy Young and Comeback Player of the Year awards. As Braves catcher Brian McCann recently told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "His sinker's sinking harder. His cutter is cutting harder. Everything has that extra gear to it.''
Hudson stops short of calling his elbow reconstruction a fortuitous event, but he concedes that his time away from the field might have done him some good.
"If you're in your 30s and you have a major surgery, you're obviously concerned,'' Hudson said. "But for an older guy going through Tommy John, you have a year to let your body kind of recharge and get stronger. It's almost like you take a pit stop for a year. You can get your elbow redone and get everything else good to go.''
Hudson's professional peers with shoulder problems don't have such uplifting stories to tell. Mark Mulder, Hudson's former Oakland A's teammate, retired after several failed comeback attempts and is now playing competitive golf. Erik Bedard has undergone two shoulder operations and pitched a total of 164 innings in three seasons with the Seattle Mariners. Chien-Ming Wang won't pitch this season in Washington. Kris Benson's recent comeback attempts with Texas and Arizona fizzled, and Mark Prior is giving it one more shot with the Rangers after an audition in the independent Golden Baseball League.
Young is one of three prominent NL West starters trying to overcome shoulder problems. Colorado lefty Jeff Francis posted a 4-4 record in 16 starts, spent a month on the DL and returned to the rotation Monday against San Diego. And Arizona's Brandon Webb, who has yet to pitch in the majors this season, is hoping to squeeze out a few relief innings this month in advance of becoming a free agent in the offseason.
St. Louis righty Chris Carpenter, pitching's patron saint of perseverance, has seen both sides. In 2002, doctors repaired Carpenter's right labrum and inserted three tacks to keep it in place. His body rejected the tacks and scar tissue formed around it, and he had to undergo another surgery in 2003. The experience made Carpenter's 2007 elbow reconstruction seem like a joyride.
"With your elbow, you go through the program, get the range of motion back and do some wrist [exercises], and the pain goes away, everything feels good and off you go,'' Carpenter said. "When you get into the shoulder, it's a flip of the coin.
"For me, the two big things were getting the strength back and not being scared to let the ball go. I consider myself lucky that I was one of the positive outcomes. But my shoulder is still sore off and on, and I have to continue to work hard at it. You'll never have the same shoulder once you have that issue.''
Several years ago, the American Journal of Sports Medicine studied 68 pitchers over a five-year span and found that 82 percent of Tommy John patients were able to return to their pre-surgery form in a span of 18½ months. That's particularly impressive considering that the procedure pioneered by Dr. Frank Jobe -- replacing a damaged elbow ligament with a tendon from another part of the body -- remains almost unchanged from the first surgery performed on John in 1974.
In 1995, the Texas Rangers began charting the progress of pitchers in the system who had undergone arm surgery. The Rangers found that about 85 percent of pitchers with elbow injuries made complete comebacks, while fewer than 50 percent came back from shoulder problems to regain their previous levels of health and performance.
Dr. Keith Meister, the Rangers' team physician and a James Andrews disciple, has operated on many of those Texas pitchers, along with several prominent pitchers from other organizations. He repaired Webb's shoulder injury in August 2009, and recently operated on Oakland pitcher Ben Sheets' torn flexor tendon.
Although Meister has seen the positive results from Tommy John surgery, he cautions that it's a serious procedure, with risks involved, and said a lot of athletes don't rebound as hoped. Elbow reconstructions are not, as some news accounts suggest, as simple as a trip to the local Jiffy Lube.
"There are a lot of misconceptions out there,'' Meister said. "Everybody believes, 'I'll get my Tommy John done and it's almost a rite of passage, and I'll be back throwing harder and I'll be stronger.' But there are absolutely no guarantees. In my practice, I see a tremendous amount of kids with elbow problems. A lot of them are second opinions, and more often than not I'm telling them they don't need an operation.''
If Tommy John surgery is considered a new lease on life for a pitcher, shoulder problems are often viewed as a death sentence. That's a major oversimplification. But if a pitcher is going to incur one or the other, the track record is better and the road map for recovery more defined for elbow patients.
"The stresses and loads that the shoulder sees are far more complex than what the elbow sees, and the patterns of movement are more complex, so the problem becomes much more complex,'' Meister said. "If we have to rank them in order of problematic, it's rotator cuff, labrum, then elbow ligament. The rotator cuff is the 'tire tread' of the shoulder, so to speak, so when you wear the tire tread out, more often than not the shoulder goes.''
The shoulder is a shallow, ball-and-socket joint -- often compared to a "a golf ball sitting on a tee'' -- held together by the labrum and rotator cuff, and it's subject to extreme forces. The elbow is a "hinge'' joint, subject to less movement and protected by bone. While ulnar collateral ligaments can go in a flash, they're less susceptible to erosion over time.
"Superficially, 90 percent of scopes or rotator cuff surgeries are just a cleanup,'' said Jamie Reed, the Rangers' medical director and head athletic trainer. "You're not repairing or fixing anything. It's like when you take a rope and go over the corner of a table, back and forth, and get all that fraying. It's the same when you get inside a shoulder. It starts to clog up and get inflamed, and that's where a lot of guys have shoulder pain and discomfort. You're basically getting that tissue that needs to be debrided out of the way.''
Pitchers recovering from Tommy John surgery are generally able to pick up a ball in three months, begin throwing off a mound after six, and move closer to pitching in games after nine months. Reed said the Rangers typically prefer to take things a little slower -- with a 4-7-11 timetable.
Cincinnati Reds pitcher Edinson Volquez returned to the rotation in August, 13 months after Tommy John surgery. He earned a trip back to Class A ball for a refresher course because of his inability to throw strikes, but looked impressive in striking out 10 Pittsburgh Pirates upon his return. The consensus is that Volquez will be better next spring, when his elbow reconstruction is five or six months further in the rearview mirror.
What's the rule of thumb for pitchers recovering from shoulder surgery? Meister tells his patients to expect at least a year of recovery even if all he does is go in and clean up a "little bit'' of labral tissue. But former All-Star Jason Schmidt thinks two years might be a more reasonable target for some pitchers.
Schmidt speaks from experience. After signing a three-year, $47 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2007 season, Schmidt had difficulty throwing strikes and was consistently registering between 82 and 85 mph with his fastball.
"I thought the radar gun was broken,'' he said.
When doctors went in for a look, they were stunned that Schmidt could even reach home plate with his pitches. The damage included a torn labrum, frayed biceps tendon and inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled sac that reduces friction in the shoulder. After two surgeries, three victories and 43⅓ innings as a Dodger, Schmidt called it quits in 2009.
Schmidt, now 37 and living in the Phoenix area, follows the game closely enough to relate to the emotional travails of Webb, Young & Co. He remembers how his shoulder would feel fine one day, and inexplicably throb or feel weak the next. He alternated between resting the shoulder and pushing even harder, but neither approach provided more than a temporary respite.
"It's like you're on top of the world  end of your career  on top of the world  end of your career,''' Schmidt said. "That's the hard part -- you just don't know what you're going to get day-to-day.
"After you get your shoulder fixed, you try to throw from your normal arm angle and feel a little pinch there. So you drop down a little bit and don't have that pinch, but you can't locate. And then, since you've dropped down, you start putting pressure somewhere else and your elbow feels sore or you feel soreness in another spot in your shoulder. It's a never-ending battle.''
Schmidt stays busy in his retirement coaching his kids' teams and helping out with a friend's venture capital business. He spoke by phone last week while waiting for his 3-year-old to finish a swim lesson.
Along with the sense of frustration and uncertainty that he felt because of his shoulder injury, he had to deal with the disappointment and guilt of giving the Dodgers almost nothing in return for their $47 million investment.
"That was the hardest part -- signing the contract and getting hurt right at the beginning,'' Schmidt said. "I would love to have those three years back and be that guy to win the big game and help take the team to the playoffs or the World Series.
"If I were still 24 or 25 or even 30, I would still be rehabbing. I wouldn't give up. But I knew going into L.A. that it was probably going to be my last contract. I was ready to spend more time with my family, and that made it easier to walk away from the game. I just didn't get to go out on my own terms.''
From 1995 through 2003, the Rangers performed 48 shoulder surgeries on pitchers in their organization -- an average of about six a year. Then the team made some changes to foster better coordination among the medical staff, trainers, coaches, front office and talent evaluators in the field. When Texas scouts follow players in the draft now, they're more inclined to be on the lookout for warning signs that might spell trouble down the road. Maybe the team will pass on a prospect with questionable mechanics, or the coaching staff will be more vigilant in correcting flaws in a delivery.
Coincidentally, the Rangers aren't doing nearly as many surgical procedures.  From 2004 through 2010, the Rangers performed only 11 shoulder surgeries on pitchers in the organization.


“

With your elbow, you go through the program, get the range of motion back and do some wrist [exercises], and the pain goes away, everything feels good and off you go. When you get into the shoulder, it's a flip of the coin.
”

"That's 37 more pitchers who have a chance to develop,'' Meister said. "That's two full drafts worth of pitchers.''
Milwaukee Brewers pitching coach Rick Peterson is on a personal crusade against pitching injuries. In 2009, Peterson helped found a company called 3P Sports that incorporates his philosophies on biomechanics, conditioning and pitching drills to help enhance performance and reduce injuries for pitchers at all amateur levels. Dr. James Andrews and former big leaguers Tom Glavine and Al Leiter are among the pitching experts involved with Peterson's program.
"What's the best practice to optimize the prevention of injury? First, you need to have a great physical conditioning program so that pitchers can handle the torque and the movement in their deliveries,'' Peterson said. "And second, you need a biomechanical analysis to make sure the delivery is clean. There are certain red flags in a pitching delivery where the prediction of injury is off-the-charts high.''
When injuries do occur -- and they're going to happen regardless of how painstakingly pitch counts and deliveries are monitored -- an athlete's competitive drive and resourcefulness come into play. The best pitchers find a way to adapt, whether it's changing an arm slot, adding a pitch or making do with less velocity on the fastball.
"As surgeons, we all think we know what we're doing and that we can fix you,'' Meister said. "But at the end of the day, the great athletes are going to make you look best.
"I like to say that 'one man's soreness is another man's pain.' Every Major League Baseball pitcher has to throw with a certain amount of discomfort. You either accept that and realize that you need to be able to throw at 100 percent when you only feel 80 percent, or you don't survive in this game. And you need to continually make adjustments. I think that helps explain the greatness of pitchers like Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. And to think -- they were all on one pitching staff.''
By that definition, it's no wonder that Carpenter is so highly regarded within the baseball fraternity. His pitching counterparts who have seen his work regimen and maintenance program have a better understanding why he's been able to endure all the pain, discomfort and setbacks in his career.
Pitcher Joe Nelson, who survived major elbow and shoulder problems to play six years in the big leagues, has seen Carpenter's workout routine first-hand, and he was astonished by the commitment involved.
"I know how hard his rehab is,'' Nelson said. "I've watched him do it. You're talking five or six hours a day on whole-body stuff, and two hours working the most mundane, tiny muscles where nobody else in the world sees the results unless you're throwing a baseball.
"It's a very difficult, monotonous process, and it's not for everyone. Some guys just can't fight through it. It doesn't feel good when you pick up a ball and throw and it hurts every time. You're like, 'Is this really worth it?' But some guys keep banging their head against that wall, and they wind up saying, 'Yeah, it's worth it, because I've made it back again.' ''
Is it worth it? That's a question Chris Young, Brandon Webb and countless others have probably asked themselves during long, solitary hours of rehab. Elbows might be more forgiving than shoulders, but the sense of accomplishment is the same for every pitcher who makes it back. And the search for answers is always the hardest part.

SAN JOSE, Calif., and COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- Despite spending nearly a half-century as prominent evidence of the "curse" on the Cubs, Ernie Broglio cheerfully takes all calls that come his way for appearances, autographs and answers.
But until now, Broglio said, he's never publicly shared what he thinks is the key to the story behind his star-crossed arrival in Chicago.  He added that plenty of people ask him what happened, but few, if any, ask him why he was involved in what might be the most lopsided trade ever.
* * * * * * *
As a rookie pitcher with the Cardinals in 1959, the Bay Area native and his wife, Barbara, spent nearly $21,000 to buy a house in a residential neighborhood of San Jose, Calif. The next year Broglio won a league-high 21 games, had a 2.74 ERA, finished third in the Cy Young Award voting and doubled his salary to $20,000.
Many families with homes on their street have come and gone in the past 52 years.  The Broglios, however, still live in the same house where they raised their four children.
Now a 75-year-old great-grandfather, Broglio has Type 2 diabetes, but he regularly takes long walks, goes golfing and tutors teenage pitchers.
The wall of fame in his throwback den flashes back to Broglio on the cover of Sports Illustrated facing Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda of the Giants and to plaques presented to him for the 1960 season when the young righty was St. Louis' finest. The wall also showcases shots of Hall of Fame legends Bob Gibson, Stan Musial, Sandy Koufax and Lou Brock.
Last week the white-haired and welcoming Broglio adjusted his glasses and drew close to the Brock photo to read aloud for an ESPN camera crew the inscription from the left fielder who was never his teammate. Brock wrote that Broglio was a "hellava (sic) player" and that "history and time have tied us together."
That history goes back to the trade deadline, June 15, 1964. That day began with Brock a Cub and Broglio a Cardinal.
Chicago had a 27-27 record, sufficient for sixth place in the 10-team National League and better than most years in an inglorious era. The perennial second-division team hadn't been to a World Series since 1945.
Things weren't much different at the moment for their archrival Cardinals, who hadn't made it to the Series since winning the championship in '46 and were in eighth place, three games under .500.
The two mediocre ballclubs swapped six players before the deadline, with the Cubs shipping Jack Spring, Paul Toth and Brock to the Cards for Doug Clemens, Bobby Shantz and Broglio.
Brock and Broglio were and remain the significant names.
* * * * * * *
Broglio is up there, or more aptly down there, with Bartman and the Billy Goat in the annals of angst for baseball's longest-suffering franchise.  Brock evokes Redbird reverence befitting the National League stolen-base king and 3,000-hit club member.
But when the trade was made, many considered the deal a steal -- for the Cubs. They had essentially exchanged an unproven and defensively challenged outfielder three days short of his 25th birthday for an established 28-year-old pitcher who'd won 18 games the previous season.
"Everybody thought it was a good trade at that time," Hall of Fame Cubs outfielder Billy Williams said last weekend in Cooperstown, where he returns annually for induction festivities.  While describing Broglio as a "great pitcher," Williams gestured to demonstrate the precipitous drop of the "12 to 6" curveball he recalls the 6-foot-2 Broglio throwing as a Cardinal.
"Perhaps, at that time, the best curveball in baseball," according to Brock, who also was interviewed in Cooperstown.
"The only track record I had was two left feet," he said.
Hall of Famer Red Schoendienst, a Cardinals coach at the time, said last weekend the St. Louis management asked for his thoughts on Brock before the trade. He said he was impressed with Brock's speed and his potential, but "nobody knew that Lou was going to be good that quick and right off the bat."
Brock, who was concerned he'd be demoted to the minors until the move to St. Louis, said the trade instilled in him a new confidence because "I now had value -- who is that value?  Ernie Broglio. What has he done? 20-game winner."
His former team's perspective, Brock said, was easy to understand.
"Broglio could be a starter as well as a long relief man and he had been a winner with the Cardinals, and there was no reason why he should not have been a winner in Chicago."
But Broglio said there was indeed a reason and that the Cubs have never known what he believes motivated the Cardinals to trade him besides the opportunity to get Brock.
"They got a heckuva ballplayer; they gave up damaged goods," Broglio said.  "I think that they knew I had a bad arm."
Broglio said he was already over a problem he had experienced two years before, when he had cortisone shots every other start for a troublesome shoulder, but he had hurt his elbow late in '63 and was still suffering as he struggled to a 3-5 record at the time of the trade.  He said he received regular treatment for the elbow from the Cardinals' trainer and occasional cortisone shots, too.
"I think the Cardinals knew a lot -- a lot more than what I knew of the injury," Broglio said.  "So that's why I think they decided that they send the bad arm problem, get rid of him."
Schoendienst said although he knew beforehand of St. Louis's interest in Brock, he wasn't aware of a desire to deal Broglio. "I'm sure the Cardinals didn't make the trade because they thought his arm was bad.  I'm sure they didn't."
According to Broglio, there were telling signs in some of his bad performances.
"If I remember right, at one time I threw about four or five wild pitches in one ballgame and Bob Uecker was catching and I kind of jokingly said, 'How come you didn't protect me?'  He couldn't.  He couldn't have caught the ball or stopped the ball," Broglio said, laughing.
"They were so far in front of home plate that there was an indication that I had problems with my elbow."
The records from '64 reveal that Broglio threw three wild pitches in a game the Cardinals hosted on May 19.  Uecker was behind the plate as Broglio also gave up five walks in 6 1/3 innings.  The opponent and winner?  The Chicago Cubs.
* * * * * * *
Brock said that when he joined the Cardinals, manager Johnny Keane gave him marching, actually speeding, orders and said he needed to become the team's version of the Dodgers' record-setting base stealer, Maury Wills.  Although he was skeptical, Brock said he came to consider it the green light that turned his career around.
Thriving immediately for his new team in his new role, Brock batted .348 and stole 33 bases as the catalyst for the surprising world champions of 1964.  He spent 16 seasons in St. Louis, surpassed single-season and career stolen-base records set by Wills and Ty Cobb, won another World Series in '67 and a pennant in '68, and earned induction into the Hall of Fame in 1985.
"If he could have stayed with the Chicago Cubs and put those kinds of numbers on the board for the Chicago Cubs, I think you might be seeing we wouldn't have to wait another hundred years to see a World Series," Williams said.
Broglio had just four wins the rest of the '64 season with Chicago, and after his elbow locked up in August, he had surgery in November.   Broglio returned to pitching three months later in spring training but allowed more than six runs a game for the Cubs in 1965 and '66. He won three games, lost 12 and never appeared again in the major leagues.
When told of Broglio's assertion that the Cardinals knew they were dealing away damaged goods, Williams said, "That's how the game was played then.  Any time a general manager felt he could put stuff on another organization, that's what they did.
"When he came to Chicago, you really knew something happened, you knew something was going on," Williams said.  "It probably lost 2 or 3 miles per hour off his fastball; the curveball didn't go down."
"[The Cubs] didn't have a clue about it, and I pitched with pain," Broglio said.
"In those days, you didn't approach the front office, you didn't approach anybody. I didn't want to lose my job."
Cardinals general manager Bing Devine, who engineered the Brock-for-Broglio deal, wasn't with the team to enjoy the first fall fruits of the trade.  He was fired that August, before the team surged to the top of the standings, and was later named Executive of the Year by the Sporting News.  St. Louis rehired him in 1968, after he had missed both World Series titles achieved with Brock.
Devine died in 2007 and Cardinals trainer Bob Bowman, who treated Broglio, and Cubs general manager John Holland, who traded for him, are also dead.

The 1964 surgery to reset Broglio's ulnar nerve left a nine-inch scar on, above and below his elbow that he calls "snake river."   And he said there's also numbness to this day in two of his fingers.
Although he laments returning so quickly from the operation and wonders whether his career might have been salvaged if Tommy John surgery had been an option back then, Broglio said he's not bitter about the trade or its enduring burden.
In fact, Broglio reaped a gratifying benefit from being traded for Brock -- a lasting friendship with him.  Their most recent get-together was two years ago when Brock, whom Broglio calls a "great individual," invited him to a benefit in St. Louis for his 70th birthday.
"Ernie is top of the charts," Brock said.  "He is a good man, a man with integrity.  We have a good relationship because we laugh, we talk, and people, for whatever reason, are still interested [in the trade]."
Brock and Broglio were in Chicago for a Cubs old-timers game in 1987 and were introduced to the Wrigley Field crowd. The reaction to the announcement of Broglio's name, he said, was "probably the only standing ovation boos that any athlete would ever get."
But for Brock, whose superb career was emblematic of many a missed Cubs opportunity, the fans stood and were "clapping, hooraying and everything else," Broglio said.
A self-deprecating sense of humor has probably served Broglio well in coming to terms with his unfulfilled pitching promise and his role in the success of others.
"I congratulate all the Hall of Famers," he said.  "Some I played ball with, some I helped put there."

"This was the worst umpiring performance at an Angels game since Leslie Nielsen in 'The Naked Gun.'"
-- first sentence in my column after Game 4 of the 2009 American League Championship Series
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- I admit it. I've abused umpires.
I've maniacally yelled at umpires as if I was an angry combination of Lou Piniella, Bobby Cox and Earl Weaver ("Are you kidding me!?!?! I was SAFE!!!! I swear to God I'm going to take that &*#%@ base and shove it down your %^#*@ throat!!!"). I've screamed at them from the upper deck, certain I had a better read on the play than they did ("He tagged him on the back of the calf!!!!"). I've ripped them in newsprint and in cyberspace, ridiculing their skills, their sight, their ego and, of course, their high body-fat percentage.
And like all of you, I was convinced that I could do their job as well as they can. No, better. I mean, at least I know the difference between a double down the line and a #*@!&^$ foul fair ball, Phil Cuzzi, you no-good, Yankees-loving, lazy @#$&$@!!!!!
"Baseball doesn't need instant replay. Baseball needs the umpires to get their calls right in the first place.  Is it too much to expect supposedly the best umpires in the business to perform a little better in the postseason? Or to have a little thicker skin when they don't?"
-- from my column after Game 1 of 2010 Twins-Yankees division series
But here I am at the umpire school alongside 158 students who have invested at least $3,000 apiece for the five-week course, the vast majority wearing full umpire gear and uniforms they personally purchased for up to $500, all racing into position and authoritatively barking calls, hoping and praying they will be among the few dozen good enough to receive an offer to umpire in the minors this summer for barely minimum wage, with the dim possibility they could be the one from the class who might reach the majors in about a decade  and I can't even take my stupid mask off properly!
Every time I try, the mask either gets caught on my cap or tangled on an ear or twisted on my neck until I nearly strangle or just generally botches my vision of the play. And that's only on the few occasions I actually remember to take off the mask.
Forget about taking the mask off, though. I don't even put the mask on properly, either. "Never look down while putting on your mask," instructor Tripp Gibson tells me. "You don't want to take your eyes off the field. Put it on with your head up."
For that matter, I don't even know how to hold the mask properly when I'm not wearing it. "Always hold the mask in your left hand," Gibson says. "Because you almost always make the call with your right hand."
And I thought Calculus 124 was difficult.
[Note to editor: Can I delete what I wrote after Hunter Wendelstedt gave Ron Gardenhire a quick thumb in Game 1 of the Twins-Yankees Division Series last October?]
[Note from editor: No.]

"Umpires are human and they will make mistakes. The problem is some still act like God when they make mistakes. You would think they would have learned from Jim Joyce's mea culpa after the Armando Galarraga gaffe that a little humility goes a long way. Instead, Wendelstedt didn't bother explaining himself to the media after the game. "

The recession is bad for the economy but good for enrollment at the Wendelstedt Umpire School.
Nicholas Stewart can attest to that. He's at umpire school on leave from his job as an investigator for the Mississippi state department of employment security. In between umpire sessions, I hear him take unemployment eligibility questions from a student who recently left the army after three tours in Iraq.
Mike Trujillo, 48, a former contractor who hasn't worked in the housing industry since its collapse in 2008, drove all the way to Daytona from Taos, N.M., sleeping in his Ford Explorer and bribing motel maids $5 to let him use a vacant room's shower in the morning. Zack McFarland, 28, is a lawyer but when he couldn't find a job in that profession and was forced out of the Marines due to an injury, he decided to try umpire over lawyer, figuring he would be hated in either job. The $3,650 umpire school tuition/food/lodging tab was so steep for Dave Attridge that he says he literally sorted and rolled coins into wrappers to bring to the bank.
"I'm all in," Attridge says. "And when I say that, I mean I'm all in emotionally and financially."
I meet a chemist, a biologist, a nuclear engineer, a pizza delivery guy, a lawyer, a Christian bookstore employee, a math teacher, a janitor, a bull rider, several veterans of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans, and the self-professed record-holder for single-season ejections in the Dutch pro baseball league. "I was young then and I didn't know when to bite my tongue," Bob Bishop, 48, says of his Dutch ejection record, adding that umpire school has "taught me I really didn't know much about baseball. I thought I did, but I didn't. I will never complain to an umpire again."
Matt Chambers is here on the GI Bill after serving two tours of duty in Afghanistan. "It was 90 percent total boredom and 10 percent total terror," he says of his service. During the downtime, he finished a degree in nuclear engineering. As for the terror, he took a round in the shoulder in Kandahar. The bullet is still there, a painful reminder for Chambers when he lifts his arm after several weeks of making calls in class.
Think about that the next time you feel like getting on an umpire because you think he missed a strike on the outside corner.
Before we go any further, let me clear something up about that strike zone right away so that you actually know what you're talking about the next time you cuss out the umpire who is "squeezing" your team's pitcher.
As most of you know, the strike zone goes from the midpoint between the waist and the top of the shoulders down to the knees. And you also undoubtedly know big league umpires never call the high strike. But what you probably don't know is why they don't call the high strike. Because it's not a strike. The final line in the rule book defining the strike zone specifies it "shall be determined from the batter's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball." Most every batters dips down to swing, effectively lowering the strike zone several inches.
So why don't broadcasters ever explain this? "We wonder the same exact thing," says instructor and major league umpire Ed Hickox.
The official strike zone is just one of the many things I try to grasp at umpire school, along with what base to award a runner after an overthrow, the apparent fourth out (don't ask) and the difference between base pants and plate plants (the latter are flared like early '70s bell-bottoms so you can wear shin guards underneath). This is good. I now know plate pants are what I should ask for at the store to better fit my growing waistline. "I'm going to go ahead and say that they're probably not going to have them in every men's clothing store," says Gibson, 29.
Instructor Brent Rice discusses such finer points during morning sessions at a banquet room of the school hotel. You've probably never heard of Rice but there's a good chance you've seen him on YouTube. He had the unfortunate honor of being the home plate umpire when Braves minor league manager Phil Wellman had his  infamous nut-out, burying the plate in dirt, crawling along the ground like a soldier and flinging the rosin bag at Rice as if it were a grenade. "How much was the dry cleaning bill for your pants?" another instructor asks Rice.
I feel a little bad about bringing that up because it wasn't his fault Wellman completely lost his mind. Plus, manager-umpire confrontations are such a small part of the game. Sure, there are arguments and ejections but they really are relatively rare. The key to avoiding them is knowing the rules and calling them authoritatively in a manner that lets the teams understand you know them.
Which is why we receive frequent tests each morning. "Write your name on the 'graded by' line," Rice tells us when we correct each other's papers. "Do not grade ahead, you are not that smart. Yet."
No kidding. I've covered baseball for 25 years and have seen more than 2,000 games at the major league level. I've watched countless others on TV. I know the game. And I get 20 percent of the questions correct on one test.
One hypothetical scenario we do not go over is one I heard a comedian pose long ago: Say a player has a wood leg and he gets a hit. If he takes off the prosthetic limb and leaves it on first base, can he take a really long lead? "No," Jake Dallas tells me. "If it's detached, it's no longer part of his body."
Dallas, 24, should know. He recently graduated with a biology degree from the University of Missouri at Kansas City and was looking into grad schools for neuroscience and prosthetics research but decided he wanted to ump instead. "My relatives wonder what I'm doing here."
It's a fair question, given that one day a representative of the New York collegiate baseball league -- a summer wood bat league -- visits to say he needs umpires for the summer and is offering the grand salary of $600 a month.
Umpire school is a prerequisite to ump in the majors or minors and just the beginning of a very long and arduous road. Of the 158 students in this class -- their umpiring backgrounds range from Triple-A to Little League to no experience at all -- 23 will receive recommendations to go on to the umpire evaluation course run by the Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation (PBUC), and 45 will be sent for placement in independent leagues. The ones at PBUC will combine with graduates from the Jim Evans umpire school, and the best ones will be offered a job at rookie ball this year, earning roughly $60 per game.
An average of one umpire -- one -- from each year's class will reach the majors. Reaching the majors as a player is hard enough but at least players retire when they get into their 40s. Big league umps hang around longer than Jamie Moyer.
Umpires at the major league level earn six-figures (plus first-class travel) and salaries can approach $400,000 with seniority. But as is the case with the players, salaries below the majors are distinctly minor league. First-year umps earn $1,800 a month. Triple-A umps earn $3,200. Bear in mind that is only for the season, which ranges from three to five months. After that, it's find a winter job to help pay the bills (and good luck with that).
"You spend the first couple years in the majors paying off your credit cards from the minors," says Hunter Wendelstedt, who attended this very school two decades ago (his father, Harry, took over the school from another umpire decades ago).
A good player prospect can skip several minor league levels. Many do. But umpires cannot. They MUST ump at each minor league level, which generally means you're looking at eight years to reach the majors. You can graduate from college and medical school in that time.
"You have to see tens and thousands of plays and pitches because let's face it, in the big leagues there's 17 to 20 high-definition cameras all around," Wendelstedt says. "You need to learn the repetition and the angles and where to be and that just takes practice. It takes developing consistency and that only comes through work, plays, pitches, studying the rule book. Because when you get there, you can't make a mistake."
More daunting, to prevent clogging the system with umpires, there is an up-or-out policy. You're allowed up to three years at each level (though there are exceptions at Triple-A). You could be the best umpire in the minors, but if there isn't room above you for several years, too bad -- you're gone. If you want to continue umpiring, you have to start all over again, beginning with umpire school. At least one student this year is doing just that.
Hickox umpired professionally for 17 years before finally receiving a major league contract at age 36 in January 1999. Bad timing. That was the year many umpires handed in their resignations in July in what can best be described as a poor negotiating strategy. Hickox was among those whose resignation was accepted.
"It took me 17 years to get to my dream job and less than seven months to lose it," he says. "All I had was a two-year college education. I had to find anything I could do with the rest of my lifetime. I went to the local police academy and was a cop for two years. One night I sat down to eat dinner with my wife and I said, 'What if I do it again? I made it once on my skill and merit, what if I did it all over?'"
So that's what he did, beginning in the lowest minors with umps half his age. Thanks to hard work, skill and a labor settlement, he returned to the majors in 2007. He still works as a cop in the winter and also teaches umpire students who will work like hell to take his job.
"If I'm not playing I'll be an umpire or working on the grounds crew or something on the field," says Malachi Moore, a 20-year-old from Compton, Calif. "This opportunity is phenomenal. I'd be an absolute idiot if I didn't take it. I wouldn't be able to look myself in the mirror."
Talking about rules and situations only takes you so far. The essence of umpiring is backing up your knowledge on the field. So after the morning classes, we drive to nearby fields where we put our lessons to practice in batting cages, in simulated games (with ump students manning the positions) and in local high school and college games. When not working in a game, students call balls and strikes off a pitching machine in the cages, watch fellow students from the stands or fill in on the field.
(The students display a wide mix of ability. A couple are overweight and some are not particularly good but many more are current or former college ballplayers with good skills. One even slams a pitch over the distant fence. "You hit a home run at umpire school," an instructor yells. "Congratulations. Now go get the ball.")
Positioning is crucial and demanding. Just remembering where I'm supposed to be on the field is daunting enough, let alone getting myself there in a simulated game. In my first test on the field, I head out to ump at first base, awkwardly moving to and away from the bag, not entirely sure where to stand. I feel like a T-baller.
I'm still thinking about this when Gibson hits a fungo down the first-base line. The ball strikes the bag hard, bounces up and comes right toward me. I leap out of the way as if dodging a bus. I avoid the ball but realize I still have to make the call. I point emphatically with both arms. Fair ball!
I got the call right (take that, Phil Cuzzi) but I was slow to make it and also failed to run to my proper position afterward.
After half an inning in the field, I move behind the plate to call balls and strikes. I stop to brush off the plate and tell the batter, "Son, you best be swinging."
At one point, I decide to show off a bit by raising my arms and shouting the count. "One and two!" I yell this clearly, authoritatively and impressively. There is only one problem. I have the count wrong. It was actually strike three. This probably explains why the batter is heading back to the dugout.
The next batter digs in, I signal to the pitcher to deliver and hunch down over the catcher. The batter hits the ball into the outfield and I rush from behind the plate for a possible situation in the field. I react quickly and properly. Except there is one small problem, to which the instructors alert me. "You forgot to take your mask off!"
I owe Hunter and a lot of major league umps an apology.
Don't get me wrong. Umpire school may be hard but it is fun. Several umpires tell me that it is better than a vacation. And given that the entire five weeks costs less than a one-week fantasy camp, averaging just $100 a day for a shared room, meals and instruction, it's a good deal. A hotel banner even boasts that Dustin Diamond -- Screech from "Saved by the Bell" -- will perform at the penthouse bar. Umpires and Screech -- no wonder Daytona is so popular for spring breakers.
Not every student aspires to ump in the majors, either. Some just want to hone their skills so they umpire better wherever they're at. So during the final days of school, instructor Brian Kennedy calls each student aside and asks whether they would accept a position umpiring in minor league baseball. About three-quarters will say yes.
Why? That's a lot easier to explain than the apparent fourth out. They all love the game so much they could be arrested for stalking.
I've met some major league players who are indifferent to the game -- one former player told me that when he was in the minors, he preferred losing to winning because then they didn't have to play the bottom of the ninth -- but a deep love of baseball is absolutely mandatory for a pro umpire. Without it, there is no way you could endure the years of poverty-level wages, the months away from loved ones, the nights spent sharing cheap motel rooms with a partner, the endless heckling and complaints from managers, players and fans, the constant family sacrifices.
Kennedy worked three years at Triple-A before he was let go. He now umps college games and hopes to get regular work in the ACC (major conferences pay $300 to $500 for a game). He says that in his decade of umpiring in the minors, exactly five major league jobs opened up.
"I had a very supportive wife. I really did," Kennedy says. "But we were separated for long stretches of time. It had to have an effect."
Three major league umpires will retire this year though, which means further opportunities for all these students and instructors. Attridge, the student who paid for the tuition with rolls of coins, finishes school with a recommendation for PBUC and is so jazzed he writes on his website that "A man can change the stars." Rice will work the Double-A Southern League. Gibson will work in the Pacific Coast League, one level from the majors, saying, "I don't see the end of the tunnel, but I can see a little glimpse of light."
And Kennedy? He will ump in Taiwan this summer. He'll be the only American ump in the entire league. But the important thing is he'll be an umpire.
It's like Jim Bouton wrote about baseball's powerful grip at the end of "Ball Four." Once you finally learn to hold onto that mask, it's hard to let go.

HOUSTON --  Mark Appel received high praise from MLB commissioner Bud Selig on Wednesday when the No. 1 overall pick signed with the Houston Astros.
Speaking at a MLB diversity business summit at a convention near Minute Maid Park, Selig praised Houston's rebuilding efforts. He then likened Appel, a right-handed pitcher, and Houston's 2012 No. 1 pick, shortstop Carlos Correa, to two of the franchise's greatest stars, Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell.
"The Astros are on their way to building the foundation that every club needs for sustained success and I believe this club has the right people in place to execute their very sound plan that is going to bring winning baseball back to the fans of Houston," Selig said. "I look forward to the day when players like Carlos Correa and a hometown pitcher Mark Appel ... will be among those who form a new core as successful as Bagwell and Biggio were for so many years."
Appel, a polished and well-spoken Stanford graduate, was left speechless when told of the commissioner's remarks.
"That's, uh, it's very nice words that he said," he said, shaking his head. "Just hearing that comparison is pretty special, especially being a hometown Houston guy. Bagwell and Biggio were two of my favorite players and knowing that Bud Selig sees me and Carlos Correa as potentially the next Bagwell and Biggio is exciting."
Terms were not disclosed but Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said it was "the most significant investment" the Astros have ever made in an amateur player.
The 21-year-old Appel was 10-4 with four complete games and a 2.12 ERA this season. He had 130 strikeouts in 106.1 innings pitched and allowed opponents a .203 batting average.
Appel is an Astros fan who grew up in West Houston before moving to California at the age of 12. The Astros had a chance to draft him last year but instead went with the 17-year-old Correa from Puerto Rico.  Appel slid to Pittsburgh at No. 8 last year but turned down a $3.8 million offer and returned to Stanford for his senior season.
Appel said when he rejected the Pirates, he wasn't thinking about potentially being drafted by Houston this season. When it happened, he could barely believe how well everything worked out.
"Growing up in Houston I came to games at the Astrodome and at Minute Maid," he said. "That was the dream. It was every kid's dream to play for your home team and now it's a reality. It's still surreal. I don't think it's sunk in."
The 6-foot-4, 195-pound Appel will be a welcome addition to the hard-luck Astros with his mid-90s (mph) fastball, nasty slider and improving changeup.
"Drafting and signing Mark Appel was a top priority for our organization this year," Luhnow said. "We are an organization focused on winning championships in the future and we expect Mark to be a big part of that effort."
Astros amateur scouting director Mike Elias raved about Appel and believes he will be a key piece in turning around this franchise which has lost 100 games in back-to-back seasons.
"This is what we believe is going to be a high-impact addition to our organization," Elias said. "He is someone who has the potential to be a front-line starting pitcher for a very long time."
Luhnow said that Appel will report to Houston's spring training facility in Florida next week and that he'll likely begin his professional career at short A Tri-City. He expects him to then move to Single-A Quad Cities and possibly Double-A Corpus Christi by the end of the season.
He said he will be at major league camp next season, but that he wasn't sure when he could be pitching in Houston.
"It's too early to speculate on timelines," Luhnow said. "We need to get him out there and get him pitching."

Florida junior cornerback Joe Haden announced Sunday that he's declared for the NFL draft in what could be the start of a mass exodus of Florida underclassmen leaving early for the pros.
Haden is rated as one of the top cornerback prospects in the draft, and it was pretty much a foregone conclusion that he was coming out. Other Florida juniors who may also come out are defensive end Carlos Dunlap, tight end Aaron Hernandez, center Maurkice Pouncey, guard Mike Pouncey and safety Major Wright.
"This was a tough decision, and I spent a lot of time with my family talking about it," said Haden, who started all 40 games in which he played. "I'm so proud that I had the chance to be a Gator. It's been one of the best experiences of my life. Coach [Urban] Meyer and coach [Vance] Bedford have helped me in so many ways. I'll always be thankful to them for everything, and I know I'll never forget the fans in Gator Nation."
The All-American led the Gators with four interceptions this season and was a finalist for the Thorpe Award, given annually to the nation's top defensive back. He also had 68 tackles, 10 pass breakups, three sacks and two forced fumbles.
The first true freshman to start at cornerback for Florida, Haden started every game in three seasons. He finished with 218 tackles and eight interceptions.
"We're sad to see Joe go because he's a great leader and a dynamic player," interim coach Steve Addazio said. "But we know that with his tremendous talent, he will be a special player at the next level. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for Joe, and we wish him nothing but the best."
The deadline for underclassmen to declare for the NFL draft is Jan. 15.

ATLANTA -- North Carolina State baseball coach Elliott Avent believes players like Georgia Tech junior Matt Wieters come around once every 25 years.
"How many catchers do you see with his size and ability that can switch hit?" Avent asked. "Maybe Jason Varitek. There just aren't many like him out there."
Wieters' versatility is why the junior from Goose Creek, S.C., will be among the first players selected in Thursday's major league draft. He is projected to go as high as No. 2 overall -- behind Vanderbilt left-handed pitcher David Price -- and should be selected among the first 20 picks overall.
"I feel good," Wieters said. "I'm a little anxious, a little excited. I'm just looking forward to it."
Wieters couldn't have done much more during his college career to impress major league scouts. During his junior season, he led the Yellow Jackets with 10 home runs, 59 RBIs, 129 total bases and a .592 slugging percentage. Overall, Wieters hit . 359 with 35 homers and 198 RBIs in three seasons at Georgia Tech.
Wieters was one of only three Georgia Tech players to twice be named a first-team All-American (Varitek, the Boston Red Sox catcher, and Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra were the others) and was named a finalist for the Johnny Bench Award as college baseball's top catcher.
"I tell everybody he's got a very high baseball I.Q.," Georgia Tech coach Danny Hall said. "He's a smooth hitter and a switch hitter. He hits for power from both sides of the plate."
There are only a handful of switch-hitting catchers in the major leagues, which is what makes Wieters so valuable. Varitek, Jorge Posada of the New York Yankees and Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians are among the few. Ted Simmons is considered the best switch-hitting catcher of all time.
Wieters, 21, started switch hitting when he was 5. His father, Richard, was a pitcher in the minor-league systems of the Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians, from 1977 to 1982. As long as his son was comfortable hitting from both sides of the plate, Richard Wieters allowed him to do it.
Richard Wieters, now an accountant, also put his son behind the plate at an early age. Even after Wieters grew five inches to 6-foot-2 during the summer following his freshman season of high school, he remained a catcher.
At 6-5 and 230 pounds, Wieters was easily one of the biggest catchers in college baseball during the last three seasons. Because of his large frame, Wieters has been compared to Minnesota Twins star Joe Mauer, who last season became the first catcher to lead Major League Baseball in hitting with a .347 average.
Hall said Wieters might be further along than Varitek was in his development behind the plate. Varitek was twice drafted in the first round -- 21st overall by the Twins in 1993 and 14th overall by the Seattle Mariners in 1994.
"I think Matt is a very good defensive catcher," Hall said. "That separates him from a lot of other guys."

"How many catchers do you see with his size and ability that can switch hit? Maybe Jason Varitek. There just aren't many like him out there."
-- North Carolina State baseball coach Elliott Avent

Wieters said nearly all major league teams are projecting him as a catcher. A few teams scouted him as a pitcher, after Wieters worked as Georgia Tech's closer during his freshman and sophomore seasons. He didn't pitch as much this past season and had 16 saves with a 3.83 ERA in three seasons.
"We were catching him a lot on the weekend," Hall said. "I think it would have been asking too much from him to squat behind the plate for that long, then go in and pitch."
‌ Wieters' fate in the draft will be determined in large part by whether teams believe he will sign a contract after being selected. Wieters is being advised by agent Scott Boras, the man some teams refuse to deal with because of his history of prolonging negotiations and having clients hold out. Because Wieters is represented by Boras, some draft projections have the catcher falling out of the top 10 selections.
"You hear a lot of things," Wieters said. "I'll talk to my advisers. Hopefully, everything will go as planned. I have all the faith in my advisers. We'll know what's going on."
Wieters is eligible to return to Georgia Tech for one more season. He said he needs two more years to complete a bachelor's degree in business administration. His mother, Pamela, is a teacher at Stratford High School in Goose Creek, S.C., his alma mater. So chances are Wieters will return to Georgia Tech at some point to finish his degree.
And if things don't go as planned Thursday, there's always the slim chance he'll be playing college baseball again in 2008.
"There's always a chance I'll go back," Wieters said. "You never rule it out. But I'm ready to play pro ball."

Hard-throwing left-hander David Price of Vanderbilt was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with the No. 1 pick in the baseball draft Thursday.
Price went 11-1 with a 2.63 ERA and Division I-leading 194 strikeouts for the Commodores. He is the fourth left-hander taken with the top pick and first since Brien Taylor went to the New York Yankees in 1991.
"I knew that I had the talent to be that type of player," Price said. "So, I just had to put the talent and the mental game together."
The first round of the draft was being televised live from an actual site for the first time after being held strictly by conference call in previous years. About 400 to 500 fans were at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex located outside of Orlando, Fla., and commissioner Bud Selig was in attendance, along with Tom Lasorda, Dave Winfield, Darryl Strawberry, Don Zimmer and Frank Howard.
"You look at this draft today, and look at the coverage today, it's really remarkable," Selig said. "Think how the draft used to be conducted when I first got into baseball in 1970. We've come a long way. This is the way it's supposed to be."
With the second pick, Kansas City took power-hitting California high school infielder Mike Moustakas with the second pick. The Chicago Cubs went with California high school third baseman Josh Vitters, who was at the draft and posed with his Cubs hat and jersey next to Selig -- the first in the event's history to do so.
"This was really important -- a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Vitters said. "I'm glad to be part of it. There's definitely some electricity, especially before I got picked. My heart was racing."
Next, Clemson lefty Daniel Moskos went to Pittsburgh. Baltimore selected Georgia Tech catcher Matt Wieters with the fifth overall selection.
About two dozen Devil Rays fans chanted "Let's Go Rays!" and "We Want Price!" during the commercial break after Selig made a few opening remarks and Tampa Bay went on the clock. Each team had five minutes to make its first-round pick.
It was the third time in franchise history the Devil Rays had the top pick and first since they took outfielder Delmon Young in 2003. Tampa Bay took an outfielder with its first No. 1 pick in 1999.
Price's dominant season came to a surprising end in the regionals when his top-ranked Commodores lost to Michigan on Monday. In that game, he came on in relief and took his first loss of the year after striking out 17 against Austin Peay three days earlier. Projected as a future staff ace in the majors, Price has a fastball measured in the mid-90s. He mixes it well with an outstanding slider and changeup.
Moustakas, California's career high school home run leader with 52, hit a state-record 24 this season while leading Chatsworth High School to the city title at Dodger Stadium. The left-handed slugger played shortstop in high school but projects more as a corner infielder in the pros.
Vitters, considered by many to be the top high school player in the draft, hit .360 with nine HRs and 29 RBIs -- despite missing two weeks with pneumonia -- for Cypress High School.
Moskos moved from his role as closer to starter midway through this season for the Tigers. He was just 3-5 with a 2.91 ERA heading into super regionals but has three potentially dominant pitches.
Wieters, a 6-foot-5 catcher, is outstanding defensively and has a strong, accurate arm, but his powerful bat should get him to the majors quickly. He hit .358 with 10 homers and 59 RBIs for the Yellow Jackets this season.
Missouri State lefty Ross Detwiler went sixth overall to Washington. Milwaukee then selected slugging Florida first baseman Matt LaPorta, despite having Prince Fielder seemingly entrenched at the position.
Right-handed closer Casey Weathers, Price's teammate on the Commodores, went next to Colorado. Arizona selected Jarrod Parker, an Indiana high school right-hander with what was considered the best fastball among prep pitchers. San Francisco rounded out the top 10 picks by taking North Carolina high school lefty Madison Bumgarner.
Canadian right-hander Phillippe Aumont went to Seattle at No. 11; Florida took third baseman Matt Dominguez, Moustakas' high school teammate; Cleveland selected Lewis-Clark State third baseman Beau Mills, the son of Boston bench coach and former big-leaguer Brad Mills; Atlanta picked a hometown kid, selecting Georgia high school outfielder Jason Heyward; and Pennsylvania high school catcher Devin Mesoraco went to Cincinnati at No. 15.
Toronto selected Texas high school infielder Kevin Ahrens with the first of its two first-round picks and took Tennessee catcher J.P. Arencibia at No. 21.
Texas, also with two first-rounders, took right-hander Blake Beavan from Irving High School in Texas with the 17th selection and followed that by taking Florida high school right-hander Michael Main at No. 24.
St. Louis took Oklahoma high school shortstop Pete Kozma at No. 18; Rice left-hander Joe Savery went to Philadelphia next; and Texas high school righty Chris Withrow was picked by the Los Angeles Dodgers to complete the top 20 selections.
With its two picks, San Francisco took Arizona high school righty Tim Alderson at No. 22 and Mississippi high school outfielder Wendell Fairley at No. 29.
Arkansas left-hander Nick Schmidt went 23rd to San Diego; the Chicago White Sox took University of San Francisco lefty Aaron Poreda at No. 25; Oakland followed by selecting UC Riverside righty James Simmons; New Jersey high school righty Rick Porcello went to Detroit; and Kentucky high school outfielder Ben Revere went to Minnesota.
The New York Yankees capped the first round by selecting 6-foot-10 North Carolina State right-hander Andrew Brackman, who quit the basketball team after his sophomore season to focus on pitching.
In addition to being televised, this year's draft brings about one major rule change that's sure to affect contract negotiations. There's an Aug. 15 deadline for signing players under terms of the new collective bargaining agreement. If a player selected in the early rounds fails to sign, the team that drafted him will receive a comparable pick in 2008.
The draft wrapped up after five rounds and will resume Friday around 11:30 a.m. EDT, with teams picking through 50 rounds.

There will be two baseball drafts on Thursday. The Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft will begin the professional careers of some of the game's future stars. The second draft will recognize some of those who might have been stars, but never got the chance.
Prior to the Major League draft at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Major League Baseball will hold a special Negro Leagues Player Draft. Each Major League club will "draft" surviving former Negro Leagues players, who will represent every player who did not have the opportunity to play baseball in the major leagues.


--Jimmie Lee Solomon, MLB's executive VP for baseball operations

"Commissioner [Bud] Selig has really made a point the last two years to commemorate the Negro Leagues, its history, its legacy," said Jimmie Lee Solomon, MLB's executive vice president for baseball operations. "He has helped get Negro League players inducted in the Hall of Fame, he has established an unqualified pension plan and has helped organize various celebrations by the clubs. This was all done around the Jackie Robinson celebration because baseball truly became the national pastime when Jackie Robinson came in. And a big part of Jackie's celebration is the history of the Negro Leagues."
The idea for the draft came from a collaboration of ideas from, among others, Selig, Solomon and Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, a vice president/senior adviser for the Padres.
"Some of these players are in their 100s, 90s, 80s -- they're not going to be with us for a long time, so this was an opportunity to pay tribute to them  they should be there," Solomon said. "Some of them are so excited, they're speechless. Others are so excited, they can't stop talking. There is a tremendous outpouring of emotion. They don't know how glitzy this is going to be, seeing their faces up there on the big screen. It will be a great day for them."
Pitcher Mamie "Peanut" Johnson (she was only 5-foot-4 and 120 pounds, hence the nickname) will be drafted by the Washington Nationals. She won 33 games for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1953 to '55, making her the first woman to win a game in a men's professional baseball league. She was once a teammate of Hank Aaron, and was included in the first group of eight players inducted into the Negro Leagues Wall of Fame at County Stadium in Milwaukee in 1997.
Country and western singer Charley Pride will be drafted by the Texas Rangers. He pitched for the Memphis Black Sox and the Birmingham Black Barons during the 1950s. In 1956, he pitched for a Negro Leagues All-Star team against a team of African-American Major League stars, including Aaron, Willie Mays and Ernie Banks. Pride struck out 12, and took a 1-0 lead into the ninth inning, but the major leaguers scored two runs in the inning. After making it big in the music industry, Pride went to spring training several years with the Rangers. He once served as the "designated pinch hitter'' in a spring training game, and went 1-for-2.
Pride's brother, Mack (Mack The Knife) Pride Jr., a pitcher for the Memphis Red Sox and Kansas City Monarchs, will be drafted by the Rockies. Infielder Emilio "Millito" Navarro, who played for the Cuban Stars, will be taken by the Yankees. He is 102 years old, and is believed to be the oldest living professional baseball player. Pitcher Walter McCoy will be drafted by the Padres. He played for the Chicago American Giants and the Kansas City Monarchs, and set a league pitching record by winning 11 consecutive games, two of which came against Hall of Fame pitcher Whitey Ford of the New York Yankees.
"All of these former players have interesting stories to tell," Solomon said. "They didn't have the opportunity. Now they will."

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- With the clock on the large television monitor ticking down to zero and a cluster of fans chanting from the balcony, commissioner Bud Selig stepped to the podium and announced that the Tampa Bay Rays had selected high school shortstop Tim Beckham with the No. 1 pick in the baseball draft.
Oh, how times have changed.
The annual 50-round marathon that began Thursday is no longer strictly held by conference call. A portion of the first day was televised live for the second consecutive year from Disney World with about 400 boisterous fans and autograph seekers in house, along with some of baseball's biggest names, including Hall of Famers Al Kaline, Billy Williams and Dave Winfield.
"It's come a long way," said former major league pitcher Brian Anderson, recalling 15 years ago when he gathered with family and friends around a telephone in his Ohio apartment waiting for a call from the team drafting him.
"You didn't even know what time the draft started then. I found out the night before," the third overall pick in 1993 added. "This is awesome. This is great for the game."
Only one thing was missing -- prospects.
One, Aaron Hicks, a high school outfielder and alumnus of baseball's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, Calif., attended with his family and went on stage to shake hands with Selig and pose for pictures after the Minnesota Twins made him the 14th pick.
Many in the crowd wore Rays T-shirts and cheered wildly when Selig announced the selection of Beckham, the talented high school shortstop from Griffin, Ga., that Tampa Bay picked over Florida State catcher Buster Posey.
Beckham was recognized as one of the best pure athletes in the draft and labeled a legitimate five-tool player. He established himself as the top prep prospect in the nation with solid performances at last summer's high school showcase events and hit .482 with six homers, 13 doubles, 41 RBIs and 23 stolen bases as a senior.
"I found out this morning. ... The scouting director gave me a call and the general manager gave me a call. It was crazy. I was about to do a back flip in my room," Beckham said.
"It means everything in the world. I've worked this hard the last three or four years, me and my brothers and my dad. This means all the hard work paid off. I hope to become an All-Star and after that I want to become a Hall of Famer."
With the second pick, the Pittsburgh Pirates chose sweet-swinging Vanderbilt third baseman Pedro Alvarez. Florida high school first baseman Eric Hosmer went third to the Kansas City Royals, and the Baltimore Orioles took top college pitching prospect Brian Matusz out of San Diego with the fourth pick.
This is the second year in a row the Rays have had the No. 1 pick. David Price, a hard-throwing left-hander from Vanderbilt, was the choice in 2007 and is off to a great start with Class-A Vero Beach.
Beckham is the third high school shortstop taken No. 1 overall in the last five years, joining Justin Upton (Arizona, 2005) and Matt Bush (San Diego, 2004).
While there's always pressure to get the No. 1 pick right, the improving Rays imposed some extra heat on themselves this time because they're hoping it will be years before they'll be in a position to select first again.
Tampa Bay whittled its list of candidates for the top pick to five, then trimmed it to two -- Beckham and Posey, a converted shortstop who developed into one of college baseball's top offensive and defensive catchers over the past year.
"It was an active debate, but I think at the end of the day when push came to shove and we were racing time, I think it was pretty clear to everybody that Tim Beckham was the guy at the top of our board," Rays executive vice president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.
"We feel like he's got an advanced approach to the game, a genuine enthusiasm for what he does, and we feel like he's got a great chance to be an impact player in the major leagues."
The Rays called Posey a few hours before the draft to inform him that they were going to select Beckham. The Florida State star, hitting a Division I-leading .468 heading into this week's NCAA super regionals, wound up going to the San Francisco Giants with the fifth pick.
The Florida Marlins, picking sixth, took California high school catcher Kyle Skipworth, whom many consider the top prep prospect at his position since Joe Mauer was selected No. 1 overall by Minnesota seven years ago.
Rounding out the top 10, the Cincinnati Reds took Miami slugger Yonder Alonso seventh, the Chicago White Sox picked Georgia shortstop Gordon Beckham (no relation to Tim) eighth, the Washington Nationals tabbed Missouri pitcher Aaron Crow and the Houston Astros selected Stanford catcher Jason Castro.
It's the fourth time Tampa Bay has had the No. 1 pick in the club's 11-season history. It picked outfielders Josh Hamilton in 1999 and Delmon Young in 2003.
The Rays think the 18-year-old Beckham is more advanced offensively than defensively at this point, but they're confident he has the athleticism, work ethic and attitude to become a complete player.
Second baseman Jemile Weeks, brother of Milwaukee's Rickie Weeks, was one of three University of Miami players selected in the opening round, going to the Oakland Athletics at No. 12.
While six first basemen were selected within the first 23 picks, only two pitchers -- Matusz and Crow -- were taken in the top 10. But seven pitchers were chosen during a 10-pick stretch from No. 19 to No. 28, where the New York Yankees went for California prep right-hander Gerrit Cole.
Two teams, Minnesota and the New York Mets, had two picks in the first round.
After taking Hicks at No. 14, the Twins selected Miami pitcher Carlos Gutierrez 27th. The Mets took Arizona State first baseman Ike Davis 18th and South Carolina shortstop Reese Havens 22nd.
Davis is the son of former big league pitcher Ron Davis. Daniel Schlereth, the University of Arizona pitcher selected 26th by the Diamondbacks, is the son of former Broncos offensive lineman and current ESPN football analyst Mark Schlereth.
In the sixth round, the Chicago White Sox selected Wichita State center fielder Kenny Williams Jr., son of the team's general manager.
